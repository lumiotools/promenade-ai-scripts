The Nasdaq notification letter does not result in the immediate delisting of the Registrant’s ordinary shares, and the shares will continue to trade uninterrupted under the symbol “CSCW.”\n\nPursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Registrant has a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until April 25, 2022 (the “Compliance Period”), to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirement. If at any time during the Compliance Period, the closing bid price per share of the Registrant's ordinary shares is at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive and up to 20 days business days, Nasdaq will provide the Registrant a written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed.\n\nIn the event the Registrant does not regain compliance by April 25, 2022, the Registrant may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period. To qualify, the Registrant will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for Nasdaq, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, including by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Registrant chooses to implement a reverse stock split, it must complete the split no later than ten business days prior to the expiration of the second compliance period.\n\nOn October 28, 2021, the Registrant issued a press release entitled “Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.

This report announces closing of the SPA and files additional documents in connection with the Offering (as defined below).\n\n**_Entry into Material Definitive Agreements_**\n\nOn September 24, 2021, the Company and certain institutional investors entered into a SPA, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell such institutional investors units with each unit consisting of one ordinary share and one warrant to purchase 0.7 ordinary share, at a purchase price of $0.68 per unit, for gross proceeds approximately $21.5 million (the “**Offering** ”) before deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses. An aggregate of 31,624,923 ordinary shares and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 22,137,448 ordinary shares (the “**Investor Warrants** ”) were agreed to be issued to the investors under the SPA.\n\nThe Investor Warrants are exercisable immediately upon the date of issuance and exercisable at $1.00 per share. The Investor Warrants will expire 36 months from the date of issuance. Each Investor Warrant is subject to anti-dilution provisions to reflect stock dividends and splits or other similar transactions. In the event that the Company grants, issues or sells any Purchase Rights, as defined in the Investor Warrants, holders of the Investor Warrants will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of ordinary shares acquirable upon complete exercise of the Investor Warrant immediately before the grant, issuance, or sale of the Purchase Rights.\n\nThe Company currently intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering for general corporate and working capital purposes. The Offering closed on September 28, 2021.\n\nThe Company also entered into a placement agency agreement dated September 24, 2021 (the “**Placement Agency Agreement** ”) with FT Global Capital, Inc., as exclusive placement agent (the “**Placement Agent** ”), pursuant to which the Placement Agent agreed to act as the placement agent in connection with the Offering. The Company agreed to pay the Placement Agent an aggregate fee equal to 7.0% of the gross proceeds raised in the Offering and grant the Placement Agent warrants to purchase certain number of ordinary shares equal to three percent (3%) of the aggregate number of Shares placed in the Offering (“**Placement Agent Warrant** s”). The Company issued Placement Agent Warrants to purchase 948,748 ordinary shares to the placement agent. The Placement Agent Warrants are exercisable immediately upon the date of issuance and exercisable at $1.00 per share. The Placement Agent Warrants have the same terms as the Investor Warrants; provided, however, that the Placement Agent Warrants may not be exercised until one hundred eighty (180) days after the closing of the Offering and expire thirty-six (36) months after they become exercisable.\n\nA form of the Investor Warrant, Placement Agent Warrant, the SPA, and the Placement Agent Agreement are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2, 10.1, 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 6-K and such documents are incorporated herein by reference.

The purchasers in this offering will also receive warrants to initially purchase an aggregate of 22,137,448 Ordinary Shares with a per share exercise price of $1.00. The warrants are exercisable immediately as of the date of issuance and expire 36 months from the date of issuance. A holder of the warrants also will have the right to exercise its warrants on a cashless basis if the registration statement or prospectus contained therein is not available for the issuance of the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise thereof.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the Ordinary Shares and warrants, see the section entitled “Description of Our Securities We Are Offering” beginning on page S-9. There is no established public trading market for the warrants, and we do not expect a market to develop. We do not intend to apply to list the warrants on any securities exchange.\n\nOur Ordinary Shares trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “CSCW.” On September 23, 2021, the closing sale price of our Ordinary Shares was $0.87 per share.\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus supplement, the aggregate market value of our outstanding Ordinary Shares held by non-affiliates was approximately $95,357,767.23 based on 109,606,629 outstanding Ordinary Shares held by non-affiliates, and a per share price of $0.87, which was the last reported price on the NASDAQ Capital Market of our Ordinary Shares on September 23, 2021.\n\nWe have retained FT Global Capital, Inc. to act as the exclusive placement agent to use its best efforts to solicit offers from investors to purchase the securities in this offering. The placement agent has no obligation to buy any securities from us or to arrange for the purchase or sale of any specific number or dollar amount of securities. The placement agent is not purchasing or selling any Ordinary Shares or warrants in this offering. We will pay the placement agent a fee equal to the sum of 7.0% of the aggregate purchase price paid by investors placed by the placement agent. Additionally, we will issue to the placement agent warrants to purchase 948,748 Ordinary Shares on substantially the same terms as the warrants sold in this offering, except that the placement agent warrants shall not be exercisable for a period of 6 months and shall expire 36 months after issuance and shall have no anti-dilution protection other than adjustments based on stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar recapitalization transactions. The placement agent warrant and Ordinary Shares underlying such warrant are being registered herein.\n\nWe estimate the total expenses of this offering, excluding the placement agency fees, will be approximately $0.5 million. Because there is no minimum offering amount, the actual offering amount, the placement agency fees and net proceeds to us, if any, in this offering may be substantially less than the total offering amounts set forth above. We are not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of the securities offered in this offering. Assuming we complete the maximum offering, the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately $21.5 million, not including the exercise of any warrants. We expect to deliver the shares and warrants to the purchasers on or before September 28, 2021.\n\n**Per Unit** | **Total**  \n---|---  \nPublic offering price | $ | 0.68 | 21,504,948.32  \nPlacement agent fees(1) | $ | 0.0476 | 1,505,346.38  \nOffering proceeds to us, before expenses | $ | 0.6324 | 19,999,601.94  \n(1) | See “Plan of Distribution” for additional information regarding total compensation payable to the placement agent, including expenses for which we have agreed to reimburse the placement agent.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Our business and holding our Ordinary Shares involve a high degree of risk.

(formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.) was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C-corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, we changed our name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc.\n\nOn August 20, 2018, CACM was incorporated in the State of New York and is wholly owned by us. The establishment of CACM was to expand the Company’s business in the U.S. CACM has not commenced operations. \n\nOn December 27, 2018, we consummated a re-domicile merger pursuant to which we merged with and into China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Cayman Islands exempted company and the surviving entity in the merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger adopted in July 2018. As a result of the merger, the Company is now governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nOn July 16, 2019, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of the Company’s memorandum and articles of association which was approved by the Company’s shareholders, the Company’s name was changed from China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. to Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”) and its shareholders. On February 14, 2020, the Company consummated the acquisition of Sunway Kids whereby we issued 1,989,262 ordinary shares and $2 million of cash to be paid in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding share capital of Sunway Kids. The $2 million cash consideration is payable in five installments over five years according to an earn-out schedule. Sunway Kids thereby became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Prior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, our core business was the concrete business in China. Through Sunway Kids and its variable interest entity, we were engaged in providing education and health services to day-care and preschools in China.\n\nOn March 10, 2020, CACM entered into a certain joint venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Baydolphin, Inc., a company organized under the laws of New York (“Baydolphin”). Pursuant to the JV Agreement, CACM and Baydolphin have established a limited liability company under the laws of New York, Baytao LLC (“Baytao”), which planned to be the 100% owner of one or more operating entities in the U.S. to engage in the business of online and offline after-school education.\n\nOn May 1, 2020, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of its memorandum and articles of association (which was approved by the Company’s shareholders), the Company’s name was changed from Huitao Technology Co., Ltd. to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nS-1\n\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company completed the disposition (the “Disposition”) of its former subsidiary, Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (“BVI-ACM”), after obtaining its shareholders’ approval on April 27, 2020 and satisfaction or waiver of all other closing conditions. Upon the closing of the Disposition, Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He became the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. Through the Deposition, the Company exited the concrete business.\n\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”), a Hong Kong limited company, and shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company will acquire all of the outstanding issued shares and other equity interests in Color China from the sellers (the “Acquisition”). On June 3, 2020, the transaction contemplated by the Exchange Agreement was consummated when the Company issued 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company to the Sellers and the Sellers transferred all of Color China’s issued and outstanding shares to the Company. Immediately after the Acquisition, Color Star owns 100% of Color China. Headquartered in Hong Kong, China, Color China is an emerging performance equipment and music education provider with a significant collection of performance specific assets and unique experience in working with many renowned artists.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the Company and the former shareholders of Sunway Kids entered into an Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment”) to the Share Exchange Agreement dated December 31, 2019, as amended. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company shall not make any Earn-out Payment to the former shareholders of Sunway Kids since Sunway Kids has been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and management of Sunway Kids believes it will be very difficult to achieve its projected financial results. On the same day, Sunway Kids and Yanliang Han (the “Purchaser”), an unrelated third party, entered into certain share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Disposition SPA on June 25, 2020, the Purchaser became the sole shareholder of Sunway Kids and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by Sunway Kids. By disposing Sunway Kids, the Company exited the preschool children online education service.\n\nEffective October 1, 2020, the Company changed the ticker symbol of its Ordinary Shares traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market from “HHT” to “CSCW”, representing the abbreviation of “Color Star Color World.” Our online platform Color World is the new focus of our business.\n\nOn June 18, 2021, Modern Pleasure International Limited, a limited liability company, was incorporated in Hong Kong and is wholly owned by us. Modern Pleasure International Limited has not commenced operations.\n\nOn June 29, 2021, CACM entered into a share purchase agreement with Baydolphin.

In addition, we do not intend to apply to list the warrants on any securities exchange.  \n  \nUnless specifically stated otherwise, the information in this prospectus supplement excludes 23,086,195 Shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants to be issued in this offering (including warrants issued to the placement agent), at a per share exercise price of $1.00 for warrants to be issued to the investors and the placement agent.\n\nS-4\n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n_Before you make a decision to invest in our securities, you should consider carefully the risks described below, together with other information in this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the information incorporated by reference herein and therein. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our Ordinary Shares to decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations and could result in a complete loss of your investment._\n\n**RISKS RELATED TO THIS OFFERING**\n\n**Since we have some discretion in how we use the proceeds from this offering, we may use the proceeds in ways with which you disagree.**\n\nWe have not allocated specific amounts of the net proceeds from this offering for any specific purpose. Accordingly, subject to any agreed upon contractual restrictions under the terms of the securities purchase agreement, our management will have some flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. You will be relying on the judgment of our management with regard to the use of these net proceeds, and subject to any agreed upon contractual restrictions under the terms of the purchase agreement, you will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. It is possible that the net proceeds will be invested in a way that does not yield a favorable, or any, return for us. The failure of our management to use such funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\n\n**There is no minimum offering amount required to consummate this offering.**\n\nThere is no minimum offering amount which must be raised in order for us to consummate this offering. Accordingly, the amount of money raised may not be sufficient for us to meet our business objectives. Moreover, if only a small amount of money is raised, all or substantially all of the offering proceeds may be applied to cover the offering expenses and we will not otherwise benefit from the offering. In addition, because there is no minimum offering amount required, investors will not be entitled to a return of their investment if we are unable to raise sufficient proceeds to meet our business objectives.\n\n**You will experience immediate dilution in the book value per share you purchase.**\n\nBecause the price per share being offered is substantially higher than the book value per share of our Ordinary Shares, you will suffer substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of the Ordinary Shares you purchase in this offering. After giving effect to the sale by us of 31,624,924 Ordinary Shares in this offering, and based on a public offering price of $0.68 per share and a net tangible book value per share of $0.62 as of December 31, 2020, without giving effect to the potential exercise of the warrants being offered by this prospectus supplement, if you purchase securities in this offering, you will suffer immediate and substantial dilution of $0.06 per share in the net tangible book value of the Ordinary Shares purchased. See “Dilution” on page S-8 for a more detailed discussion of the dilution you will incur in connection with this offering.\n\n**A large number of shares may be sold in the market following this offering, which may significantly depress the market price of our Ordinary Shares.**\n\nThe Ordinary Shares sold in the offering will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act. As a result, a substantial number of our Ordinary Shares may be sold in the public market following this offering. If there are significantly more Ordinary Shares offered for sale than buyers are willing to purchase, then the market price of our Ordinary Shares may decline to a market price at which buyers are willing to purchase the offered Ordinary Shares and sellers remain willing to sell our Ordinary Shares.\n\nS-5\n\n**The Warrants may be dilutive to holders of our Ordinary Shares.**\n\nThe ownership interest of the existing holders of our Ordinary Shares will be diluted to the extent that the Warrants are exercised. The Ordinary Shares underlying the Warrants represented approximately 13.7% of our Ordinary Shares outstanding as of September 23, 2021 (assuming that the total Ordinary Shares outstanding includes the 31,624,924 Ordinary Shares offered pursuant to this prospectus supplement and the 23,086,195 issuable upon exercise of the Warrants).\n\n**There is no public market for the warrants to purchase our ordinary shares in this offering.**\n\nThere is no established public trading market for the warrants being offered in this offering, and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply to list the warrants on any securities exchange. Without an active market, the liquidity of the warrants will be limited.\n\n**RISKS RELATED TO THE CURRENT PANDEMIC**\n\n**_Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19._**\n\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus causing respiratory illness, or COVID-19, has surfaced in Wuhan, China, spreading at a fast rate in January and February of 2020, and has now developed to be a global pandemic. In reaction to this outbreak, an increasing number of countries imposed travel suspensions to and from China following the World Health Organization’s “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) announcement on January 30, 2020. Since this outbreak, business activities in China and many other countries including U.S. have been disrupted by a series of emergency quarantine measures taken by the government.\n\nAs a result, our operations in China and U.S. have been materially affected. For example, we acquired Sunway Kids in February 2020 with the plan to engage education and health services to day-care and preschools in China, but due to the impact of COVID-19, Sunway Kids was unable to conduct its normal operations. Accordingly, we disposed Sunway Kids in June 2020. New York, where our U.S. operations are based, is currently significantly affected by COVID-19, which led to measures taken by the New York government trying to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as reduction on the number of people in gathering and travel restrictions. Additional travel and other restrictions may be put in place to further control the outbreak in U.S. Accordingly, our operation and business have been and will continue to be adversely affected as the results of the wide-spread pandemic. Management may have to adjust or change our business plan in response to the prolonged pandemic and change of social behavior.\n\nThe extent to which COVID-19 negatively impacts our business is highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We believe that the coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to control it may have a significant negative impact on not only our business, but economic activities globally. The magnitude of this negative effect on the continuity of our business operation remains uncertain. These uncertainties impede our ability to conduct our daily operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result affect our stock price and create more volatility.\n\nS-6\n\n**USE OF PROCEEDS**\n\nWe estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the Shares offered by this prospectus supplement, after deducting the Placement Agent fee and other estimated expenses of this offering payable by us, will be approximately $19.5 million.\n\nAlthough we have not yet determined with certainty the manner in which we will allocate the net proceeds of this offering, we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, and other general corporate purposes, including investments in more sales and marketing in the United States and internationally. The precise amount and timing of the application of these proceeds will depend on our funding requirements and the availability and costs of other funds. Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion over the use of such proceeds.\n\n**DIVIDEND POLICY**\n\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our Ordinary Shares. We anticipate that we will retain any earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business. Therefore, we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and will depend on a number of factors, including future earnings, capital requirements, financial conditions and future prospects and other factors the Board may deem relevant. Payments of dividends to our company are subject to restrictions including primarily the restriction that foreign invested enterprises may only buy, sell and/or remit foreign currencies at those banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business after providing valid commercial documents.\n\n**CAPITALIZATION**\n\nThe following table sets forth our capitalization as of December 31, 2020:\n\n●| on an actual basis;  \n---|---  \n●| on a pro forma basis, as adjusted basis to give effect to the exercise of warrants into 8,330,000 ordinary shares with an average exercise price of $0.55 from January 2021 to March 2021;  \n---|---  \n●| on a pro forma basis, as adjusted basis to give effect to the issuance of 2,160,000 ordinary shares for employee compensation in January 2021;  \n---|---  \n●| on a pro forma basis, as adjusted basis to give effect to the issuance of 1,815,000 ordinary shares in connection with copyrights acquisitions in February 2021;  \n---|---  \n●| on a pro forma basis, as adjusted basis to give effect to the issuance of 20,000,000 ordinary shares in February 2021 for $26.0 million in connection with a private offering;  \n---|---  \n●| on a pro forma basis, as adjusted basis to give effect to the issuance of 1,500,000 ordinary shares for employee compensation in March 2021;  \n---|---  \n●| on a pro forma basis, as adjusted basis to give effect to the issuances of 20,000,000 ordinary shares in March 2021 for $26.0 million in connection with a private placement;  \n---|---  \n●| on a pro forma basis, as adjusted basis to give effect to the issuances of 4,055,000 ordinary shares for employee compensation in August 2021;  \n---|---  \n●| on a pro forma, as adjusted basis to give effect to the sale of 31,624,924 Ordinary Shares at a price per share of $0.68, after deducting placement agent fees and expenses and estimated offering expenses payable by us.  \n---|---  \nDecember 31, 2020  \n---  \nActual | Pro Forma  \nUS$ | US$  \nEquity  \nOrdinary shares, par value $0.001 per share: 200,000,000 shares authorized, 56,551,811 shares issued and outstanding, actual; par value $0.01 per share: 200,000,000 shares authorized, 146,036,553 shares issued and outstanding, pro forma as adjusted (unaudited) | 56,552 | 146,037  \nAdditional paid-in capital | 86,191,477 | 169,841,694  \nDeferred share compensation | (723,375| ) | (723,375| )  \nDeficit | (66,897,346| ) | (73,019,146| )  \nTotal equity | 18,627,308 | 96,245,210  \nTotal capitalization | 18,627,308 | 96,245,210  \n  \nS-7\n\n**DILUTION**\n\nYour ownership interest, as a result of the issuance of the Ordinary Shares in this offering, will be diluted immediately to the extent of the difference between the offering price per Ordinary Shares and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Ordinary Shares after this offering.\n\nOur historical net tangible book value as of December 31, 2020 was $70,556,638 or $0.62 per Ordinary Share. Historical net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets, less total liabilities, divided by the number of our Ordinary Shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020. Our net tangible book value on December 31, 2020 includes consideration of the following issuances:\n\n●| Issuance of 8,330,000 ordinary shares upon exercise of warrants from March 2021 to March 2021;  \n---|---  \n●| Issuance of 2,160,000 ordinary shares for employee compensation in January 2021;  \n---|---  \n●| Issuance of 1,815,000 ordinary shares in connection with copyrights acquisitions in February 2021;  \n---|---  \n●| Issuance of 20,000,000 ordinary shares in February 2021 for $26.0 million in connection with a private offering;  \n---|---  \n●| Issuance of 1,500,000 ordinary shares for employee compensation in March 2021;  \n---|---  \n●| Issuance of 20,000,000 ordinary shares in March 2021 for $26.0 million in connection with a private placement;  \n---|---  \n●| Issuance of 4,055,000 ordinary shares for employee compensation in August 2021;  \n---|---  \n  \nAfter giving effect to the sale by us in this offering of 31,624,924 Ordinary Shares at a price per share of $0.68, after deducting estimated placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma net tangible book value as of December 31, 2020 would have been approximately $146,036,735, or approximately $0.62 per Ordinary Share. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible book value of approximately $0.00 per Ordinary Share to our existing Ordinary Shareholders and an immediate dilution in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value of approximately $0.62 per Ordinary Share to purchasers in this offering, as illustrated by the following table:\n\nPublic offering price per share | $| 0.68  \n---|---|---  \nHistorical net tangible book value per share as of December 31, 2020 | $| 0.62  \nIncrease in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share attributed to the investors purchasing shares issued in this offering | $| 0.00  \nPro forma, as adjusted, net tangible book value per share after giving effect to this offering | $| 0.62  \nDilution to pro forma, as adjusted, net tangible book value per share to new investors purchasing Shares in this offering | $| (0.06| )  \n  \nThe following table summarizes as of December 31, 2020, on a pro forma basis, as described above, the number of our Ordinary Shares, the total consideration and the average price per share (1) paid to us by our existing shareholders and (2) issued to persons in this offering at an offering price of $0.68 per share, before deducting estimated offering expenses payable by us:\n\nOrdinary Shares Purchased | Total Consideration | Average Price  \n---|---|---  \nNumber | Percent | Amount | Percent | Per Share  \nExisting shareholders | 114,411,811 | 78.3| % | 169,987,731 | 88.8| % | $| 1.49  \nNew investors | 31,624,924 | 21.7| % | 21,504,948 | 11.2| % | $| 0.68  \nTotal | 146,036,735 | 100.0| % | $| 191,492,679 | 100.0| % | $| 1.31  \n  \nThe total number of our ordinary shares reflected in the discussion and tables above is based on 56,551,811 Ordinary Shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020 plus issuance of 57,860,000 Ordinary Shares from January to August 2021, and excludes 23,086,195 Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants offered in this offering.\n\nS-8\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF OUR SECURITIES WE ARE OFFERING**\n\n**Ordinary Shares**\n\nA description of our Ordinary Shares we are offering pursuant to this prospectus supplement is set forth under the heading “Description of Share Capital,” starting on page 10 of the accompanying prospectus. As of September 23, 2021, we had 114,411,629 outstanding Ordinary Shares.\n\n**Warrants**\n\n_The material terms and provisions of the warrants being offered pursuant to this prospectus supplement and being issued to the investors and placement agent (with some exceptions noted below) are summarized below. The form of warrant will be provided in this offering and will be filed as an exhibit to a Report of Foreign Issuer on Form 6-K with the SEC in connection with this offering._\n\nThe warrants to be issued to the investors will have an exercise price of $1.00 per Ordinary Share. The warrants are exercisable on or after the date of issuance and will terminate 36 months after the date of issuance. The exercise price and number of Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise is subject to appropriate adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited to, stock dividends or splits, business combination, sale of assets, similar recapitalization transactions, or other similar transactions. In addition, the exercise price of the investor warrants is subject to an adjustment in the event that we issue or are deemed to issue Ordinary Shares for less than the applicable exercise price of the warrant.\n\nThe warrant issuable to the placement agent shall generally be on the same terms and conditions as the investor warrants sold in this offering, except that the placement agent warrants (a) shall not be exercisable for a period of 6 months, (b) shall expire 36 months after the warrants are issued and (c) do not contain antidilution or price protection features other than adjustments in connection with stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar recapitalization transactions.\n\nThere is no established public trading market for the warrants, and we do not expect a market to develop. We do not intend to apply to list the warrants on any securities exchange. Without an active market, the liquidity of the warrants will be limited.\n\nHolders of the warrants may exercise their warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares on or before the termination date by delivering an exercise notice, appropriately completed and duly signed. Following each exercise of the warrants, the holder is required to pay the exercise price for the number of shares for which the warrant is being exercised in cash. A holder of the warrants also will have the right to exercise its warrants on a cashless basis if the registration statement or prospectus contained therein is not available for the issuance of the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise thereof. Warrants may be exercised in whole or in part, and any portion of a warrant not exercised prior to the termination date shall be and become void and of no value. The absence of an effective registration statement or applicable exemption from registration does not alleviate our obligation to deliver Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant.\n\nUpon the holder’s exercise of a warrant, we will issue the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant within two trading days of our receipt of notice of exercise, subject to receipt of payment of the aggregate exercise price therefor.\n\nThe Ordinary Shares issuable on exercise of the warrants are duly and validly authorized and will be, when issued, delivered and paid for in accordance with the warrants, issued and fully paid and non-assessable. We will authorize and reserve at least that number of Ordinary Shares equal to 150% of the number of Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of all outstanding warrants.\n\nS-9\n\nIf, at any time a warrant is outstanding, we consummate any fundamental transaction, as described in the warrants and generally including any consolidation or merger into another corporation, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other transaction in which our Ordinary Shares are converted into or exchanged for other securities or other consideration, the holder of any warrants will thereafter receive, the securities or other consideration to which a holder of the number of Ordinary Shares then deliverable upon the exercise or exchange of such warrants would have been entitled upon such consolidation or merger or other transaction. Additionally, in the event of a BSV fundamental transaction, as described in the warrants, each warrant holder will have the right to require us, or our successor, to repurchase the warrants for an amount equal to the Black-Scholes value of the remaining unexercised portion of the warrant on the terms set forth in the warrant.\n\nThe exercisability of the warrants may be limited in certain circumstances if, after giving effect to such exercise, the holder or any of its affiliates would beneficially own (as determined pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) more than 4.99% or 9.99% (as applicable) of our Ordinary Shares.\n\nIn the event the volume weighted average price per Ordinary Shares exceeds 250% of the initial exercise price of the warrants for ten consecutive trading days, we may be eligible to require the investors to exercise the warrants by delivering an irrevocable notice of our intention to all of the warrant holders. The number of warrants subject to such demand may be limited by the trading volume of our Ordinary Shares during the three Trading Days prior to delivery of a notice to the holders and by the percentages mentioned in the prior paragraph.\n\nTHE HOLDER OF A WARRANT WILL NOT POSSESS ANY RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER UNDER THAT WARRANT UNTIL THE HOLDER EXERCISES THE WARRANT. THE WARRANTS MAY BE TRANSFERRED INDEPENDENT OF THE ORDINARY SHARES WITH WHICH THEY WERE ISSUED, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAWS.\n\n**No Market for Warrants**\n\nThere is no established public trading market for the warrants, and we do not expect a market to develop. We do not intend to apply to list the warrants on any securities exchange. Without an active market, the liquidity of the warrants will be limited. In addition, in the event our Ordinary Shares price does not exceed the per share exercise price of the warrants during the period when the warrants are exercisable, the warrants will not have any value.\n\n**Transfer Agent and Registrar**\n\nThe transfer agent and registrar for the Ordinary Shares is Action Stock Transfer, 2469 E. Fort Union Blvd, Suite 214 Salt Lake City, UT 84121.\n\n**Listing**\n\nOur Ordinary Shares are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “CSCW”.\n\nS-10\n\n**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**\n\n**Placement Agency Agreement and Securities Purchase Agreement**\n\nFT Global Capital, Inc., which we refer to as the placement agent, has agreed to act as the exclusive placement agent in connection with this offering subject to the terms and conditions of a placement agency agreement dated as of September 24, 2021. The offering of the securities offered hereby have been made only by the placement agent, and no other party is authorized to offer the securities offered hereby. The placement agent is not purchasing or selling any securities offered by this prospectus supplement, nor is it required to arrange the purchase or sale of any specific number or dollar amount of securities, but it has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to arrange for the sale of all of the securities offered hereby.\n\nWe will enter into a securities purchase agreement with the purchasers pursuant to which we will sell to the purchasers 31,624,924 Ordinary Shares and warrants to initially purchase up to 22,137,448 Ordinary Shares, at a price of $0.68 per share. We negotiated the price for the securities offered in this offering with the purchasers. The factors considered in determining the price included the recent market price of our Ordinary Shares, the general condition of the securities market at the time of this offering, the history of, and the prospects, for the industry in which we compete, our past and present operations, and our prospects for future revenues.\n\nThe placement agent may be deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, and any fees or commissions received by it and any profit realized on the resale of securities sold by it while acting as principal might be deemed to be underwriting discounts or commissions under the Securities Act. As an underwriter, the placement agent is required to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act and Rule 10b-5 and Regulation M under the Exchange Act. These rules and regulations may limit the timing of purchases and sales of Ordinary Shares and warrants by the placement agent. Under these rules and regulations, the placement agent:\n\n●| may not engage in any stabilization activity in connection with our securities; and  \n---|---  \n●| may not bid for or purchase any of our securities or attempt to induce any person to purchase any of our securities, other than as permitted under the Exchange Act, until it has completed its participation in the distribution.  \n---|---  \n  \nFrom time to time in the common course of their respective businesses, the placement agent or its affiliates have in the past or may in the future engage in investment banking and/or other services with us and our affiliates for which it has or may in the future receive customary fees and expenses.\n\nUnder the securities purchase agreement, we will be precluded from engaging in equity or equity-linked securities offerings for a period of 90 days from closing of the offering, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nIn addition, we also agreed with the purchasers that while the warrants are outstanding, we will not effect or enter into an agreement to effect a “Variable Rate Transaction,” which means a transaction in which we:\n\n●| issue or sell any convertible securities either (A) at a conversion, exercise or exchange rate or other price that is based upon and/or varies with the trading prices of, or quotations for, the shares of our Ordinary Shares at any time after the initial issuance of such convertible securities, or (B) with a conversion, exercise or exchange price that is subject to being reset at some future date after the initial issuance of such convertible securities or upon the occurrence of specified or contingent events directly or indirectly related to our business or the market for our Ordinary Shares, other than pursuant to a customary “weighted average” anti-dilution provision; or  \n---|---  \n●| enter into any agreement (including, without limitation, an “equity line of credit”) whereby we may sell securities at a future determined price (other than standard and customary “preemptive” or “participation” rights).  \n---|---  \n  \nWe agreed with the purchasers that, subject to certain exceptions, if we issue securities within the 12 months following the closing of this offering, the purchasers shall have the right to purchase 35% of the securities on the same terms, conditions and price provided for in the proposed issuance of securities.\n\nWe also agreed to indemnify the purchasers against certain losses resulting from our breach of any of our representations, warranties, or covenants under agreements with the purchasers as well as under certain other circumstances described in the securities purchase agreement.\n\nS-11\n\n**Fees and Expenses**\n\nWe have agreed to pay the placement agent upon the closing of this offering a cash fee equal to 7.0% of the aggregate purchase price of the securities offered under this prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus. In addition, we have agreed to pay additional compensation in the form of warrants to purchase 3.0% of the Ordinary Shares to be sold to the purchasers (or 948,748 Ordinary Shares assuming the maximum offering is completed) at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. Under the placement agent agreement, the placement agent is also entitled to additional tail compensation for any financings consummated within the twelve month period following the closing date of this offering to the extent that such financing is provided to us by investors that the placement agent had introduced to us.\n\nThe warrant issuable to the placement agent shall generally be on the same terms and conditions as the warrants sold in this offering, except that the placement agent warrants shall not be exercisable for a period of six months and shall expire 36 months after the warrants are issued and shall have no anti-dilution protection other than adjustments based on stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar recapitalization transactions. Pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1), with limited exceptions, neither the placement agent warrants nor any of the Ordinary Shares issued upon exercise of the placement agent warrants shall be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or hypothecated, or be the subject of any hedging, short sale, derivative, put, or call transaction that would result in the effective economic disposition of the securities by any person for a period of 180 days immediately following the date commencement of sales in this offering.\n\nBecause there is no minimum offering amount in this offering, the actual total placement agent fees are not presently determinable.\n\nWe are obligated to reimburse the placement agent for expenses incurred by it in connection with the offering, not to exceed $110,000.\n\nWe have agreed to indemnify the placement agent and certain other persons against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We also have agreed to contribute to payments the placement agent may be required to make in respect of such liabilities. We have set aside an additional $250,000 in escrow to fund our indemnification obligations to the placement agent for a period of 12 months following the closing of this offering.\n\nAfter deducting fees due to the placement agent and our estimated offering expenses, we expect the net proceeds from this offering to be approximately $19.5 million assuming completion of the maximum offering.\n\n**Delivery of Ordinary Shares and Warrants**\n\nDelivery of our Ordinary Shares and warrants issued and sold in this offering will occur on or before September 28, 2021.\n\n**LEGAL MATTERS**\n\nCertain legal matters relating to the offering of Ordinary Shares under this prospectus supplement will be passed upon for us by Conyers Dill & Pearman LLP with respect to matters of Cayman Islands law and by Kaufman & Canoles, P.C., Richmond, Virginia, with respect to matters of U.S. law. Certain legal matters in connection with this offering will be passed upon for the placement agent by Sheppard Mulllin Richter & Hampton LLP with respect to U.S. law.\n\n**EXPERTS**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of our Company for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 appearing in our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 have been audited by Wei, Wei & Co.

We are registered in the Cayman Islands because of certain benefits associated with being a Cayman Islands exempted company, such as political and economic stability, an effective judicial system, a favorable tax system, the absence of foreign exchange control or currency restrictions and the availability of professional and support services. However, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of securities laws that provide significantly less protection to investors as compared to the securities laws of the United States. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the United States.\n\nAll of our assets are located in China. In addition, some of our directors and officers are residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our directors and officers, or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\n\nAccording to Conyers Dill & Pearman LLP, our local Cayman Islands’ counsel, there is uncertainty with regard to Cayman Islands law relating to whether a judgment obtained from the United States or Hong Kong courts under civil liability provisions of the securities laws will be determined by the courts of the Cayman Islands as penal or punitive in nature. If such a determination is made, the courts of the Cayman Islands will not recognize or enforce the judgment against a Cayman Islands’ company. The courts of the Cayman Islands in the past determined that disgorgement proceedings brought at the instance of the Securities and Exchange Commission are penal or punitive in nature and such judgments would not be enforceable in the Cayman Islands. Other civil liability provisions of the securities laws may be characterized as remedial, and therefore enforceable but the Cayman Islands’ Courts have not yet ruled in this regard. Our Cayman Islands’ counsel has further advised us that a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of the United States under which a sum of money is payable other than a sum payable in respect of taxes, fines, penalties or similar charges, may be subject to enforcement proceedings as a debt in the courts of the Cayman Islands.\n\nIf any person in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects, or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that another person is engaged in criminal conduct or money laundering, or is involved with terrorism or terrorist financing and property, and the information for that knowledge or suspicion came to their attention in the course of business in the regulated sector, or other trade, profession, business or employment, the person will be required to report such knowledge or suspicion to (i) the Financial Reporting Authority of the Cayman Islands (“FRA”), pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, if the disclosure relates to criminal conduct or money laundering, or (ii) a police officer of the rank of constable or higher, or the FRA, pursuant to the Terrorism Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, if the disclosure relates to involvement with terrorism or terrorist financing and property.\n\nAs of the date hereof, no treaty or other form of reciprocity exists between the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong governing the recognition and enforcement of judgments.\n\nCayman Islands’ counsel further advised that although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States or Hong Kong, a judgment obtained in such jurisdictions will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment (1) is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction, (2) imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given, (3) is final, (4) is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty, and (5) was not obtained in a manner and is of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands.\n\n**DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS**\n\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our M&A requires us to indemnify our officers and directors for actions, proceedings, claims, losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (“Indemnified Losses”) incurred in their capacities as such unless such Indemnified Losses arise from dishonesty of such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.\n\nS-14\n\n**The information in this prospectus is not complete and may be changed. We may not sell these securities until the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is effective. This prospectus is not an offer to sell these securities and it is not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any state where the offer or sale is not permitted.**\n\n**PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS** | **SUBJECT TO COMPLETION** | **DATED AUGUST 18, 2021**  \n---|---|---  \n  \n![](image_003.jpg)\n\n**Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.**\n\n**22,892,037 Ordinary Shares**\n\nThis prospectus relates to the offer and resale of up to an aggregate of 22,892,037 ordinary shares (the “Shares”) of Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.

(formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.) was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C-corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, we changed our name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc.\n\nOn August 20, 2018, CACM was incorporated in the State of New York and is wholly owned by us. The establishment of CACM was to expand the Company’s business in the U.S. CACM has not commenced operations. \n\nOn December 27, 2018, we consummated a re-domicile merger pursuant to which we merged with and into China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Cayman Islands company and the surviving entity in the merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger adopted in July 2018. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company is now governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nOn July 16, 2019, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of the Company’s memorandum and articles of association which was approved by the Company’s shareholders, the Company’s name was changed from China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. to Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”) and its shareholders. On February 14, 2020, the Company consummated the acquisition of Sunway Kids whereby we issued 1,989,262 ordinary shares and $2 million of cash to be paid in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sunway Kids. The $2 million cash consideration is payable in five installments over five years according to an earn-out schedule. Sunway Kids thereby became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Prior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, our core business was the concrete business in China. Through Sunway Kids and its variable interest entity, we were engaged in providing education and health services to day-care and preschools in China.\n\nOn March 10, 2020, CACM entered into a certain joint venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Baydolphin, Inc., a company organized under the laws of New York (“Baydolphin”). Pursuant to the JV Agreement, CACM and Baydolphin have established a limited liability company under the laws of New York, Baytao LLC (“Baytao”), which planned to be the 100% owner of one or more operating entities in the U.S. to engage in the business of online and offline after-school education.\n\nOn May 1, 2020, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of its memorandum and articles of association (which was approved by the Company’s shareholders), the Company’s name was changed from Huitao Technology Co., Ltd. to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company completed the disposition (the “Disposition”) of its former subsidiary, Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (“BVI-ACM”), after obtaining its shareholders’ approval on April 27, 2020 and satisfaction or waiver of all other closing conditions. Upon the closing of the Disposition, Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He became the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. Through the Deposition, the Company exited the concrete business.\n\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”), a Hong Kong limited company, and shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company will acquire all of the outstanding issued shares and other equity interests in Color China from the sellers (the “Acquisition”). On June 3, 2020, the transaction contemplated by the Exchange Agreement was consummated when the Company issued 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company to the Sellers and the Sellers transferred all of Color China’s issued and outstanding shares to the Company. Immediately after the Acquisition, Color Star owns 100% of Color China. Headquartered in Hong Kong, China, Color China is an emerging performance equipment and music education provider with a significant collection of performance specific assets and unique experience in working with many renowned artists.\n\n2\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the Company and the former shareholders of Sunway Kids entered into an Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment”) to the Share Exchange Agreement dated December 31, 2019, as amended. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company shall not make any Earn-out Payment to the former shareholders of Sunway Kids since Sunway Kids has been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and management of Sunway Kids believes it will be very difficult to achieve its projected financial results. On the same day, Sunway Kids and Yanliang Han (the “Purchaser”), an unrelated third party, entered into certain share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Disposition SPA on June 25, 2020, the Purchaser became the sole shareholder of Sunway Kids and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by Sunway Kids. By disposing Sunway Kids, the Company exited the preschool children online education service.\n\nEffective October 1, 2020, the Company changed the ticker symbol of its Ordinary Shares traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market from “HHT” to “CSCW”, representing the abbreviation of “Color Star Color World.” Our online platform Color World is the new focus of our business.\n\nOn June 18, 2021, Modern Pleasure International Limited, a limited liability company, was incorporated in Hong Kong and is wholly owned by us. Modern Pleasure International Limited has not commenced operations.\n\nOn June 29, 2021, CACM entered into a share purchase agreement with Baydolphin. Pursuant to the agreement, CACM agreed to sell, and Baydolphin agreed to purchase 80% of the outstanding equity interest of Baytao for a consideration of $100. Prior to the sale, Baytao had no operation or asset. Upon completion of the sale, Baytao ceased to be a subsidiary of the Company.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nWe are an entertainment and education company providing online and offline innovative music education through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Color China.

At present, we have signed contracts with well-known international artists and more than 50 celebrity teachers have been retained to launch online lectures. The Color World App not only has celebrity lectures, but also celebrity concert videos, celebrity peripheral products, such as celebrity branded merchandise, and artist interactive communication. With the Chinese version and the English version, the Color World App has attracted worldwide users. We strive to build an all-star cultural and entertainment industry chain. To establish a new entertainment industry chain combining online and offline, we also plan to establish offline education institutions. The offline education base will train during the day and perform at night to make the training base a commercial operation. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our plan to establish the offline education base has been delayed. The management of the Company will adjust our plan of development in accordance with the development of COVID-19.\n\nThe management believes that we, along with our alliance, have strong industry resources and influence to become a comprehensive online academy for global “future stars”.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates our current corporate structure:\n\n![](image_002.jpg)\n\n**Corporate Information**\n\nOur principal executive office is located on 7 World Trade Center, Suite 4621, New York, NY 10007.

All of the Shares, when sold, will be sold by the Selling Shareholders. The Selling Shareholders may sell the Shares from time to time at prevailing market prices or at privately negotiated prices.\n\nOrdinary Shares Offered by the Selling Shareholders: | 22,892,037 Ordinary Shares.  \n---|---  \nOrdinary Shares Outstanding at August 16, 2021: | 114,411,629 Ordinary Shares.  \nUse of Proceeds: | We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Shares offered by this prospectus by the Selling Shareholders.  \nRisk Factors: | An investment in the Shares offered under this prospectus is highly speculative and involves substantial risk.

Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also impair our business and operations.  \nNasdaq Symbol: | CSCW  \n  \n5\n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\nBefore you make a decision to invest in our securities, you should consider carefully the risks described below. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations and could result in a complete loss of your investment.\n\nYou should also carefully consider the risk factors set forth under “Risk Factors” described in our most recent annual report on Form 20-F, filed on November 13, 2020 and amended on February 26, 2021, and all other information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement and in any related free writing prospectus in connection with a specific offering, before making an investment decision. Each of the risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects, as well as the value of an investment in our securities, and the occurrence of any of these risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment. \n\n**Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Ordinary Shares**\n\n**_If we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, we would face possible delisting, which would result in a limited public market for our shares and make obtaining future debt or equity financing more difficult for us._**\n\nOn November 18, 2019, we received a notification letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Stockholder Equity Requirement”). The notification received had no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Nasdaq has provided us with 45 calendar days, or until January 2, 2020, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity standard. If our plan to regain compliance is accepted, Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notification letter, or until May 16, 2019, to evidence compliance. On January 2, 2020, we submitted our plan of compliance to Nasdaq.\n\nOn January 24, 2020, we received a notice (the “Notice”) from Nasdaq stating that we were not able to regain compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement or the alternative criteria set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b) and that the Staff had determined to seek to delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq unless the Company requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). On January 28, 2020 we requested a hearing before the Panel. Such stays any suspension or delisting action by Nasdaq pending the completion of the hearing process. On January 30, 2020, we received a hearing instruction letter from Nasdaq stating that the delisting action referenced in the Notice has been stayed, pending a final written decision by the Panel.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, the Company appeared before the Panel to demonstrate its ability to regain compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement and subsequently submitted supplemental information to the Panel on March 23, 2020 pursuant to the Panel’s request. By a letter dated April 16, 2020, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that the Panel had determined to continue the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares based upon the Company’s compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement. Additionally, the Panel advised in such letter that is has placed the Company under a Panel Monitor (the “Monitor”) that shall last through April 15, 2021. Pursuant to that Monitor and as provided in the Nasdaq Rules, if at any time during the monitor period the Company fails to maintain compliance with any listing standard, Nasdaq will issue a Staff Delisting Determination and the Hearings Department will promptly schedule a new hearing.\n\nSeparately, on March 5, 2020, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Requirement”). The notification received has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company had until September 1, 2020 to regain compliance. If at any time during such 180-day period the closing bid price of the Company’s ordinary shares is at least $1 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company written confirmation of compliance.\n\n6\n\nOn August 10, 2020, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2), as the Company maintained a closing bid price of $1.00 per share or greater for twenty (20) consecutive days from July 13, 2020 through August 7, 2020. On October 18, 2020, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the Bid Price Requirement again and were granted 180 days or until April 13, 2021 to regain compliance. On April 12, 2021, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2). On April 19, 2021, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that its Panel has determined to continue the listing of the Company’s securities on Nasdaq.\n\nNasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain the compliance with the Nasdaq rules. If we fail to comply with the Bid Price Requirement or any other listing rules when required in the future, we could be subject to suspension and delisting proceedings. If our securities lose their status on The NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities would likely trade in the over-the-counter market. If our securities were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our securities could be more difficult because smaller quantities of securities would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts’ coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event our securities are delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, further limiting the liquidity of our securities. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities. Such delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market and continued or further declines in our share price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions. \n\n**_The price of our ordinary shares historically has been volatile, which may affect the price at which you could sell the ordinary shares._**\n\nOur ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CSCW.” The market price for the ordinary shares has varied between a high bid price of $2.67 on March 30, 2021 and a low bid price of $0.36 on September 24, 2020 in the 12-month period ended on August 16, 2021. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell the ordinary shares. The ordinary share price are likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the following:\n\n● | variations in our revenues, earnings and cash flows;  \n---|---  \n● | announcements of new investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors;  \n● | announcements of new offerings, solutions and expansions by us or our competitors;  \n● | changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;  \n● | detrimental adverse publicity about us, our services or our industry;  \n● | announcements of new regulations, rules or policies relevant for our business;  \n● | additions or departures of key personnel;  \n● | release of lockup or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding equity securities or sales of additional equity securities; and  \n● | potential litigation or regulatory investigations.  \n  \nAny of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our ordinary shares will trade.\n\nIn the past, shareholders of public companies have often brought securities class action suits against those companies following periods of instability in the market price of their securities. If we were to be involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management’s attention and other resources from our business and operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit, which could harm our results of operations. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n**_We do not intend to pay dividends on our ordinary shares for the foreseeable future, but if we intend to do so our holding company structure may limit the payment of dividends to our stockholders._**\n\nWhile we have no current intention of paying dividends, should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including as a result of restrictive covenants in loan agreements, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions as discussed below. If future dividends are paid in Hong Kong dollar (“HKD”), fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of HKD into U.S. dollars may reduce the amount received by U.S. stockholders upon conversion of the dividend payment into U.S. dollars.\n\n7\n\n**_We may be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling our ordinary shares._**\n\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called “penny stocks” to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. If our ordinary shares becomes a “penny stock”, we may become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the “Penny Stock Rule”. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market.\n\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our ordinary shares will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our ordinary shares were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\n\n**_If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding the ordinary shares, the market price for the ordinary shares and trading volume could decline._**\n\nThe trading market for our ordinary shares will be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business. If industry or securities analysts decide to cover us and in the future downgrade our ordinary shares, the market price for our ordinary shares would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price or trading volume for our ordinary shares to decline.\n\n**_Techniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of our ordinary shares._**\n\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller’s interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a security short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market.\n\nPublic companies that have substantially all of their operations in the PRC have been the subject of short selling. Much of the scrutiny and negative publicity has centered on allegations of a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting resulting in financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result, many of these companies are now conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations and, in the interim, are subject to shareholder lawsuits and/or SEC enforcement actions.\n\nIt is not clear what effect such negative publicity could have on us. If we were to become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we could have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. While we would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller by principles of freedom of speech, applicable law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation could be costly and time-consuming, and could distract our management from growing our business. Even if such allegations are ultimately proven to be groundless, allegations against us could severely impact our business operations, and any investment in our ordinary shares could be greatly reduced or even rendered worthless.\n\n8\n\n**_We are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to U.S. domestic public companies._**\n\nBecause we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and regulations in the United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including:\n\n● | the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K;  \n---|---  \n● | the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act;  \n---|---  \n● | the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and  \n---|---  \n● | the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe are required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we intend to publish our results on a quarterly basis as press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Press releases relating to financial results and material events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information that would be made available to you were you investing in a U.S. domestic issuer.\n\n**_Because we are a foreign private issuer and are exempt from certain Nasdaq corporate governance standards applicable to U.S. issuers, you will have less protection than you would have if we were a domestic issuer._**\n\nNasdaq Listing Rules require listed companies to have, among other things, a majority of its board members be independent. As a foreign private issuer, however, we are permitted to, and we may, follow home country practice in lieu of the above requirements, or we may choose to comply with the Nasdaq requirement within one year of listing. The corporate governance practice in our home country, the Cayman Islands, does not require a majority of our board to consist of independent directors. Since a majority of our board of directors will not consist of independent directors, fewer board members will be exercising independent judgment and the level of board oversight on the management of our company may decrease as a result. In addition, the Nasdaq listing rules also require U.S. domestic issuers to have a compensation committee, a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors, and an audit committee with a minimum of three members. We, as a foreign private issuer, are not subject to these requirements. The Nasdaq listing rules may require shareholder approval for certain corporate matters, such as requiring that shareholders be given the opportunity to vote on all equity compensation plans and material revisions to those plans, certain ordinary share issuances. We intend to comply with the requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rules in determining whether shareholder approval is required on such matters and to appoint a nominating and corporate governance committee. However, we may consider following home country practice in lieu of the requirements under Nasdaq listing rules with respect to certain corporate governance standards which may afford less protection to investors.\n\n**_While we have spun off all of our Chinese subsidiaries as of June 30, 2020, adverse regulatory developments in China may subject us to additional regulatory review and expose us to government interference, and additional disclosure requirements and regulatory scrutiny to be adopted by the SEC in response to risks related to recent regulatory developments in China may impose additional compliance requirements for companies like us with significant China-based operations, all of which could increase our compliance costs, subject us to additional disclosure requirements, and/or suspend or terminate our future securities offerings, making capital-raising more difficult._**\n\nWhile our operating entity Color China is based in Hong Kong, not mainland China, the recent regulatory developments in China, in particular with respect to restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore, may lead to additional regulatory review in China over our financing and capital raising activities in the United States. In addition, we may become subject to industry-wide regulations that may be adopted by the relevant PRC authorities, which may have the effect of limiting our service offerings, restricting the scope of our operations in China, or causing the suspension or termination of our business operations in China entirely, all of which will materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may have to adjust, modify, or completely change our business operations in response to adverse regulatory changes or policy developments, and we cannot assure you that any remedial action adopted by us can be completed in a timely, cost-efficient, or liability-free manner or at all.\n\n9\n\nOn July 30, 2021, in response to the recent regulatory developments in China and actions adopted by the PRC government, the Chairman of the SEC issued a statement asking the SEC staff to seek additional disclosures from offshore issuers associated with China-based operating companies before their registration statements will be declared effective, including detailed disclosure related to VIE structures and whether the VIE and the issuer, when applicable, received or were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges and the risks that such approval could be denied or rescinded. On August 1, 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission stated in a statement that it had taken note of the new disclosure requirements announced by the SEC regarding the listings of Chinese companies and the recent regulatory development in China, and that both countries should strengthen communications on regulating China-related issuers. While we do not maintain a VIE structure and we have spun off all Chinese subsidiaries as of June 30, 2020, we might be subject to a variety of PRC laws because we have business activities in China from time to time. We cannot guarantee that we will not be subject to tightened regulatory review and exposed to government interference in China. In light of the recent regulatory and policy developments in China and government actions taken by the PRC government, including possible imposition of restrictions and/or approval requirements on China-based companies raising capital offshore, the offering of our securities may be subject to additional disclosure requirements and review that the SEC or other regulatory authorities in the United States may adopt for companies with China-based operations.\n\n**Risks Related to the Current Pandemic**\n\n**_Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19._**\n\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus causing respiratory illness, or COVID-19, has surfaced in Wuhan, China, spreading at a fast rate in January and February of 2020, and has now developed to be a global pandemic. In reaction to this outbreak, an increasing number of countries imposed travel suspensions to and from China following the World Health Organization’s “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) announcement on January 30, 2020. Since this outbreak, business activities in China and many other countries including U.S. have been disrupted by a series of emergency quarantine measures taken by the government.\n\nAs a result, our operations in China and U.S. have been materially affected. For example, we acquired Sunway Kids in February 2020 with the plan to engage education and health services to day-care and preschools in China, but due to the impact of COVID-19, Sunway Kids was unable to conduct its normal operations. Accordingly, we disposed Sunway Kids in June 2020. New York, where our U.S. operations are based, is currently significantly affected by COVID-19, which led to measures taken by the New York government trying to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as reduction on the number of people in gathering and travel restrictions. Additional travel and other restrictions may be put in place to further control the outbreak in U.S. Accordingly, our operation and business have been and will continue to be adversely affected as the results of the wide-spread pandemic. Management may have to adjust or change our business plan in response to the prolonged pandemic and change of social behavior.\n\nThe extent to which COVID-19 negatively impacts our business is highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We believe that the coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to control it may have a significant negative impact on not only our business, but economic activities globally. The magnitude of this negative effect on the continuity of our business operation remains uncertain. These uncertainties impede our ability to conduct our daily operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result affect our stock price and create more volatility.\n\n**Risks Related to the Cayman Islands Law**\n\n**_Economic substance legislation of the Cayman Islands may adversely impact us or our operations._**\n\nThe Cayman Islands has recently enacted the International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Act (2021 Revision), or the Cayman Economic Substance Act. The Company is required to comply with the Cayman Economic Substance Act. As the Company is a Cayman Islands company, compliance obligations include filing annual notifications for the Company, which need to state whether the Company is carrying out any relevant activities and if so, whether the Company has satisfied economic substance tests to the extent required under the Cayman Economic Substance Act. As it is a new regime, it is anticipated that the Cayman Economic Substance Act will evolve and be subject to further clarification and amendments. The Company may need to allocate additional resources to keep updated with these developments, and may have to make changes to our operations in order to comply with all requirements under the Cayman Economic Substance Act. Failure to satisfy these requirements may subject the Company to penalties under the Cayman Economic Substance Act.\n\n**_We are not clear about the ramifications of the Financial Action Task Force’s increased monitoring of the Cayman Islands for us._**\n\nIn February 2021, the Cayman Islands was added to the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) list of jurisdictions whose anti-money laundering practices are under increased monitoring, commonly referred to as the “FATF grey list.” When the FATF places a jurisdiction under increased monitoring, it means the country has committed to resolve swiftly the identified strategic deficiencies within agreed timeframes and is subject to increased monitoring during that timeframe. It is unclear how long this designation will remain in place and what ramifications, if any, the designation will have for the Company.\n\n10\n\n**PRIVATE PLACEMENTS**\n\nOn June 28, 2021, we closed a private placement of 3,000,000 Ordinary Shares, at a purchase price of $1.30 per share for an aggregate offering price of $3,900,000 (the “First Private Placement”).

The Sixth Private Placement was conducted pursuant to a securities purchase agreement (“Sixth Purchase Agreement;” collectively with the First Purchase Agreement, the Second Purchase Agreement, the Third Purchase Agreement, the Fourth Purchase Agreement, and the Fifth Purchase Agreement, the “Purchase Agreements”), dated March 27, 2021, by and between us and Ahmed Muhammad Abrar.\n\nThe Private Placements were completed pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n\n11\n\n**SELLING SHAREHOLDERS**\n\nThe Shares being offered by the Selling Shareholders include the shares issued to the Selling Shareholders and the share purchased from the Selling Shareholders from other shareholders of the Company. For additional information regarding the issuance of these securities, see “Private Placements” on page 11 of this prospectus. We are registering the Shares in order to permit the Selling Shareholders to offer such shares for resale from time to time. Except for the ownership of the Shares, the transactions contemplated pursuant to the Purchase Agreements, and as disclosed in this section under “Material Relationships with Selling Shareholders”, none of the Selling Shareholders have had any material relationship with us within the past three years.\n\nThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to each Selling Shareholder, including (i) the Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by the Selling Shareholder prior to this offering, (ii) the number of Shares being offered by the Selling Shareholder pursuant to this prospectus and (iii) the Selling Shareholders’ beneficial ownership after completion of this offering. The registration of the Shares issuable to the Selling Shareholders does not necessarily mean that the Selling Shareholders will sell all or any of such shares, but the number of Ordinary Shares and percentages set forth in the final two columns below assume that all Shares being offered by the Selling Shareholders are sold. See “Plan of Distribution.”\n\nThe table is based on information supplied to us by the Selling Shareholders, with beneficial ownership and percentage ownership determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, and includes voting or investment power with respect to Ordinary Shares. This information does not necessarily indicate beneficial ownership for any other purpose.\n\nThis prospectus covers the resale of up to an aggregate of 22,892,037 Shares that may be sold or otherwise disposed of by the Selling Shareholders. See “Private Placements” in this prospectus for further details relating to the Shares.\n\n**Number of Ordinary Shares Owned Prior to Offering(1)** | Maximum Number of Ordinary Shares to be Sold Pursuant to this Prospectus | **Number of Ordinary Shares Owned After Offering(2)** | **Percentage Beneficially Owned After Offering(2)**  \n---|---|---|---  \nYihan Lin | 3,500,000 | 3,500,000 | 0 |  *  \nMinye Wang | 3,000,000 | 3,000,000 | 0 | *  \nAhmed Muhammad Abrar | 3,500,000 | 3,500,000 | 0 | *  \nLi Yan | 3,500,000 | 3,500,000 | 0 | *  \nUllah Sabar | 3,500,000 | 3,500,000 | 0 | *  \nZubair Ahsan | 3,000,000 | 3,000,000 | 0 | *  \nLu Jian(3) | 1,000,000 | 1,000,000 | 0 | *  \nShuwen Wang(4) | 1,100,000 | 1,100,000 | 0 |  *  \nDawei Chen | 300,000 | 300,000 | 0 | *  \nJianling Chen(5) | 492,037 | 492,037 | 0 | *  \nTOTAL | 22,892,037 | 22,892,037 | 0 | * | %  \n*Less| than 1%  \n---|---  \n(1) | Based on information obtained from the Selling Shareholders.  \n---|---  \n(2) |  The number of shares owned and the percentage of beneficial ownership after this offering set forth in these columns are based on 114,411,629 Ordinary Shares outstanding on August 17, 2021.  \n(3) |  Lu Jian purchased 1,000,000 restricted Ordinary Shares from another shareholder on January 21, 2021.

We will not receive any proceeds from these sales. The Selling Shareholders will pay any agent’s commissions and expenses they incur for brokerage, accounting, tax or legal services or any other expenses that they incur in disposing of the Shares. We will bear all other costs, fees and expenses incurred in effecting the registration of the Shares covered by this prospectus and any prospectus supplement. These may include, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, SEC filing fees and expenses of compliance with state securities or “blue sky” laws.\n\nSee “Plan of Distribution” elsewhere in this prospectus for more information.\n\n**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**\n\nThe Selling Shareholders and any of their respective pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their securities covered hereby on any trading market, stock exchange or other trading facility on which the securities are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. The Selling Shareholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling securities:\n\n● | ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  \n---|---  \n● | block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the securities as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  \n● | purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;  \n● | an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;  \n● | privately negotiated transactions;  \n● | settlement of short sales;  \n● | in transactions through broker-dealers that agree with the Selling Shareholders to sell a specified number of such securities at a stipulated price per security;  \n● | through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;  \n● | a combination of any such methods of sale; or  \n● | any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.  \n  \nThe Selling Shareholders may also sell securities under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus.\n\n13\n\nBroker-dealers engaged by the Selling Shareholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling Shareholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of securities, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with FINRA IM-2440.\n\nIn connection with the sale of the securities covered hereby, the Selling Shareholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the securities in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The Selling Shareholders may also sell securities short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the securities to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The Selling Shareholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or create one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of securities offered by this prospectus, which securities such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction).\n\nThe Selling Shareholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the securities may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the securities purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. We are requesting that each Selling Stockholder inform us that it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the securities. We will pay certain fees and expenses incurred by us incident to the registration of the securities.\n\nBecause the Selling Shareholders may be deemed to be an “underwriter” within the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act, including Rule 172 thereunder. In addition, any securities covered by this prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus. We are requesting that each Selling Stockholder confirm that there is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale securities by the Selling Stockholder.\n\nWe intend to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the securities may be resold by the Selling Shareholders without registration and without regard to any volume or manner-of-sale limitations by reason of Rule 144, without the requirement for us to be in compliance with the current public information requirement under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the securities have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. The resale securities will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale securities covered hereby may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with.\n\nUnder applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale securities may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the Common Stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the Selling Shareholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of the Common Stock by the Selling Shareholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the Selling Shareholders and are informing the Selling Shareholders of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act).\n\n**LEGAL MATTERS**\n\nExcept as otherwise set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement, certain legal matters in connection with the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus will be passed upon for us by Kaufman & Canoles, P.C. to the extent governed by the laws of the United States, and by Conyers Dill & Pearman LLP to the extent governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands. If legal matters in connection with offerings made pursuant to this prospectus are passed upon by counsel to underwriters, dealers or agents, such counsel will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to any such offering.\n\n**EXPERTS**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in this prospectus for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 have been audited by Wei, Wei & Co., LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as set forth in their report thereon and incorporated herein by reference, and are included in reliance upon such report given on the authority of such firm as experts in accounting and auditing.\n\n14\n\n**FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\nThe financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 are included in our Annual Report on Form 20-F, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus.\n\n**INFORMATION INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE**\n\nThe SEC allows us to “incorporate by reference” into this prospectus the information we file with the SEC. This means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you to those documents. Any statement contained in a document incorporated by reference in this prospectus shall be deemed to be modified or superseded for purposes of this prospectus to the extent that a statement contained herein, or in any subsequently filed document, which also is incorporated by reference herein, modifies or supersedes such earlier statement.

Since this prospectus may not contain all of the information that you may find important, you should review the full text of these documents. If we have filed a contract, agreement or other document as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, you should read the exhibit for a more complete understanding of the document or matter involved. Each statement in this prospectus, including statements incorporated by reference as discussed above, regarding a contract, agreement or other document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual document.\n\nWe are subject to the information reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that are applicable to foreign private issuers, and, in accordance with these requirements, we file annual and current reports and other information with the SEC. You may inspect, read (without charge) and copy the reports and other information we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an internet website at  _www.sec.gov_ that contains our filed reports and other information that we file electronically with the SEC.\n\nWe maintain a corporate website at https://colorstarinternational.com/. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute a part of this prospectus.\n\n**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**\n\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability. We incorporated in the Cayman Islands because of certain benefits associated with being a Cayman Islands exempted company, such as political and economic stability, an effective judicial system, a favorable tax system, the absence of foreign exchange control or currency restrictions and the availability of professional and support services. However, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of securities laws that provide significantly less protection to investors as compared to the securities laws of the United States. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the United States.\n\nAll of our assets are located in China. In addition, some of our directors and officers are residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our directors and officers, or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\n\nAccording to our local Cayman Islands’ counsel, there is uncertainty with regard to Cayman Islands law relating to whether a judgment obtained from the United States or Hong Kong courts under civil liability provisions of the securities laws will be determined by the courts of the Cayman Islands as penal or punitive in nature. If such a determination is made, the courts of the Cayman Islands will not recognize or enforce the judgment against a Cayman Islands’ company. The courts of the Cayman Islands in the past determined that disgorgement proceedings brought at the instance of the Securities and Exchange Commission are penal or punitive in nature and such judgments would not be enforceable in the Cayman Islands. Other civil liability provisions of the securities laws may be characterized as remedial, and therefore enforceable but the Cayman Islands’ Courts have not yet ruled in this regard. Our Cayman Islands’ counsel has further advised us that a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of the United States under which a sum of money is payable other than a sum payable in respect of taxes, fines, penalties or similar charges, may be subject to enforcement proceedings as a debt in the courts of the Cayman Islands.\n\n16\n\nAs of the date hereof, no treaty or other form of reciprocity exists between the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong governing the recognition and enforcement of judgments.\n\nCayman Islands’ counsel further advised that although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States or Hong Kong, a judgment obtained in such jurisdictions will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment (1) is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction, (2) imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given, (3) is final, (4) is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty, and (5) was not obtained in a manner and is of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands.\n\n**INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES**\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.\n\n17\n"

Each unit consists of one ordinary share and one warrant to purchase 0.7 ordinary share. The purchase price per unit is $0.68. The gross proceeds from the sale of the securities, before deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, will be approximately $21.5 million. The Company will issue to the investors an aggregate of 31,624,924 ordinary shares and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 22,137,448 ordinary shares. The Company will also issue a warrant to purchase 948,747 ordinary shares to the placement agent. The investor warrants and placement agent warrants are initially exercisable at $1.00 per share.\n\nThe net proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate and working capital purposes. The completion of the placement is expected to occur on or about September 28, 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\n\nThe securities described above are being offering by the Company pursuant to a registration statement on Form F-3 (File No. 333-236616) that was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and declared effective on March 10, 2020.\n\nThe forms of the Investor Warrant, the Placement Agent Warrant, the SPA and the Placement Agency Agreement are filed as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2, 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 6-K and such document is incorporated herein by reference.

This prospectus, any prospectus supplement or amendments thereto do not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to purchase, the Shares offered by this prospectus, any prospectus supplement or amendments thereto in any jurisdiction to or from any person to whom or from whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation of an offer in such jurisdiction. You should not assume that the information contained in this prospectus, any prospectus supplement or amendments thereto, as well as information we have previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), is accurate as of any date other than the date on the front cover of the applicable document.\n\nThis prospectus does not constitute a public offer of the common shares, whether by way of sale or subscription, in the Cayman Islands. The common shares have not been offered or sold, and will not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, in the Cayman Islands.\n\nIf necessary, the specific manner in which the Shares may be offered and sold will be described in a supplement to this prospectus, which supplement may also add, update or change any of the information contained in this prospectus.

Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n1\n\n**OUR BUSINESS**\n\n**History and Development of the Company**\n\nWe are an entertainment and education company which provides online entertainment performances and online music education services via our wholly-owned subsidiary, Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”), a Hong Kong company.\n\nColor Star Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.) was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C-corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, we changed our name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc.\n\nOn August 20, 2018, CACM was incorporated in the State of New York and is wholly owned by us. The establishment of CACM was to expand the Company’s business in the U.S. CACM has not commenced operations. \n\nOn December 27, 2018, we consummated a re-domicile merger pursuant to which we merged with and into China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Cayman Islands company and the surviving entity in the merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger adopted in July 2018. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company is now governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nOn July 16, 2019, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of the Company’s memorandum and articles of association which was approved by the Company’s shareholders, the Company’s name was changed from China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. to Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”) and its shareholders. On February 14, 2020, the Company consummated the acquisition of Sunway Kids whereby we issued 1,989,262 ordinary shares and $2 million of cash to be paid in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sunway Kids. The $2 million cash consideration is payable in five installments over five years according to an earn-out schedule. Sunway Kids thereby became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Prior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, our core business was the concrete business in China. Through Sunway Kids and its variable interest entity, we were engaged in providing education and health services to day-care and preschools in China.\n\nOn March 10, 2020, CACM entered into a certain joint venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Baydolphin, Inc., a company organized under the laws of New York (“Baydolphin”). Pursuant to the JV Agreement, CACM and Baydolphin have established a limited liability company under the laws of New York, Baytao LLC (“Baytao”), which planned to be the 100% owner of one or more operating entities in the U.S. to engage in the business of online and offline after-school education.\n\nOn May 1, 2020, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of its memorandum and articles of association (which was approved by the Company’s shareholders), the Company’s name was changed from Huitao Technology Co., Ltd. to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company completed the disposition (the “Disposition”) of its former subsidiary, Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (“BVI-ACM”), after obtaining its shareholders’ approval on April 27, 2020 and satisfaction or waiver of all other closing conditions. Upon the closing of the Disposition, Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He became the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. Through the Deposition, the Company exited the concrete business.\n\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”), a Hong Kong limited company, and shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company will acquire all of the outstanding issued shares and other equity interests in Color China from the sellers (the “Acquisition”). On June 3, 2020, the transaction contemplated by the Exchange Agreement was consummated when the Company issued 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company to the Sellers and the Sellers transferred all of Color China’s issued and outstanding shares to the Company. Immediately after the Acquisition, Color Star owns 100% of Color China. Headquartered in Hong Kong, China, Color China is an emerging performance equipment and music education provider with a significant collection of performance specific assets and unique experience in working with many renowned artists.\n\n2\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the Company and the former shareholders of Sunway Kids entered into an Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment”) to the Share Exchange Agreement dated December 31, 2019, as amended. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company shall not make any Earn-out Payment to the former shareholders of Sunway Kids since Sunway Kids has been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and management of Sunway Kids believes it will be very difficult to achieve its projected financial results. On the same day, Sunway Kids and Yanliang Han (the “Purchaser”), an unrelated third party, entered into certain share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Disposition SPA on June 25, 2020, the Purchaser became the sole shareholder of Sunway Kids and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by Sunway Kids. By disposing Sunway Kids, the Company exited the preschool children online education service.\n\nEffective October 1, 2020, the Company changed the ticker symbol of its Ordinary Shares traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market from “HHT” to “CSCW”, representing the abbreviation of “Color Star Color World.” Our online platform Color World is the new focus of our business.\n\nOn June 18, 2021, Modern Pleasure International Limited, a limited liability company, was incorporated in Hong Kong and is wholly owned by us. Modern Pleasure International Limited has not commenced operations.\n\nOn June 29, 2021, CACM entered into a share purchase agreement with Baydolphin. Pursuant to the agreement, CACM agreed to sell, and Baydolphin agreed to purchase 80% of the outstanding equity interest of Baytao for a consideration of $100. Prior to the sale, Baytao had no operation or asset. Upon completion of the sale, Baytao ceased to be a subsidiary of the Company.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nWe are an entertainment and education company providing online and offline innovative music education through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Color China.

The notification received had no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Nasdaq has provided us with 45 calendar days, or until January 2, 2020, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity standard. If our plan to regain compliance is accepted, Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notification letter, or until May 16, 2019, to evidence compliance. On January 2, 2020, we submitted our plan of compliance to Nasdaq.\n\nOn January 24, 2020, we received a notice (the “Notice”) from Nasdaq stating that we were not able to regain compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement or the alternative criteria set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b) and that the Staff had determined to seek to delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq unless the Company requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). On January 28, 2020 we requested a hearing before the Panel. Such stays any suspension or delisting action by Nasdaq pending the completion of the hearing process. On January 30, 2020, we received a hearing instruction letter from Nasdaq stating that the delisting action referenced in the Notice has been stayed, pending a final written decision by the Panel.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, the Company appeared before the Panel to demonstrate its ability to regain compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement and subsequently submitted supplemental information to the Panel on March 23, 2020 pursuant to the Panel’s request. By a letter dated April 16, 2020, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that the Panel had determined to continue the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares based upon the Company’s compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement. Additionally, the Panel advised in such letter that is has placed the Company under a Panel Monitor (the “Monitor”) that shall last through April 15, 2021. Pursuant to that Monitor and as provided in the Nasdaq Rules, if at any time during the monitor period the Company fails to maintain compliance with any listing standard, Nasdaq will issue a Staff Delisting Determination and the Hearings Department will promptly schedule a new hearing.\n\nSeparately, on March 5, 2020, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Requirement”). The notification received has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company had until September 1, 2020 to regain compliance. If at any time during such 180-day period the closing bid price of the Company’s ordinary shares is at least $1 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company written confirmation of compliance.\n\n6\n\nOn August 10, 2020, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2), as the Company maintained a closing bid price of $1.00 per share or greater for twenty (20) consecutive days from July 13, 2020 through August 7, 2020. On October 18, 2020, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the Bid Price Requirement again and were granted 180 days or until April 13, 2021 to regain compliance. On April 12, 2021, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2). On April 19, 2021, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that its Panel has determined to continue the listing of the Company’s securities on Nasdaq.\n\nNasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain the compliance with the Nasdaq rules. If we fail to comply with the Bid Price Requirement or any other listing rules when required in the future, we could be subject to suspension and delisting proceedings. If our securities lose their status on The NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities would likely trade in the over-the-counter market. If our securities were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our securities could be more difficult because smaller quantities of securities would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts’ coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event our securities are delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, further limiting the liquidity of our securities. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities. Such delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market and continued or further declines in our share price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions. \n\n**_The price of our ordinary shares historically has been volatile, which may affect the price at which you could sell the ordinary shares._**\n\nOur ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CSCW.” The market price for the ordinary shares has varied between a high bid price of $2.67 on March 30, 2021 and a low bid price of $0.36 on September 24, 2020 in the 12-month period ended on August 16, 2021. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell the ordinary shares. The ordinary share price are likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the following:\n\n● | variations in our revenues, earnings and cash flows;  \n---|---  \n● | announcements of new investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors;  \n● | announcements of new offerings, solutions and expansions by us or our competitors;  \n● | changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;  \n● | detrimental adverse publicity about us, our services or our industry;  \n● | announcements of new regulations, rules or policies relevant for our business;  \n● | additions or departures of key personnel;  \n● | release of lockup or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding equity securities or sales of additional equity securities; and  \n● | potential litigation or regulatory investigations.  \n  \nAny of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our ordinary shares will trade.\n\nIn the past, shareholders of public companies have often brought securities class action suits against those companies following periods of instability in the market price of their securities. If we were to be involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management’s attention and other resources from our business and operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit, which could harm our results of operations. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n**_We do not intend to pay dividends on our ordinary shares for the foreseeable future, but if we intend to do so our holding company structure may limit the payment of dividends to our stockholders._**\n\nWhile we have no current intention of paying dividends, should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including as a result of restrictive covenants in loan agreements, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions as discussed below. If future dividends are paid in Hong Kong dollar (“HKD”), fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of HKD into U.S. dollars may reduce the amount received by U.S. stockholders upon conversion of the dividend payment into U.S. dollars.\n\n7\n\n**_We may be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling our ordinary shares._**\n\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called “penny stocks” to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. If our ordinary shares becomes a “penny stock”, we may become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the “Penny Stock Rule”. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market.\n\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our ordinary shares will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our ordinary shares were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\n\n**_If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding the ordinary shares, the market price for the ordinary shares and trading volume could decline._**\n\nThe trading market for our ordinary shares will be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business. If industry or securities analysts decide to cover us and in the future downgrade our ordinary shares, the market price for our ordinary shares would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price or trading volume for our ordinary shares to decline.\n\n**_Techniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of our ordinary shares._**\n\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller’s interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a security short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market.\n\nPublic companies that have substantially all of their operations in the PRC have been the subject of short selling. Much of the scrutiny and negative publicity has centered on allegations of a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting resulting in financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result, many of these companies are now conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations and, in the interim, are subject to shareholder lawsuits and/or SEC enforcement actions.\n\nIt is not clear what effect such negative publicity could have on us. If we were to become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we could have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. While we would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller by principles of freedom of speech, applicable law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation could be costly and time-consuming, and could distract our management from growing our business. Even if such allegations are ultimately proven to be groundless, allegations against us could severely impact our business operations, and any investment in our ordinary shares could be greatly reduced or even rendered worthless.\n\n8\n\n**_We are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to U.S. domestic public companies._**\n\nBecause we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and regulations in the United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including:\n\n● | the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K;  \n---|---  \n● | the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act;  \n---|---  \n● | the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and  \n---|---  \n● | the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe are required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we intend to publish our results on a quarterly basis as press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Press releases relating to financial results and material events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information that would be made available to you were you investing in a U.S. domestic issuer.\n\n**_Because we are a foreign private issuer and are exempt from certain Nasdaq corporate governance standards applicable to U.S. issuers, you will have less protection than you would have if we were a domestic issuer._**\n\nNasdaq Listing Rules require listed companies to have, among other things, a majority of its board members be independent. As a foreign private issuer, however, we are permitted to, and we may, follow home country practice in lieu of the above requirements, or we may choose to comply with the Nasdaq requirement within one year of listing. The corporate governance practice in our home country, the Cayman Islands, does not require a majority of our board to consist of independent directors. Since a majority of our board of directors will not consist of independent directors, fewer board members will be exercising independent judgment and the level of board oversight on the management of our company may decrease as a result. In addition, the Nasdaq listing rules also require U.S. domestic issuers to have a compensation committee, a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors, and an audit committee with a minimum of three members. We, as a foreign private issuer, are not subject to these requirements. The Nasdaq listing rules may require shareholder approval for certain corporate matters, such as requiring that shareholders be given the opportunity to vote on all equity compensation plans and material revisions to those plans, certain ordinary share issuances. We intend to comply with the requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rules in determining whether shareholder approval is required on such matters and to appoint a nominating and corporate governance committee. However, we may consider following home country practice in lieu of the requirements under Nasdaq listing rules with respect to certain corporate governance standards which may afford less protection to investors.\n\n**_While we have spun off all of our Chinese subsidiaries as of June 30, 2020, adverse regulatory developments in China may subject us to additional regulatory review and expose us to government interference, and additional disclosure requirements and regulatory scrutiny to be adopted by the SEC in response to risks related to recent regulatory developments in China may impose additional compliance requirements for companies like us with significant China-based operations, all of which could increase our compliance costs, subject us to additional disclosure requirements, and/or suspend or terminate our future securities offerings, making capital-raising more difficult._**\n\nWhile our operating entity Color China is based in Hong Kong, not mainland China, the recent regulatory developments in China, in particular with respect to restrictions on China-based companies raising capital offshore, may lead to additional regulatory review in China over our financing and capital raising activities in the United States. In addition, we may become subject to industry-wide regulations that may be adopted by the relevant PRC authorities, which may have the effect of limiting our service offerings, restricting the scope of our operations in China, or causing the suspension or termination of our business operations in China entirely, all of which will materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may have to adjust, modify, or completely change our business operations in response to adverse regulatory changes or policy developments, and we cannot assure you that any remedial action adopted by us can be completed in a timely, cost-efficient, or liability-free manner or at all.\n\n9\n\nOn July 30, 2021, in response to the recent regulatory developments in China and actions adopted by the PRC government, the Chairman of the SEC issued a statement asking the SEC staff to seek additional disclosures from offshore issuers associated with China-based operating companies before their registration statements will be declared effective, including detailed disclosure related to VIE structures and whether the VIE and the issuer, when applicable, received or were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges and the risks that such approval could be denied or rescinded. On August 1, 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission stated in a statement that it had taken note of the new disclosure requirements announced by the SEC regarding the listings of Chinese companies and the recent regulatory development in China, and that both countries should strengthen communications on regulating China-related issuers. While we do not maintain a VIE structure and we have spun off all Chinese subsidiaries as of June 30, 2020, we might be subject to a variety of PRC laws because we have business activities in China from time to time. We cannot guarantee that we will not be subject to tightened regulatory review and exposed to government interference in China. In light of the recent regulatory and policy developments in China and government actions taken by the PRC government, including possible imposition of restrictions and/or approval requirements on China-based companies raising capital offshore, the offering of our securities may be subject to additional disclosure requirements and review that the SEC or other regulatory authorities in the United States may adopt for companies with China-based operations.\n\n**Risks Related to the Current Pandemic**\n\n**_Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19._**\n\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus causing respiratory illness, or COVID-19, has surfaced in Wuhan, China, spreading at a fast rate in January and February of 2020, and has now developed to be a global pandemic. In reaction to this outbreak, an increasing number of countries imposed travel suspensions to and from China following the World Health Organization’s “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) announcement on January 30, 2020. Since this outbreak, business activities in China and many other countries including U.S. have been disrupted by a series of emergency quarantine measures taken by the government.\n\nAs a result, our operations in China and U.S. have been materially affected. For example, we acquired Sunway Kids in February 2020 with the plan to engage education and health services to day-care and preschools in China, but due to the impact of COVID-19, Sunway Kids was unable to conduct its normal operations. Accordingly, we disposed Sunway Kids in June 2020. New York, where our U.S. operations are based, is currently significantly affected by COVID-19, which led to measures taken by the New York government trying to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as reduction on the number of people in gathering and travel restrictions. Additional travel and other restrictions may be put in place to further control the outbreak in U.S. Accordingly, our operation and business have been and will continue to be adversely affected as the results of the wide-spread pandemic. Management may have to adjust or change our business plan in response to the prolonged pandemic and change of social behavior.\n\nThe extent to which COVID-19 negatively impacts our business is highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We believe that the coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to control it may have a significant negative impact on not only our business, but economic activities globally. The magnitude of this negative effect on the continuity of our business operation remains uncertain. These uncertainties impede our ability to conduct our daily operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result affect our stock price and create more volatility.\n\n**Risks Related to the Cayman Islands Law**\n\n**_Economic substance legislation of the Cayman Islands may adversely impact us or our operations._**\n\nThe Cayman Islands has recently enacted the International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Act (2021 Revision), or the Cayman Economic Substance Act. The Company is required to comply with the Cayman Economic Substance Act. As the Company is a Cayman Islands company, compliance obligations include filing annual notifications for the Company, which need to state whether the Company is carrying out any relevant activities and if so, whether the Company has satisfied economic substance tests to the extent required under the Cayman Economic Substance Act. As it is a new regime, it is anticipated that the Cayman Economic Substance Act will evolve and be subject to further clarification and amendments. The Company may need to allocate additional resources to keep updated with these developments, and may have to make changes to our operations in order to comply with all requirements under the Cayman Economic Substance Act. Failure to satisfy these requirements may subject the Company to penalties under the Cayman Economic Substance Act.\n\n**_We are not clear about the ramifications of the Financial Action Task Force’s increased monitoring of the Cayman Islands for us._**\n\nIn February 2021, the Cayman Islands was added to the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) list of jurisdictions whose anti-money laundering practices are under increased monitoring, commonly referred to as the “FATF grey list.” When the FATF places a jurisdiction under increased monitoring, it means the country has committed to resolve swiftly the identified strategic deficiencies within agreed timeframes and is subject to increased monitoring during that timeframe. It is unclear how long this designation will remain in place and what ramifications, if any, the designation will have for the Company.\n\n10\n\n**PRIVATE PLACEMENTS**\n\nOn June 28, 2021, we closed a private placement of 3,000,000 Ordinary Shares, at a purchase price of $1.30 per share for an aggregate offering price of $3,900,000 (the “First Private Placement”).

For additional information regarding the issuance of these securities, see “Private Placements” on page 10 of this prospectus. We are registering the Shares in order to permit the Selling Shareholders to offer such shares for resale from time to time. Except for the ownership of the Shares, the transactions contemplated pursuant to the Purchase Agreements, and as disclosed in this section under “Material Relationships with Selling Shareholders”, none of the Selling Shareholders have had any material relationship with us within the past three years.\n\nThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to each Selling Shareholder, including (i) the Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by the Selling Shareholder prior to this offering, (ii) the number of Shares being offered by the Selling Shareholder pursuant to this prospectus and (iii) the Selling Shareholders’ beneficial ownership after completion of this offering. The registration of the Shares issuable to the Selling Shareholders does not necessarily mean that the Selling Shareholders will sell all or any of such shares, but the number of Ordinary Shares and percentages set forth in the final two columns below assume that all Shares being offered by the Selling Shareholders are sold. See “Plan of Distribution.”\n\nThe table is based on information supplied to us by the Selling Shareholders, with beneficial ownership and percentage ownership determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, and includes voting or investment power with respect to Ordinary Shares. This information does not necessarily indicate beneficial ownership for any other purpose.\n\nThis prospectus covers the resale of up to an aggregate of 22,892,037 Shares that may be sold or otherwise disposed of by the Selling Shareholders. See “Private Placements” in this prospectus for further details relating to the Shares.\n\n**Number of Ordinary Shares Owned Prior to Offering(1)** | Maximum Number of Ordinary Shares to be Sold Pursuant to this Prospectus | **Number of Ordinary Shares Owned After Offering(2)** | **Percentage Beneficially Owned After Offering(2)**  \n---|---|---|---  \nYihan Lin | 3,500,000 | 3,500,000 | 0 |  *  \nMinye Wang | 3,000,000 | 3,000,000 | 0 | *  \nAhmed Muhammad Abrar | 3,500,000 | 3,500,000 | 0 | *  \nLi Yan | 3,500,000 | 3,500,000 | 0 | *  \nUllah Sabar | 3,500,000 | 3,500,000 | 0 | *  \nZubair Ahsan | 3,000,000 | 3,000,000 | 0 | *  \nLu Jian(3) | 1,000,000 | 1,000,000 | 0 | *  \nShuwen Wang(4) | 1,100,000 | 1,100,000 | 0 |  *  \nDawei Chen | 300,000 | 300,000 | 0 | *  \nJianling Chen(5) | 492,037 | 492,037 | 0 | *  \nTOTAL | 22,892,037 | 22,892,037 | 0 | * | %  \n*Less| than 1%  \n---|---  \n(1) | Based on information obtained from the Selling Shareholders.  \n---|---  \n(2) |  The number of shares owned and the percentage of beneficial ownership after this offering set forth in these columns are based on 114,411,629 Ordinary Shares outstanding on August 17, 2021.  \n(3) |  Lu Jian purchased 1,000,000 restricted Ordinary Shares from another shareholder on January 21, 2021.

This shareholder received his shares from the Company as consultancy fee in 2019. Shuwen Wang purchased 1,000,000 restricted Ordinary Shares from another shareholder on January 21, 2021. This shareholder purchased his shares from a prior affiliate entity of the Company in 2020.  \n(5) | Jianling Chen purchased 234,634 restricted Ordinary Shares from Xianfu Han, a former CEO of the Company, and purchased 257,403 restricted Ordinary Shares from Weili He, a former CFO of the Company, both on January 1, 2021.  \n  \n12\n\n**Material Relationships with Selling Shareholders**\n\nIn addition to the transactions described above in “Private Placements,” we have had the following material relationships with the Selling Shareholders in the last three (3) years:\n\nOn August 27, 2020, we issued 300,000 Ordinary Shares to Dawei Chen, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated August 21, 2021 between us and an individual, and an assignment agreement and a debt settlement and release agreement, both dated August 27, 2021 between Dawei Chen and the same individual.\n\n**USE OF PROCEEDS**\n\nThe Selling Shareholders will receive all of the proceeds from the sale of the Shares under this prospectus. We will not receive any proceeds from these sales. The Selling Shareholders will pay any agent’s commissions and expenses they incur for brokerage, accounting, tax or legal services or any other expenses that they incur in disposing of the Shares. We will bear all other costs, fees and expenses incurred in effecting the registration of the Shares covered by this prospectus and any prospectus supplement. These may include, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, SEC filing fees and expenses of compliance with state securities or “blue sky” laws.\n\nSee “Plan of Distribution” elsewhere in this prospectus for more information.\n\n**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**\n\nThe Selling Shareholders and any of their respective pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their securities covered hereby on any trading market, stock exchange or other trading facility on which the securities are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. The Selling Shareholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling securities:\n\n● | ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  \n---|---  \n● | block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the securities as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  \n● | purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;  \n● | an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;  \n● | privately negotiated transactions;  \n● | settlement of short sales;  \n● | in transactions through broker-dealers that agree with the Selling Shareholders to sell a specified number of such securities at a stipulated price per security;  \n● | through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;  \n● | a combination of any such methods of sale; or  \n● | any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.  \n  \nThe Selling Shareholders may also sell securities under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus.\n\n13\n\nBroker-dealers engaged by the Selling Shareholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling Shareholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of securities, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with FINRA IM-2440.\n\nIn connection with the sale of the securities covered hereby, the Selling Shareholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the securities in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The Selling Shareholders may also sell securities short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the securities to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The Selling Shareholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or create one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of securities offered by this prospectus, which securities such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction).\n\nThe Selling Shareholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the securities may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the securities purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. We are requesting that each Selling Stockholder inform us that it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the securities. We will pay certain fees and expenses incurred by us incident to the registration of the securities.\n\nBecause the Selling Shareholders may be deemed to be an “underwriter” within the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act, including Rule 172 thereunder. In addition, any securities covered by this prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus. We are requesting that each Selling Stockholder confirm that there is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale securities by the Selling Stockholder.\n\nWe intend to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the securities may be resold by the Selling Shareholders without registration and without regard to any volume or manner-of-sale limitations by reason of Rule 144, without the requirement for us to be in compliance with the current public information requirement under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the securities have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. The resale securities will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale securities covered hereby may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with.\n\nUnder applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale securities may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the Common Stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the Selling Shareholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of the Common Stock by the Selling Shareholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the Selling Shareholders and are informing the Selling Shareholders of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act).\n\n**LEGAL MATTERS**\n\nExcept as otherwise set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement, certain legal matters in connection with the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus will be passed upon for us by Kaufman & Canoles, P.C. to the extent governed by the laws of the United States, and by Conyers Dill & Pearman LLP to the extent governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands. If legal matters in connection with offerings made pursuant to this prospectus are passed upon by counsel to underwriters, dealers or agents, such counsel will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to any such offering.\n\n**EXPERTS**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in this prospectus for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 have been audited by Wei, Wei & Co., LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as set forth in their report thereon and incorporated herein by reference, and are included in reliance upon such report given on the authority of such firm as experts in accounting and auditing.\n\n14\n\n**FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\nThe financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 are included in our Annual Report on Form 20-F, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus.\n\n**INFORMATION INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE**\n\nThe SEC allows us to “incorporate by reference” into this prospectus the information we file with the SEC.

Since this prospectus may not contain all of the information that you may find important, you should review the full text of these documents. If we have filed a contract, agreement or other document as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, you should read the exhibit for a more complete understanding of the document or matter involved. Each statement in this prospectus, including statements incorporated by reference as discussed above, regarding a contract, agreement or other document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual document.\n\nWe are subject to the information reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that are applicable to foreign private issuers, and, in accordance with these requirements, we file annual and current reports and other information with the SEC. You may inspect, read (without charge) and copy the reports and other information we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an internet website at  _www.sec.gov_ that contains our filed reports and other information that we file electronically with the SEC.\n\nWe maintain a corporate website at https://colorstarinternational.com/. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute a part of this prospectus.\n\n**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**\n\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability. We incorporated in the Cayman Islands because of certain benefits associated with being a Cayman Islands exempted company, such as political and economic stability, an effective judicial system, a favorable tax system, the absence of foreign exchange control or currency restrictions and the availability of professional and support services. However, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of securities laws that provide significantly less protection to investors as compared to the securities laws of the United States. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the United States.\n\nAll of our assets are located in China. In addition, some of our directors and officers are residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our directors and officers, or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\n\nAccording to our local Cayman Islands’ counsel, there is uncertainty with regard to Cayman Islands law relating to whether a judgment obtained from the United States or Hong Kong courts under civil liability provisions of the securities laws will be determined by the courts of the Cayman Islands as penal or punitive in nature. If such a determination is made, the courts of the Cayman Islands will not recognize or enforce the judgment against a Cayman Islands’ company. The courts of the Cayman Islands in the past determined that disgorgement proceedings brought at the instance of the Securities and Exchange Commission are penal or punitive in nature and such judgments would not be enforceable in the Cayman Islands. Other civil liability provisions of the securities laws may be characterized as remedial, and therefore enforceable but the Cayman Islands’ Courts have not yet ruled in this regard. Our Cayman Islands’ counsel has further advised us that a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of the United States under which a sum of money is payable other than a sum payable in respect of taxes, fines, penalties or similar charges, may be subject to enforcement proceedings as a debt in the courts of the Cayman Islands.\n\n16\n\nAs of the date hereof, no treaty or other form of reciprocity exists between the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong governing the recognition and enforcement of judgments.\n\nCayman Islands’ counsel further advised that although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States or Hong Kong, a judgment obtained in such jurisdictions will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment (1) is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction, (2) imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given, (3) is final, (4) is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty, and (5) was not obtained in a manner and is of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands.\n\n**INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES**\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.\n\n17\n\n**COLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.**\n\n**22,892,037 Ordinary Shares**\n\n**PROSPECTUS**\n\n**__, 2021**\n\n**PART II**\n\n**INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS**\n\n**Item 8. Indemnification of Directors and Officers**\n\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our M&A requires us to indemnify our officers and directors for actions, proceedings, claims, losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (“Indemnified Losses”) incurred in their capacities as such unless such Indemnified Losses arise from dishonesty of such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\n\n**Item 9.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement.  \n---|---  \n(iii) | To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.  \n---|---  \n  \n_provided, however_ , that paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission by the registrant pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b).\n\n(2) | That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.  \n---|---  \n(3) | To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.  \n---|---  \n(4) | That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:  \n---|---  \n(i) | Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and  \n---|---  \n(ii) | Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.  _Provided_ ,  _however_ , that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.  \n---|---  \n  \nII-2\n\n(5) | That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:  \n---|---  \n(i) | Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;  \n---|---  \n(ii) | Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;  \n---|---  \n(iii) | The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and  \n---|---  \n(iv) | Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.  \n---|---  \n(b) | That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the registrant’s annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant to section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.  \n---|---  \n(c) | Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.  \n---|---  \n  \nII-3\n\n**SIGNATURES**\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements for filing on Form F-3 and has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of New York, State of New York, on August 18, 2021.\n\n**COLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.**  \n---  \nBy: | /s/ Basil Wilson  \nName:  | Basil Wilson  \nTitle: | Chief Executive Officer  \n(Principal Executive Officer)  \nBy: | /s/ Lili Jiang  \n---|---  \nName:  | Lili Jiang  \nTitle: | Chief Financial Officer  \n(Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting officer)  \n  \n**POWER OF ATTORNEY**\n\nEach person whose signature appears below hereby constitutes and appoints Basil Wilson and Lili Jiang, and each of them, individually, his or her true and lawful attorneys-in-fact and agents, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, in his or her name, place and stead, in any and all capacities (including his capacity as a director and/or officer of the registrant), to sign any and all amendments and post-effective amendments and supplements to this registration statement, and including any registration statement for the same offering that is to be effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and to file the same, with all exhibits thereto and other documents in connection therewith, with the SEC, granting unto said attorneys-in-fact and agents, and each of them, full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in and about the premises, as fully to all intents and purposes as he might or could do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming all that said attorneys-in-fact and agents or any of them, or his substitute, may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, this Form F-3 registration statement has been signed by the following persons in the capacities and on the date indicated.\n\n**Name** | **Position** | **Date**  \n---|---|---  \n/s/ Basil Wilson  | Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board | August 18, 2021  \nBasil Wilson  | (Principal Executive Officer)  \n/s/ Lili Jiang  | Chief Financial Officer | August 18, 2021  \nLili Jiang | (Principal Accounting Officer)  \n/s/ Biao (Luke) Lu | Chief Artistic Officer | August 18, 2021  \nBiao (Luke) Lu  \n/s/ Yingxian (Elaine) Xiang | Director | August 18, 2021  \nYingxian (Elaine) Xiang  \n/s/ Hung-Jn Kuo  | Director | August 18, 2021  \nHung-Jen Kuo  \n/s/ Long Yi  | Director | August 18, 2021  \nLong Yi  \n/s/ Jehan Zeb Khan  | Director | August 18, 2021  \nJehan Zeb Khan  \n  \nII-4\n"

Description of Securities**.\n\nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 5. Interests of Named Experts and Counsel**.\n\nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 6. Indemnification of Directors and Officers**.\n\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Article 42 of the Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association (the “Memorandum and Articles”) of the Company provides that every Director, Secretary, or other officer of the Company (including alternate directors, proxy directors and former directors and officers), any trustee for the time being acting in relation to the Company (including any nominee shareholder holding shares in the Company) and their heirs and personal representatives (each an “Indemnified Person”) shall be entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against all actions, proceedings, costs, damages, expenses, claims, losses or liabilities which they or any of them may sustain or incur by reason of any act done or omitted in or about the execution of the duties of their respective offices or trusts or otherwise in relation thereto, including any liability incurred by him in defending any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgement is given in his favour or in which he is acquitted except to the extent that any of the foregoing arise through his dishonesty.\n\nII-1\n\nNo Indemnified Person shall be liable (a) for any loss, damage or misfortune whatsoever which may happen to or be incurred by the Company in the execution of the duties, powers, authorities or discretions of his office or in relation thereto, (b) for the acts, receipts, neglects, defaults or omissions of any other such Director or person or (c) by reason of his having joined in any receipt for money not received by him personally or (d) for any loss on account of defect of title to any property of the Company or (e) on account of the insufficiency of any security in or upon which any money of the Company shall be invested or (f) for any loss incurred through any bank, broker or other agent or (g) for any loss occasioned by any negligence, default, breach of duty, breach of trust, error of judgement or oversight on his part or (h) for any other loss or damage due to any such cause as aforesaid except to the extent that any of the foregoing arise through his dishonesty.\n\nThe Company shall advance to each Indemnified Person reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnified Person for which indemnity will or could be sought. In connection with any advance of any expenses hereunder, the Indemnified Person shall execute an undertaking to repay the advanced amount to the Company if it shall be determined by final judgment or other final adjudication that such Indemnified Person was not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article. If it shall be determined by a final judgment or other final adjudication that such Indemnified Person was not entitled to indemnification with respect to such judgment, costs or expenses, then such party shall not be indemnified with respect to such judgment, costs or expenses and any advancement shall be returned to the Company (without interest) by the Indemnified Person.\n\nThe Directors, on behalf of the Company, may purchase and maintain insurance for the benefit of any Director or other officer of the Company against any liability which, by virtue of any rule of law, would otherwise attach to such person in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust of which such person may be guilty in relation to the Company.\n\nInsofar as indemnification by us for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to provisions of the Memorandum and Articles, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Commission, such indemnification is against public policy and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification by such director, officer or controlling person of us in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being offered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\n\n**Item 7. Exemption from Registration Claimed**.\n\nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 8. Exhibits**.\n\nReference is hereby made to the Exhibit Index, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n**Item 9. Undertakings**.\n\nA. The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:\n\n(1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement:\n\n(a) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act;\n\nII-2\n\n(b) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of this Registration Statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in this Registration Statement; and\n\n(c) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in this Registration Statement or any material change to such information in this Registration Statement;\n\n_provided_ ,  _however_ , that paragraphs (1)(a) and (1)(b) above do not apply if the information required to be included in a post- effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the Registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference in this Registration Statement.\n\n(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\n(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.\n\nB. The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the Registrant’s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is incorporated by reference in this Registration Statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\nC. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that, in the opinion of the Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\n\nII-3\n\n**SIGNATURES**\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all the requirements for filing on Form S-8 and has duly caused this Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of New York, State of New York on this 15th day of July, 2021.\n\n**COLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.**  \n---  \nBy: | /s/ Basil Wilson  \nName:  | Basil Wilson  \nTitle: | Chief Executive Officer  \nBy: | /s/ Lili Jiang  \n---|---  \nName: | Lili Jiang  \nTitle: | Chief Financial Officer  \n(Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting officer)  \n  \n**POWER OF ATTORNEY**\n\nKNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, the undersigned hereby constitute and appoint Basil Wilson and Lili Jiang, or either of them, his true and lawful attorney-in-facts and agent, each with full power of substitution and resubstitution, for him and in his name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, to sign any and all amendments (including post-effective amendments) or supplements to this Registration Statement, or any related registration statement filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and to file the same, with exhibits thereto, and other documents in connection therewith, with the Commission, granting unto said attorney-in-fact and agents, and each of them, full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite or necessary to be done in connection therewith, as fully to all intents and purposes as he might or could do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming all that each of said attorneys-in-fact and agents, or any of them, or their or his or her substitute or substitutes, may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, this Registration Statement has been signed by the following persons in the capacities and on the dates indicated.\n\n**Name** | **Position** | **Date**  \n---|---|---  \n/s/ Basil Wilson  | Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board | July 15, 2021  \nBasil Wilson  | (Principal Executive Officer)  \n/s/ Lili Jiang  | Chief Financial Officer | July 15, 2021  \nLili Jiang | (Principal Accounting Officer)  \n/s/ Yingxian (Elaine) Xiang | Director | July 15, 2021  \nYingxian (Elaine) Xiang  \n/s/ Hung-Jn Kuo  | Director | July 15, 2021  \nHung-Jen Kuo  \n/s/ Long Yi  | Director | July 15, 2021  \nLong Yi  \n/s/ Jehan Zeb Khan  | Director | July 15, 2021  \nJehan Zeb Khan  \n  \nII-4\n\n**EXHIBIT INDEX**\n\n**Exhibit No.** | **Description**  \n---|---  \n5.1* | [Opinion of Conyers Dill & Pearman (regarding validity of Ordinary Shares being registered).](ea144252ex5-1_colorstar.htm)  \n10.1* | [2021 Equity Incentive Plan of Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.](ea144252ex10-1_colorstar.htm)  \n23.1* | [Consent of Conyers Dill & Pearman (included in its opinion filed as Exhibit 5.1).](ea144252ex5-1_colorstar.htm)  \n23.2* | [Consent of Wei, Wei & Co., LLP](ea144252ex23-2_colorstar.htm)  \n24.1* | [Power of Attorney (included in the signature page hereto).](#a_001)  \n*| filed herewith  \n---|---  \n  \nII-5\n"

We strive to offer students professional artist training platform featuring exclusive content and live interaction. Our mission is to use our know-how and deep industry connections to deliver a world-class entertainment learning experiences and to promote entertainment exchange between the United States and China. We launched our online platform Color World on September 10, 2020, and it is currently operating in China. The curriculum created by us includes music, sports, animation, painting and calligraphy, film and television, life skills. At present, we have signed contracts with well-known international artists and more than 50 celebrity teachers have been retained to launch online lectures. The Color World platform not only has celebrity lectures, but also celebrity concert videos, celebrity peripheral products, such as celebrity branded merchandise, and artist interactive communication. We strive to build an all-star cultural and entertainment industry chain. To establish a new entertainment industry chain combining online and offline options, we plan to establish offline education institutions. The offline education base will train during the day and perform at night. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our plan to establish the offline education base has been delayed. We will adjust our plan in accordance with the development of COVID-19.\n\nThe management believes that we have strong industry resources and influence to become a comprehensive online academy for global “future stars”. We were formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd., and changed our name to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd. in May 2020. Prior to our acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, our core business had been focusing on the concrete business in China.\n\nColor Star Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.) was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C-corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, we changed our name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc.\n\n1\n\nOn August 20, 2018, CACM was incorporated in the State of New York and is wholly owned by us. The establishment of CACM was to expand the Company’s business in the U.S. CACM has not commenced operations. \n\nOn December 27, 2018, we consummated a re-domicile merger pursuant to which we merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Cayman Islands exempted company and the surviving entity in the merger. As a result of the reincorporation, we are now governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nOn July 16, 2019, upon effectiveness of the amendment and restatement of our memorandum and articles of association which was approved by our shareholders, our name was changed from China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. to Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”) and its shareholders. On February 14, 2020, we consummated the acquisition of Sunway Kids whereby we issued 1,989,262 Ordinary Shares and $2 million of cash to be paid in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sunway Kids. The $2 million cash consideration is payable in five installments over five years according to an earn-out schedule. Sunway Kids thereby became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Sunway Kids was established on February 29, 2012, under the laws of the British Virgin Islands as an offshore holding company. On August 23, 2018, Sunway Kids established its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brave Millenium Limited (“Brave Millenium”) under the laws of Hong Kong. On December 4, 2019, Brave Millenium established Chengdu Hengshanghui Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. (“Chengdu Hengshanghui”) in China as a wholly foreign owned limited liability company (the “WFOE”). On December 9, 2019, Chengdu Hengshanghui entered into a series of variable interest entity agreements with Chengdu Hengshanghui Education Consulting Co., Ltd. (“Hengshanghui Education”). Through Sunway Kids and its variable interest entity Hengshanghui Education, we were engaged in providing education and health services to day-care and preschools in China.\n\nOn March 10, 2020, CACM entered into a certain joint venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Baydolphin, Inc., a company organized under the laws of New York (“Baydolphin”). Pursuant to the JV Agreement, CACM and Baydolphin established a limited liability company under the laws of New York, Baytao LLC (“Baytao”) that was intended to be the 100% owner of one or more operating entities in the United States to engage in the business of online and offline after-school education.\n\nPrior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, our core business has been the concrete business in China. Our concrete business was negatively affected by the economic cycle and government policies. The concrete industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The entire concrete industry in the PRC’s Beijing area experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years as the Beijing government continues to enforce concrete production reformation and tightened environmental laws from late 2017 to date. The reformation causes great uncertainties for local enterprises in the construction market. Since 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down. Also, the Beijing government ordered the suspension of construction jobsites during winters to reduce air pollution since 2017. The operations of Xin Ao were also severely affected. As a result of the Company’s deteriorating cash position, we defaulted on bank loans and experienced a substantial increase in contingent liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, we have defaulted on a bank loan of $24,345,129. As of December 31, 2019, Xin Ao was subject to several civil lawsuits for which the Company estimated that it is more than likely to pay judgments in the amount of approximately $6.8 million (including interest and penalties of $1.6 million). During the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were additional estimated claims of approximately $0.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively. We believed it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to turn around the concrete business. As a result, we sought to dispose of the concrete business after the acquisition of Sunway Kids.\n\nOn May 6, 2020, we completed the disposition (the “Xin Ao Disposition”) of Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (“BVI-ACM”), after obtaining our shareholders’ approval on April 27, 2020 and satisfaction or waiver of all other closing conditions. Upon the closing of the Xin Ao Disposition, Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He became the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The proceeds of $600,000 from the Xin Ao Disposition have been used for the Company’s working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nOn April 27, 2020, upon effectiveness of the amendment and restatement of its memorandum and articles of association (which was approved by our shareholders), our name was changed to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.\n\n2\n\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”), a Hong Kong limited company, and shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, we acquired all of the outstanding issued shares and other equity interests in Color China from the sellers (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Color China, we issued 4,633,333 Ordinary Shares of the Company and paid an aggregate of $2,000,000 to the sellers.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the Company and the former shareholders of Sunway Kids entered into an Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment”) to the Share Exchange Agreement dated December 31, 2019, as amended. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company shall not make any Earn-out Payment to the former shareholders of Sunway Kids since Sunway Kids has been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and management of Sunway Kids believes it will be very difficult to achieve its projected financial results. On the same day, Sunway Kids and Yanliang Han (the “Purchaser”), an unrelated third party, entered into certain share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the Purchaser agreed to purchase Sunway Kids for cash consideration of $2.4 million consisting of $400,000 which shall be paid within a month of closing, and $2,000,000 to be paid in monthly installments of $200,000 over 10 months. Upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Disposition SPA on June 25, 2020, the Purchaser became the sole shareholder of Sunway Kids and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by Sunway Kids.\n\nEffective October 1, 2020, we changed the ticker symbol of its Ordinary Shares traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market from “HHT” to “CSCW”, representing the abbreviation of “Color Star Color World.” This is the new focus of our business.\n\nOn June 18, 2021, Modern Pleasure International Limited, a limited liability company, was incorporated in Hong Kong and is wholly owned by us. Modern Pleasure International Limited has not commenced operations. \n\nOn June 29, 2021, CACM entered into a share purchase agreement with Baydolphin. Pursuant to the agreement, CACM agreed to sell, and Baydolphin agreed to purchase 80% of the outstanding equity interest of Baytao for a consideration of $100. Prior to the sale, Baytao had no operation or asset. Upon completion of the sale, Baytao ceases to be a subsidiary of the Company. \n\n**Organizational structure**\n\nBelow is the Company’s corporate structure chart as of the date of this prospectus.\n\n![](img_002.jpg)\n\n3\n\n**_Recent Developments_**\n\n_Securities Purchase Agreement_\n\nOn February 18, 2021, we entered into certain securities purchase agreement with certain investors, pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 20,000,000 units, each unit consisting of one ordinary share and a warrant to purchase one share with an initial exercise price of $1.34 per share, at a price of $1.30 per unit, for an aggregate purchase price of $26,000,000.

During the two fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 and through the subsequent interim period to April 6, 2021, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted Audit Alliance regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or on the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company that Audit Alliance concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of either a disagreement or a reportable event as described above.\n\n_Regain Nasdaq compliance_\n\nOn October 16, 2020, the Company received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Exchange regarding the Company’s failure to comply with Nasdaq Continued Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. A failure to comply with Rule 5550(a)(2) exists when listed securities fail to maintain a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days (including, in particular, the period September 3, 2020 through October 15, 2020), the Company failed to meet the aforesaid requirement.\n\nOn April 7, 2021, the Company received a written notification from the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Qualifications Staff indicating that the Company has regained compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”) and that the matter is now closed.\n\n**Impact of COVID-19**\n\nThe Company’s operations are affected by the recent and ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which in March 2020 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 outbreak is causing lockdowns, travel restrictions, and closures of businesses. Our business has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak to a certain extent.\n\nThe Company’s operations in Asia and the United States have been materially affected. New York, where the Company’s U.S. operations are based, have been significantly affected by COVID-19, which led to measures taken by the New York government trying to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as reduction on the number of people in gathering and travel restrictions. Additional travel and other restrictions may be put in place to further control the outbreak in United States. Accordingly, our operation and business have been and will continue to be adversely affected as the results of the wide-spread pandemic. Management may have to adjust or change business plans in response to the prolonged pandemic and change of social behavior. \n\n5\n\nThe extent to which COVID-19 negatively impacts the business is highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. The Company believes that the coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to control it may have a significant negative impact on not only the business, but economic activities globally. The magnitude of this negative effect on the continuity of the business operation in China and U.S. remains uncertain. These uncertainties impede the Company’s ability to conduct daily operations and could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result affect the Company’s stock price and create more volatility.\n\nBased on assessment of current economic environment, customer demand and sales trend, and the negative impact from COVID-19 outbreak and spread, there is an uncertainty that the Company’s revenue and operating cash flows may be significantly lower than expected for fiscal year 2021.\n\n**Corporate Information**\n\nWe are a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability and conduct business in China through subsidiaries in China.

We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this prospectus, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy, transformation, strategic priorities and future progress, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. \n\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “could,” “intend,” “project,” “believe,” “estimate” or “predict” “or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. The forward-looking statements in this prospectus are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this prospectus and are subject to a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including the factors described in the sections entitled “Risk Factors”, “Business”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the financial statements and related notes thereto contained herein. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise. \n\n8\n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n_You should carefully consider the risks before making an investment decision. You should consider the matters described below and all of the information included in this prospectus before deciding whether to purchase our ordinary shares. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties. In that case, the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”_\n\n**Risks Related to Our Business and Industry**\n\n**_We have a limited operating history with our current business model, which makes it difficult to predict our prospects and our business and financial performance._**\n\nWe have a short operating history with our current business model focusing on providing online entertainment performances and online music education services. We transitioned from a concrete business company to our current business model in 2020. Our limited history of operating under the current business model may not serve as an adequate basis for evaluating our prospect and operating results, including gross billings, net revenues, cash flows and operating margins. We have encountered, and may continue to encounter in the future, risks, challenges and uncertainties associated with operating an internet-based education business and online video streaming service industry, such as building and managing reliable and secure IT systems and infrastructure, addressing regulatory compliance and uncertainty, engaging, training and retaining high quality employees such as our teaching staff and IT support staff, and improving and expanding our education content offering. If we do not manage these risks successfully, our operating and financial results may differ materially from our expectations and our business and financial performance may suffer. \n\n**_We may require additional capital, including to fund potential acquisitions and capital expenditures, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all and which depends on many factors beyond our control._**\n\nTo support our growing business, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our platform and product offerings. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates, require additional restrictive financial and operational covenants, or require us to incur significant transaction fees, issue warrants or other equity securities, or issue convertible securities. These restrictions and covenants may restrict our ability to finance our operations and engage in, expand, or otherwise pursue our business activities and strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, and breaches of these covenants and restrictions could result in a default and an acceleration of our obligations under a debt agreement. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or our solutions under development, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us. \n\nWe evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing and to an extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. \n\n**_Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19._**\n\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus causing respiratory illness, or COVID-19, has surfaced in Wuhan, China, spreading at a fast rate in January and February of 2020, and has now developed to be a global pandemic. In reaction to this outbreak, an increasing number of countries imposed travel suspensions to and from China following the World Health Organization’s “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) announcement on January 30, 2020. Since this outbreak, business activities in China and many other countries including U.S. have been disrupted by a series of emergency quarantine measures taken by the government. \n\n9\n\nAs a result, our operations in China and U.S. have been materially affected. New York, where our U.S. operations are based, is currently significantly affected by COVID-19, which led to measures taken by the New York government trying to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as reduction on the number of people in gathering and travel restrictions. Additional travel and other restrictions may be put in place to further control the outbreak in U.S. Accordingly, our operation and business have been and will continue to be adversely affected as the results of the wide-spread pandemic. Management may have to adjust or change our business plan in response to the prolonged pandemic and change of social behavior. \n\nThe extent to which COVID-19 negatively impacts our business is highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We believe that the coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to control it may have a significant negative impact on not only our business, but economic activities globally. The magnitude of this negative effect on the continuity of our business operation in China and U.S. remains uncertain. These uncertainties impede our ability to conduct our daily operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result affect our stock price and create more volatility. \n\n**_If we are unable to operate the “Color World” platform as planned, our results of operation will be significantly impacted._**\n\nWe launched the “Color World” platform on October 15, 2020. The attractiveness of our platform to our prospective “Star Teachers” and student subscribers depends on our ability to innovate. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and expand our platform and education services. We must also continue to enhance and improve our technology infrastructure. These efforts may require us to develop or license increasingly complex technologies. In addition, new education services and technologies developed and introduced by competitors could render our education services and technologies obsolete if we are unable to update or modify our own technology. Developing and integrating new education services and technologies into our existing platform and infrastructure could be expensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, any new features and functions may not achieve market acceptance. We may not succeed in implementing new technologies, or may incur substantial costs in doing so. Our platform and education services must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order for us to recoup our investments. Our platform and education services could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including: \n\n● |  we may fail to predict market demand accurately and to provide education services that meet this demand in a timely fashion;  \n---|---  \n● |  our marketing efforts may be inefficient and fail to attract the potential users;  \n---|---  \n● |  Star Teachers that we recruit on our platforms may not like, find useful or agree with any changes;  \n---|---  \n● |  there may be defects, errors or failures on our platform;  \n---|---  \n● |  there may be negative publicity about our platforms’ performance or effectiveness; and  \n---|---  \n● |  there may be competing services or technologies introduced or anticipated to be introduced by our competitors.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf our platform and education services or technologies do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. \n\n**_Our success relies on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and qualified key personnel, and our business may be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate them._**\n\nOur business operations depend on the continued services of our senior management team and qualified key personnel, particularly our executive officers and the senior management of Color China, our wholly owned subsidiary. \n\nAlthough we have provided different incentives to our senior management team, we cannot assure you that we can continue to retain their services. One or more of our key executives may be unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions. Meanwhile, we have also provided attractive compensation packages to our qualified key personnel. However, we may not be able to hire and retain these personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Some of the companies with which we compete for qualified and skilled personnel have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. In addition, we invest significant time and resources in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. \n\n10\n\nIf we are unable to retain the services of our senior management team or qualified key personnel, we may not be able to find suitable replacements or may incur significant expenses in finding such replacements, thus our future growth may be constrained, our business may be severely disrupted and our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, although we have entered into confidentiality and non-competition agreements with our senior management team and qualified key personnel, there is no assurance that any member of our senior management team or any of our qualified key personnel will not join a competitor. In the event that any dispute arises between us, on one hand, and any of our senior management and qualified key personnel, on the other hand, we may have to incur substantial costs and expenses in order to enforce such agreements, or we may be unable to enforce them at all. \n\n**_If we are unable to recruit “Star Teachers” as planned or if these instructors do not perform according to the agreements we have with them, the operation of our performance support and music education business will be negatively impacted._**\n\nProfessional artists and producers that we have begun recruiting as our Star Teachers help us build and maintain the quality of our education and services, as well as our brand and reputation. Our ability to continue to attract recruit the instructors with the necessary experience and qualifications is a key factor in the success of our operations. We seek to continue hiring experienced and successful professionals in music, film, sports, animation, television, presentations, dance, art and other entertainment industries whom are able to follow our education service protocols and deliver effective instructions based on the agreements we have with them. The market for the recruitment of these professionals is competitive, and we must also provide continued training to ensure that our instructors stay abreast of changes in student demands, teaching methodologies and other necessary changes. \n\nIn order to recruit these industry professionals as instructors on our platform, we must provide candidates with competitive compensation packages. Although we have not experienced major difficulties in recruiting or training qualified instructors thus far, we cannot guarantee we will be able to continue to recruit, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified instructors in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n**_If we are unable to reach a critical mass of subscribers, our revenues may not be sufficient to cover the costs of our recruitment of Star Teachers._**\n\nWe are obligated to pay each of our Star Teachers on a case-by-case basis depending on the results of our negotiations. Some Star Teachers will accept fixed payments following a predefined schedule, whereas others may instead request a revenue sharing payment model whereby we will need to distribute to the Star Teachers a percentage of the net income earned from generated sales, licensing or other revenue from their courses on our platform, including a pro rata share of our subscription fees, or a hybrid of the two. If we are unable to generate enough revenue from our subscription fees from our users to cover our Star Teachers’ recruitment costs, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. \n\n**_Our education service revenue model depends on developing a subscriber base of users. If we fail to reach a critical mass of subscribers, our net revenues may not be sufficient, and we may not be able to implement our business plan._**\n\nWe expect to generate revenue primarily from the fees we collect from our users. It is critical for us to enroll subscribers in a cost-effective manner. Some of the factors, many of which are largely beyond our control, could prevent us from successfully increasing subscriptions in a cost-effective manner, or at all. These factors include, among other things, (i) reduced interest in the products and services we offer; (ii) negative publicity or perceptions regarding us, or electronic education services in general; (iii) the emergence of alternative technologies not offered by us; (iv) the inability of subscribers to pay the fees; (v) increasing market competition, particularly price reductions by competitors that we are unable or unwilling to match; and (vi) adverse changes in relevant government policies or general economic conditions. If one or more of these factors reduce market demand for our services, our subscriber base may not materialize as anticipated or our costs associated with subscriber acquisition and retention could increase, or both, any of which could materially affect our ability to grow our gross billings and net revenues. These developments could also harm our brand and reputation, which would negatively impact our ability to establish or expand our business. \n\n11\n\n**_We expect to rely heavily on information and technology to operate our existing and future education products and services, and any cybersecurity incident or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could result in the loss of critical confidential information or adversely impact our reputation, business or results of operations._**\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and to compete effectively depends in part upon the satisfactory performance and reliability of our technology network, including the ability to provide features of services that are important to our customers and to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers. We also rely on our technology to maintain and process various operating and financial data that are essential to the day-to-day operation of our business and formulation of our development strategies. Our business operations and growth prospects depend on our ability to maintain and make timely and cost-effective enhancements and upgrades to our technology system and to introduce innovative additions that can meet changing operational needs in future. Therefore, we expect to continue to invest in advanced information technology and any equipment to enhance operational efficiency and reliability as we grow. Accordingly, any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our IT infrastructure could damage our reputation, decrease user satisfaction and retention, adversely impact our ability to attract new users and expand our service and product offerings, and materially disrupt our operations. If any of these occur, our business operations, reputation and prospects could be harmed. \n\n**_If our security measures are breached or fail and result in unauthorized disclosure of data by our employees or our third-party agents, we could lose existing subscribers, fail to attract new subscribers and be exposed to protracted and costly litigation._**\n\nMaintaining platform security is of critical importance to our subscribers because the platform stores and transmits proprietary and confidential information, which may include sensitive personally identifiable information that may be subject to stringent legal and regulatory obligations. As an electronic education service provider, we face an increasing number of threats to our IT infrastructure, including unauthorized activity and access by our employees or third-party agents, system viruses, worms, malicious code and organized cyber-attacks, which could breach our security and disrupt our business. We hope to introduce data security and confidentiality protocols into the cooperation agreements we enter into with third-party sales agents with whom we share prospective subscribers’ contact information. As we expand, we hope to invest in improving our technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans to prevent unauthorized access of confidential or sensitive personal information by our employees and third-party sales agents in the process of engaging prospective subscribers. \n\nThese measures, however, may not be as effective as we anticipate. In addition, there is no assurance that our third-party sales agents will comply with contractual and legal requirements with respect to data privacy when they collect data from our prospective customers. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, we could be subject to liability or our business could be interrupted, potentially over an extended period of time. Any or all of these issues could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to attract and enroll prospective subscribers, cause prospective subscribers not to enroll or stay enrolled, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability. Further, any reputational damage resulting from breach of our security measures could create distrust of our company by prospective subscribers or investors. We may be required to expend significant management time and additional resources to protect against the threat of these disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such disruptions or breaches. \n\n**_Privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our user data and disclosure of user data could adversely impact our business and reputation._**\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business and in particular in connection with conducting sales and marketing activities with our existing and prospective subscribers as well as the utilization of our AI-powered platform programs, we collect and utilize data supplied by our users. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our users in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. \n\n12\n\nInternationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses. \n\n**_We face regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to the licensing requirement for the online transmission of internet audio-visual programs in China._**\n\nOn December 20, 2007, the National Radio and Television Administration f/k/a known as the State Administration of Press Publication Radio Film and Television, or SAPPRFT, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, jointly promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Internet Audio Visual Program Services, or the Audio Visual Program Provisions, which became effective on January 31, 2008 and were amended on August 28, 2015. Among other things, the Audio Visual Program Provisions stipulate that no entities or individuals may provide Internet audio-visual program services without a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs issued by SAPPRFT or completing the relevant filing with SAPPRFT or its local bureaus, and only state-owned or state-controlled entities are eligible to apply for a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs. On April 1, 2010, SAPPRFT promulgated the Provisional Implementations of Tentative Categories of Internet Audio Visual Program Services, or the Categories, which clarified the scope of Internet audio-visual programs services, which was amended on March 10, 2017. According to the Categories, there are four categories of Internet audio-visual program services which are further divided into seventeen sub-categories. Sub-category No. 3 to the second category covers the making and editing of certain specialized audio-visual programs concerning, among other things, educational content, and broadcasting such content to the general public online. Sub-category No. 5 of the first category and sub-category No. 7 of the second category cover the live broadcasting of important political, martial, economic, social, cultural, sports activities or events or general social or community cultural activities, sports games and other organized activities. However, there are still significant uncertainties relating to the interpretation and implementation of the Audio Visual Program Provisions, in particular, the scope of “internet audio-visual programs.” See “Regulations Relating to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs.” \n\nWe plan to deliver our courses in live streaming format worldwide. Our teachers and students communicate and interact live with each other via our virtual learning community. The audio and video data will likely be transmitted through the platforms between specific recipients instantly without any further redaction. We believe the nature of the raw data we transmit will distinguish us from general providers of internet audio-visual program services, such as the operator of online video websites, and the provision of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions are not applicable with regard to our offering of the courses. However, we cannot assure you that the competent PRC government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to our opinion. In addition, we also plan to offer video recordings of live streaming courses and certain other audio-video contents on our electronic platforms to our students as supplementary course materials on our platforms. If the government authorities determine that our offering of the courses fall within the relevant category of Internet audio-visual program services under the Categories, we may be required to obtain the License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs. \n\nThe Categories describe “Internet audio-visual program services” in a very broad, vague manner and are unclear as to whether electronic courses, whether delivered in a live streaming format or through video recordings, fall into the definition of audio-visual programs. We have made inquiries to the relevant bureaus of SAPPRFT and were informed that online educational content provided through live streaming or recorded courses does not fall within the scope of internet audio-visual programs, the transmission of which does not require a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs. We cannot assure you that the PRC government will not ultimately take a view that live streaming or recorded courses or any other content offered on our platforms are subject to the Audio Visual Program Provisions. We currently do not hold a license for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs, and since we are not a state-owned or state-controlled entity, we are not eligible to apply for such license. If the PRC government determines that our content should be considered as “internet audio- visual programs” for the purpose of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, we may be required to obtain a license for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs. We are, however, not eligible apply for such license since we are not a state-owned or state-controlled entity. If this were to occur, we may be subject to penalties, fines, legal sanctions or an order to suspend the provision of our live streaming courses. As of the date of this annual prospectus, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities regarding the lack of a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs in conducting of our business. \n\n13\n\n**_Our failure to obtain and maintain approvals, licenses or permits in China applicable to our business could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations in the future._**\n\nAs we plan to deliver our courses in live streaming format worldwide, including in China, we may be subject to various regulations by a number of PRC regulatory authorities, such as the SAIC, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the MITT, the National Radio and Television Administration, and the State Council Information Office, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Welfare. We may be required in the future to obtain additional government approvals, licenses and permits in connection with our operations. \n\nBy way of example, depending upon regulatory interpretation, under the current PRC laws and regulations, the provision of our educational content through our electronic platform may be considered “online publishing” and may require us to obtain an Internet Publishing License, which we currently do not have. \n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities regarding the lack of any the above-mentioned approvals, licenses or permits. However, we cannot guarantee that the government authorities will not impose any penalties or sanctions on us in the future, which may include warnings, fines, mandates to remedy any violations, confiscation of the gains derived from the services for which approvals, licenses or permits are required, and/or an order to cease to provide such services. In addition, we cannot guarantee that the government will not promulgate new laws and regulations that require additional licenses, permits and/or approvals for the operation of any of our existing or future business. If we are unable to obtain such licenses, permits, or approvals in a timely fashion, we could be subject to penalties and operational disruption and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. \n\n**_We face intense competition which could adversely affect our results of operations and market share._**\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is sensitive to price, content (i.e., curriculum) and quality of service. Some of our competitors may have more financial resources, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do, or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to obtain or raise capital and enter into strategic relationships more easily. We also compete with leading domestic supplier companies based on a number of factors including business model, operational capabilities, cost control and service quality, as well as in-house delivery capabilities to serve their logistics needs and compete with us. \n\nWe are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that affect many other businesses, including but not limited to: \n\n(1) |  Increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare benefits;   \n---|---  \n(2) |  The increasing costs of compliance with federal, state and foreign governmental agency mandates;   \n---|---  \n(3) |  Any impacts on our business resulting from new domestic and international government laws and regulation;   \n---|---  \n(4) |  Market conditions in the childhood education industry or the economy as a whole;   \n---|---  \n(5) |  Market acceptance of our new service and growth initiatives;   \n---|---  \n(6) |  Announcements of the introduction of new products and services by our competitors;   \n---|---  \n(7) |  The impact of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our products and services;   \n---|---  \n(8) |  Developments concerning current or future strategic collaborations; and   \n---|---  \n(9) |  Widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis such as we are currently experiencing with the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n---|---  \n  \nIf we are unable to respond to these changing market conditions, our business and financial results may be materially affected. \n\n14\n\n**_We may be unable to fund any significant up-front and/or guaranteed payment cash requirements associated with our live music streaming rights, which could result in the inability to secure and retain such streaming rights and may limit our operating flexibility, which may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition._**\n\nIn order to secure event and festival live music streaming rights or hold concerts, we may be required to fund significant up-front and/or guaranteed payment cash requirements to artists or festival or event promoters prior to the event or festival taking place. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand or available capacity to advance the necessary cash for any given artist, event or festival, we would not be able to retain the rights for that artist, festival or event, such counter parties may be able to terminate their content acquisition agreements with us, and as a result our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. \n\n**_We may be unsuccessful in developing our original content._**\n\nWe plan to continue to produce original classes, covering various areas such as singing and dancing, etc. We believe that a positive reputation with users concerning our original content is important in attracting and retaining users. To the extent our content is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to users, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. If the original content we produce does not attract new users, we may not be able to cover our expenses to produce such programs, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. \n\nAs we continue to develop our original content, we will become responsible for higher production costs and other expenses. We may also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. To the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims. \n\n**_We face competition for users’ attention and time._**\n\nThe market for entertainment video content is intensively competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as (i) interactive on-demand audio content and pre-recorded entertainment, (ii) broadcast radio providers, including terrestrial and Internet radio providers, (iii) cable, satellite and Internet television and movie content providers, (iv) video gaming providers and (v) other sources of entertainment for our users’ attention and time. These content and service providers pose a competitive threat to the extent existing or potential users choose to consume their content or use their services rather than our content or our services. The online marketplace for live music and music-related content may rapidly evolve and provide users with a number of alternatives or new access models, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\n**_Our services and software are highly technical and may contain undetected software bugs or vulnerabilities, which could manifest in ways that could seriously harm our reputation and our business._**\n\nOur services and software are highly technical and complex. Our services or any other products we may introduce in the future, may contain undetected software bugs, hardware errors, and other vulnerabilities. These bugs and errors can manifest in any number of ways in our products, including through diminished performance, security vulnerabilities, malfunctions, or even permanently disabled products. We have a practice of regularly updating our products and some errors in our products may be discovered only after a product has been used by users, and may in some cases be detected only under certain circumstances or after extended use. Any errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities discovered in our code or backend after release could damage our reputation, drive away users, allow third parties to manipulate or exploit our software (including, for example, providing mobile device users a means to suppress advertisements without payment and gain access to features only available to the ad-supported service), lower revenue and expose us to claims for damages, any of which could seriously harm our business. Additionally, errors, bugs, or other vulnerabilities may—either directly or if exploited by third parties—affect our ability to make accurate royalty payments. \n\n15\n\nWe also could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention and seriously harm our reputation and our business. In addition, if our liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be seriously harmed. \n\n**_Our business depends on a strong developing brand, and any failure to create, maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to attract and/ or expand our base of users._**\n\nMaintaining, protecting and enhancing our brand is critical to expanding our base of users and star teachers, and will depend largely on our ability to continue to develop and provide an innovative and high-quality experience for our users and to attract more celebrities to work with us, which we may not do successfully. Our brands may be impaired by a number of other factors, including any failure to keep pace with technological advances on our platform or with our services, slower load times for our services, a decline in the quality or quantity of the content available on our services, a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or any alleged violations of law, regulations, or public policy. If we do not successfully maintain a strong brand, our business could be harmed. \n\n**_We are at risk of attempts at unauthorized access to our services, and failure to effectively prevent and remediate such attempts could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Unauthorized access to our services may cause us to misstate key performance indicators, which once discovered, corrected, and disclosed, could undermine investor confidence in the integrity of our key performance indicators and could cause our stock price to drop significantly._**\n\nWe may be impacted by attempts by third parties to manipulate and exploit our software for the purpose of gaining unauthorized access to our service. For example, there might be instances of third parties seeking to provide mobile device users a means to suppress advertisements without payment and gain access to features only available to the ad-supported services. If in the future we fail to successfully detect and address such issues, it may have artificial effects on our key performance indicators, such as content hours, content hours per MAU, and MAUs, which underlie, among other things, our contractual obligations with advertisers, as well as harm our relationship with them. This may impact our results of operations, particularly with respect to margins on our ad-supported segment, by increasing our ad-supported cost of revenue without a corresponding increase to our ad-supported revenue, which could seriously harm our business. Additionally, unlike our ad-supported users, individuals using unauthorized versions of our application are unlikely to convert to premium subscribers. Moreover, once we detect and correct such unauthorized access and any key performance indicators it affects, investor confidence in the integrity of our key performance indicators could be undermined. These could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. \n\n**_If we are forced to cancel or postpone all or part of a scheduled concert, our business may be adversely impacted, and our reputation may be harmed._**\n\nWe incur a significant amount of up-front costs when we plan and prepare for an online concert. Accordingly, if a planned concert is canceled, we would lose a substantial amount of sunk costs, fail to generate the anticipated revenue and may be forced to issue refunds for tickets sold. If we are forced to postpone a concert or event, we would incur substantial additional costs in connection with our having to stage the event on a new date, may have reduced attendance and revenue and may have to refund money to ticketholders. In addition, any cancellation or postponement could harm both our reputation and the reputation of the particular concert or event. We could be compelled to cancel or postpone all or part of an event or concert for many reasons, including such things as low attendance, adverse weather conditions, technical problems, issues with permitting or government regulation, incidents, injuries or deaths at that event or concert, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as pandemics, terrorist attacks, mass-casualty incidents and natural disasters or similar events. \n\n16\n\n**_A deterioration in general economic conditions and its impact on consumer and business spending, particularly by customers in our targeted millennial generation demographic, could adversely affect our revenue and financial results._**\n\nOur business and financial results are influenced significantly by general economic conditions, in particular, those conditions affecting discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending. During economic slowdowns and recessions, many consumers could reduce their discretionary spending. An economic downturn can result in reduced ticket revenue and lower customer spending. \n\n**_We depend on relationships with key event promoters, sponsor and marketing partners, executives, managers and artists, and adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nOur business is particularly dependent upon personal relationships, as promoters and executives within entertainment companies such as ours leverage their network of relationships with artists, agents, managers and sponsor and marketing partners to secure the rights to the performers and events that are critical to our success. Due to the importance of those industry contacts, the loss of any of our officers or other key personnel who have relationships with these artists, agents or managers could adversely affect our venue management and event promotion businesses. While we have hiring policies and procedures and conduct background checks of our promoters, executives, managers and artists, they may engage in or may have in the past engaged in conduct we do not endorse or that is otherwise improper, which may result in reputational harm to us. Also, to the extent artists, agents and managers we have relationships with are replaced with individuals with whom our officers or other key personnel do not have relationships, our competitive position and financial condition could be adversely affected. \n\n**_We may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties._**\n\nFrom time to time, we may be in the future subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement and other violations of the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties. \n\nWe may not be able to successfully defend against such claims, which may result in a limitation on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims and also might require us to enter into settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face an injunction prohibiting us from using the affected intellectual property in connection with our services. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel from the rest of our business. \n\nIn addition, music, Internet, technology, and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property rights. Many companies in these industries, including many of our competitors, have substantially larger patent and intellectual property portfolios than we do, which could make us a target for litigation as we may not be able to assert counterclaims against parties that sue us for patent, or other intellectual property infringement. In addition, various “non-practicing entities” that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert claims in order to extract value from technology companies. Further, from time to time we may introduce new products and services, including in territories where we currently do not have an offering, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities. It is difficult to predict whether assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or any infringement or misappropriation claims arising from such assertions will substantially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. If we are forced to defend against any infringement or misappropriation claims, whether they are with or without merit, are settled out of court, or are determined in our favor, we may be required to expend significant time and financial resources on the defense of such claims. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay significant damages, which may be even greater if we are found to have willfully infringed upon a party’s intellectual property; cease exploiting copyrighted content that we have previously had the ability to exploit; cease using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our solutions; enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, content, or materials; indemnify our partners and other third parties; and/or take other actions that may have material effects on our business, operating results, and financial condition. \n\n17\n\n**_Changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business._**\n\nWe will rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the Internet. Changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. To the extent that network operators implement usage-based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our subscriber acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. \n\n**_The success of our business and operations depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures, as well as affiliate and third-party computer systems, Wi-Fi and other communication systems. System interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructures may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nSystem interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in the information systems and infrastructures, both of our own systems and other computer systems and of affiliate and third-party software, Wi-Fi and other communications systems service providers on which we rely, may adversely affect our ability to operate websites, process and fulfill transactions, respond to user inquiries and generally maintain cost-efficient operations. Such interruptions could occur by virtue of natural disaster, malicious actions such as hacking or acts of terrorism or war, or human error. In addition, the loss of some or all of certain key personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain our software and systems and could subject us to systems interruptions. \n\nAlthough we maintain up to date information technology systems and network infrastructures for the operation of our businesses, techniques used to gain unauthorized access to private networks are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to our systems and data. \n\n**_Privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data and compliance with privacy regulations could result in significant expense._**\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our users, we collect and utilize data supplied by our users. We may face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the Internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws, that limit our ability to use collected data, could have an adverse effect on our business. As our business evolves and as we expand internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of user information, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur significant expenses. \n\nIn addition, we cannot fully control the actions of third parties who may have access to the user data we collect and the user data collected by our third-party vendors. We may be unable to monitor or control such third parties and the third parties having access to our website in their compliance with the terms of our privacy policies, terms of use, and other applicable contracts, and we may be unable to prevent unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, user information. Any such misuse could hinder or prevent our efforts with respect to growth opportunities and could expose us to liability or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, these third parties may become the victim of security breaches or have practices that may result in a breach, and we could be responsible for those third-party acts or failures to act. \n\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us or the prior owners of acquired businesses to maintain the privacy of data relating to our users (including disclosing data in a manner that was objectionable to our users), to comply with our posted privacy policies, our predecessors’ posted policies, laws and regulations, rules of self-regulatory organizations, industry standards and contractual provisions to which we or they may be bound, could result in the loss of confidence in us, or result in actions against us by governmental entities or others, all of which could result in litigation and financial losses, and could potentially cause us to lose users, advertisers, revenue and employees. \n\n18\n\n**_We do not have insurance coverage that is customary and standard for companies of comparable size in comparable industries._**\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, we have not obtained sufficient insurance coverage that is customary and standard for companies of comparable size in comparable industries, such as any liability insurance and insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, military conflicts, and wars, which could subject us to significant financial losses. The realization of any of these risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. \n\n**Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Ordinary Shares**\n\n**_If we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, we would face possible delisting, which would result in a limited public market for our shares and make obtaining future debt or equity financing more difficult for us._**\n\nOn November 18, 2019, we received a notification letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Stockholder Equity Requirement”). The notification received had no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Nasdaq has provided us with 45 calendar days, or until January 2, 2020, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity standard. If our plan to regain compliance is accepted, Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notification letter, or until May 16, 2019, to evidence compliance. On January 2, 2020, we submitted our plan of compliance to Nasdaq. \n\nOn January 24, 2020, we received a notice (the “Notice”) from Nasdaq stating that we were not able to regain compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement or the alternative criteria set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b) and that the Staff had determined to seek to delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq unless the Company requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). On January 28, 2020 we requested a hearing before the Panel. Such request will stay any suspension or delisting action by Nasdaq pending the completion of the hearing process. On January 30, 2020, we received a hearing instruction letter from Nasdaq stating that the delisting action referenced in the Notice has been stayed, pending a final written decision by the Panel. \n\nOn March 12, 2020, the Company appeared before the Panel to demonstrate its ability to regain compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement and subsequently submitted supplemental information to the Panel on March 23, 2020 pursuant to the Panel’s request. By a letter dated April 16, 2020, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that the Panel had determined to continue the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares based upon the Company’s compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement. Additionally, the Panel advised in such letter that is has placed the Company under a Panel Monitor (the “Monitor”) that shall last through April 15, 2021. Pursuant to that Monitor and as provided in the Nasdaq Rules, if at any time during the monitor period the Company fails to maintain compliance with any listing standard, Nasdaq will issue a Staff Delisting Determination and the Hearings Department will promptly schedule a new hearing. \n\nSeparately, on March 5, 2020, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Requirement”). The notification received has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company had until September 1, 2020 to regain compliance. If at any time during such 180-day period the closing bid price of the Company’s ordinary shares is at least $1 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company written confirmation of compliance. \n\nOn August 10, 2020, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2), as the Company maintained a closing bid price of $1.00 per share or greater for twenty (20) consecutive days from July 13, 2020 through August 7, 2020. On October 18, 2020, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the Bid Price Requirement again and were granted 180 days or until April 13, 2021 to regain compliance. \n\n19\n\nNasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain the compliance with the Nasdaq rules. If we fail to comply with the Bid Price Requirement or any other listing rules when required in the future, we could be subject to suspension and delisting proceedings. If our securities lose their status on The NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities would likely trade in the over-the-counter market. If our securities were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our securities could be more difficult because smaller quantities of securities would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts’ coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event our securities are delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, further limiting the liquidity of our securities. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities. Such delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market and continued or further declines in our share price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions. \n\n**Risks Related to This Offering**\n\n**_The price of our ordinary shares historically has been volatile, which may affect the price at which you could sell the ordinary shares._**\n\nOur ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CSCW.” The market price for the ordinary shares has varied between a high bid price of $2.67 on March 30, 2021 and a low bid price of $0.44 on September 25, 2020 in the 12-month period ended on June 21, 2021. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell the ordinary shares. The ordinary share price are likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the following:\n\n● | variations in our revenues, earnings and cash flows;  \n---|---  \n● | announcements of new investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors;  \n● | announcements of new offerings, solutions and expansions by us or our competitors;  \n● | changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;  \n● | detrimental adverse publicity about us, our services or our industry;  \n● | announcements of new regulations, rules or policies relevant for our business;  \n● | additions or departures of key personnel;  \n● | release of lockup or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding equity securities or sales of additional equity securities; and  \n● | potential litigation or regulatory investigations.  \n---|---  \n  \nAny of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our ordinary shares will trade.\n\nIn the past, shareholders of public companies have often brought securities class action suits against those companies following periods of instability in the market price of their securities. If we were to be involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management’s attention and other resources from our business and operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit, which could harm our results of operations. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n20\n\n**_We do not intend to pay dividends on our ordinary shares for the foreseeable future, but if we intend to do so our holding company structure may limit the payment of dividends to our stockholders._**\n\nWhile we have no current intention of paying dividends, should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including as a result of restrictive covenants in loan agreements, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions as discussed below. If future dividends are paid in RMB, fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of RMB into U.S. dollars may reduce the amount received by U.S. stockholders upon conversion of the dividend payment into U.S. dollars.\n\nChinese regulations currently permit the payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. Our subsidiaries in China are also required to set aside a portion of their after tax profits according to Chinese accounting standards and regulations to fund certain reserve funds. Currently, our subsidiaries in China are the only sources of revenues or investment holdings for the payment of dividends. If they do not accumulate sufficient profits under Chinese accounting standards and regulations to first fund certain reserve funds as required by Chinese accounting standards, we will be unable to pay any dividends.\n\n**_We may be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling our ordinary shares._**\n\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called “penny stocks” to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. If our ordinary shares become a “penny stock”, we may become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the “Penny Stock Rule”. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market.\n\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our ordinary shares will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our ordinary shares were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\n\n**_If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding the ordinary shares, the market price for the ordinary shares and trading volume could decline._**\n\nThe trading market for our ordinary shares will be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business. If industry or securities analysts decide to cover us and in the future downgrade our ordinary shares, the market price for our ordinary shares would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price or trading volume for our ordinary shares to decline.\n\n21\n\n**_Techniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of our ordinary shares._**\n\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller’s interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a security short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market.\n\nPublic companies that have substantially all of their operations in the PRC have been the subject of short selling. Much of the scrutiny and negative publicity has centered on allegations of a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting resulting in financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result, many of these companies are now conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations and, in the interim, are subject to shareholder lawsuits and/or SEC enforcement actions.\n\nIt is not clear what effect such negative publicity could have on us. If we were to become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we could have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. While we would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller by principles of freedom of speech, applicable law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation could be costly and time-consuming, and could distract our management from growing our business. Even if such allegations are ultimately proven to be groundless, allegations against us could severely impact our business operations, and any investment in our ordinary shares could be greatly reduced or even rendered worthless.\n\n**_We are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to U.S. domestic public companies._**\n\nBecause we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and regulations in the United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including:\n\n● | the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K;  \n---|---  \n● | the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act;  \n---|---  \n● | the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and  \n---|---  \n● | the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe are required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we intend to publish our semi-annual results as press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Press releases relating to financial results and material events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information that would be made available to you were you investing in a U.S. domestic issuer.\n\n**_Because we are a foreign private issuer and are exempt from certain Nasdaq corporate governance standards applicable to U.S. issuers, you will have less protection than you would have if we were a domestic issuer._**\n\nNasdaq Listing Rules require listed companies to have, among other things, a majority of their board members be independent. As a foreign private issuer, however, we are permitted to, and we may, follow home country practice in lieu of the above requirements, or we may choose to comply with the Nasdaq requirement within one year of listing. The corporate governance practice in our home country, the Cayman Islands, does not require a majority of our board to consist of independent directors. Since a majority of our board of directors will not consist of independent directors, fewer board members will be exercising independent judgment and the level of board oversight on the management of our company may decrease as a result. In addition, the Nasdaq listing rules also require U.S. domestic issuers to have a compensation committee, a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors, and an audit committee with a minimum of three members. As a foreign private issuer, we are not subject to these requirements. The Nasdaq listing rules may require shareholder approval for certain corporate matters, such as requiring that shareholders be given the opportunity to vote on all equity compensation plans and material revisions to those plans and certain ordinary share issuances. We intend to comply with the requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rules in determining whether shareholder approval is required on such matters and to appoint a nominating and corporate governance committee. However, we may consider following home country practice in lieu of the requirements under Nasdaq listing rules with respect to certain corporate governance standards which may afford less protection to investors.\n\n22\n\n**MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA**\n\nThis prospectus contains industry, market and competitive position data that are based on industry publications and studies conducted by third parties as well as our own internal estimates and research.

We anticipate that we will retain any earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business. Therefore, we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including future earnings, capital requirements, financial conditions and future prospects and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant.\n\nUnder Cayman Islands law and our Articles of Association, we may pay a dividend out of either profits or our share premium account but a dividend may not be paid if this would result in the company being unable to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business.\n\nIf we determine to pay dividends on any of our ordinary shares in the future, as a holding company, we will depend on receipt of funds from Color China. Current Chinese regulations permit our China Operating Companies to pay dividends to Color Star only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our subsidiaries in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Our China Operating Companies are also required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund, although the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion of its board of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. Our subsidiaries in China are required to set aside statutory reserves and have done so.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to the China Enterprise Income Tax Law (“EIT Law”) and its implementation rules, dividends generated after January 1, 2008 and distributed to us by Color China are subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10% unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties or arrangements between the Chinese central government and governments of other countries or regions where the non-Chinese-resident enterprises are incorporated.\n\nUnder existing Chinese foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. Specifically, under the existing exchange restrictions, without prior approval of SAFE, cash generated from the operations in China may be used to pay dividends to our company.\n\n27\n\n**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\n_You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report._\n\n**Overview**\n\n__Summary of Business__\n\nWe are an entertainment and education company which provides online entertainment performance and online music education services via our wholly-owned subsidiary, Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”). Our core business used to be concrete business. In February 2020, the Company acquired Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”) and consequently shifted its business from concrete business to online education service, targeting preschool children. In May and June 2020, the Company completed the disposition of its former subsidiary, Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (along with its subsidiary and the variable interest entity in China) and Sunway Kids, respectively, and exited the concrete business and preschool children online education service. In June 2020, the Company acquired Color China and thereafter became engaged in the businesses of providing online and offline paid knowledge services for the media, entertainment and culture industries globally. \n\nColor China is an emerging company in the performance support and music education business with a significant collection of music performance specific equipment. The hiring of our management team has extensive experience in large-scale entertainment performance, music equipment leasing and intellectual property (“IP”) licensing. Our newly appointed CEO, Mr. Biao Lu, has unique experience in working with many renowned artists and has established good relationships with major record companies and entertainment agencies around the world. Leveraging its unique resources, Color China was in the process of building an online entertainment and music education platform featuring artists and professional producers as its lead instructors. The online cultural entertainment platform, Color World, was officially launched globally on September 10, 2020. We will be producing and streaming celebrity-taught online lessons and celebrity generated content videos on this platform. The platform will also create a live-streaming and audio community and serve as an e-commerce channel for commercialized celebrity IP products. \n\n28\n\n__Management’s Plan for the Business__\n\nWe believe that the online entertainment and music education platform built by Color China will bring innovative changes to the current state of music education and entertainment industry, with the goal to eliminate the boundaries of nationality, region, and cultural differences in the entertainment and music areas. Through the Internet, Color China can provide professional entertainment and music education globally. We aim to recruit an All-Star Crew to be coaches on the Color Star program, including top-notch professional vocalists, producers, musicians and more. \n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and caused massive global health and economic crisis, while also causing large-scale social and behavioral changes in societies. Online entertainment and education are experiencing enormous growth which we believe will last long after the pandemic. We believe that these market conditions have created tremendous opportunities for our business plans, and therefore we expect to focus on the expansion of Color China’s in light of their great potential for revenue generation and profitability. \n\n**Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance**\n\nWe believe that the following factors will continue to affect our financial performance: \n\n● |  Experienced Management. Management’s technical knowledge and business relationships give us the ability to collaborate with major record companies, entertainment agencies and teaching experts, which provides us with leverage to expand our recognition, promote our products and attract more students rapidly. If there were to be any significant turnover in our senior management, it could deplete the expertise and knowledge held by our existing senior management team.  \n---|---  \n● |  Innovation Efforts. We strive to produce the most innovative advanced products to the users of our platforms. We entered into technical service contracts with platform developers and program licensees to further improve our products and to better user experience. If our research and development efforts were not sufficient to adapt to the change in technology in the industries, our products might not compete effectively.  \n---|---  \n  \nResults of Operations \n\nThe tables in the following discussion summarize our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated. The operating results in any period are not necessarily of the results that may be expected for any future period. \n\n_For the Six Months Ended December 31, 2020 vs. December 31, 2019_\n\n**For the six months ended**  \n---  \n**December 31,**  \n**Percentage**  \n**2020** |  **2019** |  **Change** |  **Change**  \nRevenue  |  $ |  2,330,000  |  $ |  -  |  $ |  2,330,000  |  100 |  %   \nCost of revenue  |  1,936,520  |  -  |  1,936,520  |  100 |  %   \nGross profit  |  393,480  |  -  |  393,480  |  100 |  %   \nSelling, general and administrative expenses  |  (2,678,821 |  )  |  (392,722 |  )  |  2,286,099  |  582 |  %   \nResearch and development expenses  |  (448,508 |  )  |  -  |  448,508  |  100 |  %   \nStock compensation expense  |  (2,261,308 |  )  |  (1,829,067 |  )  |  432,241  |  24 |  %   \nLoss from operations  |  (4,995,157 |  )  |  (2,221,789 |  )  |  2,773,368  |  125 |  )%   \nTotal other income (expense), net  |  21,543  |  (708 |  )  |  (22,251 |  )  |  (3,143 |  )%   \nLoss before provision for income taxes  |  (4,973,614 |  )  |  (2,222,497 |  )  |  2,751,117  |  124 |  %   \nProvision for income taxes  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  - |  %   \nLoss from continuing operations  |  (4,973,614 |  )  |  (2,222,497 |  )  |  2,751,117  |  124 |  %   \nLoss from discontinued operations  |  -  |  (5,279,543 |  )  |  (5,279,543 |  )  |  (100 |  )%   \nNet loss  |  $ |  (4,793,614 |  )  |  $ |  (7,502,040 |  )  |  $ |  (2,528,426 |  )  |  (34 |  )%   \n  \n29\n\n**_Revenue_. **We generated approximately $2.3 million subscription revenue from the online concert we held on September 10, 2020. Our sale of online concert via subscription fee is accounted for as a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time on the day of the event. The online concert subscription revenue we recognized is net of App payment collections agent service fee. \n\n**_Cost of revenue_.** Our cost of revenue of approximately $1.9 million was the total payments we made to our partners of the online concert we held on September 10, 2020. The partners include artists, artist agents and online concert producers. \n\n**_Gross profit_.** We had a gross profit of approximately $0.4 million for the online concert business during the six months ended December 31, 2020. \n\n**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_. **Selling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of advertising and marketing costs, office rent and expenses, depreciation expense, costs associated with staff and support personnel who manage our business activities, and professional fees paid to third parties. We incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $2.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to approximately $0.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019, an increase of approximately $2.3 million. The increase was primarily due to approximately $0.7 million increase in salary expenses as we hired more employees for our online concert and online education academy business, approximately $0.7 million increase in depreciation expense for our newly purchased equipment, and approximately $0.5 million increase in professional fees such as legal fee, audits fee and consulting services, approximately $0.2 million of advertising expenses on our events and APP products, approximately $0.1 million increase in travel and rental expenses and approximately $0.1 million increase in other miscellaneous selling, general and administrative expenses. \n\n**_Research and Development Expenses_. **Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with development of our online platforms. We spent approximately $0.1 million on developing our online education academy APP – Color World internally, incurred approximately $0.3 million amortization expense of the online courses patent, and spent $48,000 on developing the online after-school tutoring program of Baytao during the six months ended December 31, 2020. \n\n**_Stock Compensation Expenses_.** Stock compensation expenses were approximately $2.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to approximately $1.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019. The increase was mainly due to approximately $1.1 million expenses on the 1,590,000 ordinary shares issued to 13 employees under the 2019 Employee Incentive Plan and approximately $0.4 million expenses higher of its stock based compensation expenses on vested service from our CEO, CFO and former CEO offset by $0.9 million lower amortization expenses of other consulting services during the six months ended December 31, 2020. \n\n**_Loss from Operations._** We incurred a loss from operations of approximately $5.0 million and approximately $2.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase of approximately $2.8 million was primarily due to the reasons previously discussed. \n\n**_Total Other Income (Expense), Net_.** Our total other income (expense), net consists of other income, interest income and finance expense. We had total other income (expense), net of $21,543 and ($708) during the six months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change was mainly due to a debt settled with a vendor resulted in a gain of approximately $25,000 and governmental subsidy of approximately $7,200. The change was also due to that we had more bank services charges during the six months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 as we had more bank payment services transactions under Color China. \n\n30\n\n**_Provision for Income Taxes._** We did not incur income tax expense for the six months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as we had operating losses. \n\n**_Loss from Continuing Operations_.** Our loss from continuing operations increased by approximately $2.8 million, or 124%, to loss from continuing operations of approximately $5.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2020 from a loss from continuing operations of approximately $2.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019. Such change was the result of the combination of the changes discussed above. \n\n**_Loss from Discontinued Operations_.** Our loss from discontinued operations was approximately $5.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019 mainly generated by our discontinued operations as Xin Ao, a variable interest entity of BVI-ACM, which we disposed BVI-ACM in May 2020. \n\n**_Net Loss._** We incurred a net loss of approximately $5.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to a net loss of approximately $7.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019. This change was the result of the combination of the changes as discussed above. \n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.4 million, which was held by our consolidated entities in the U.S. and Hong Kong. \n\nIn assessing our liquidity, we monitor and analyze our cash on-hand and our operating and capital expenditure commitments. Our liquidity needs are to meet our working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. \n\nWe engage in online entertainment performance and online education services. Our business is capital intensive, and equity financing has been utilized to finance our working capital requirements and capital expenditures. Our working capital was approximately $3.9 million as of December 31, 2020 as compared to approximately $2.6 million as of June 30, 2020. \n\nIn addition, due to the nature of online entertainment performance and online education industries, we collect payments in advance so we should have minimal liquidity risk. We also completed a few rounds of equity financing, and received net proceeds of approximately $10.9 million from sales of our ordinary shares and conversion of warrants during the six months ended December 31, 2020. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we completed one round of equity financing, and received gross proceeds of approximately $30.6 million from sales of our ordinary shares and conversion of warrants. \n\nBased on the above considerations, management is of the opinion that we have sufficient funds to meet our working capital requirements for the next twelve months from the date of this report. \n\nThe following table provides summary information about our net cash flow for financial statement periods presented in this report: \n\n**For the six months ended**  \n---  \n**December 31,**  \n**2020** |  **2019**  \nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities  |  $ |  (4,676,723 |  )  |  $ |  79,435   \nNet cash used in investing activities  |  (6,863,770 |  )  |  -   \nNet cash provided by financing activities  |  10,931,116  |  -   \nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents  |  $ |  (607,377 |  )  |  $ |  79,435   \n  \n31\n\nPrincipal demands for liquidity are for working capital and general corporate purposes. \n\n**_Operating Activities_**\n\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $4.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2020, which was mainly due to a net loss of approximately $5.0 million and non-cash adjustments to reconcile the net loss to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $2.3 million of stock compensation expense, approximately $0.7 million of depreciation expense and approximately $0.2 million of amortization expense. Net cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net cash outflow, which mainly included cash outflow for increase of accounts receivable of approximately $1.9 million for the online concert subscription fees due from App payment collections agent, increase of prepayment of $0.9 million as we prepaid service fees for online concert performance and online artists agents, and the increase of other payables and accrued liabilities of approximately $0.1 million. \n\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $80,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2019, which was mainly due to a net loss of approximately $2.2 million and adjustments to reconcile the net loss to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $1.8 million of stock compensation expense, offset by the cash inflow for the increase of other payables and accrued liabilities of approximately $0.1 million and the increase of other payables – related parties of approximately $0.3 million. \n\n**_Investing Activities_**\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $6.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2020, which was primarily attributable to the purchase of equipment of $2.0 million and purchase of intangible assets of approximately $4.9 million. \n\nWe did not have any cash investing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2019. \n\n**_Financing Activities_**\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $10.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2020, which was due to the sale of ordinary shares of approximately $10.3 million and the proceeds from warrants conversion of approximately $0.6 million. \n\nWe did not have any cash financing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2019. \n\n**Statement Regarding Unaudited Financial Information**\n\nThe unaudited financial information set forth above is subject to adjustments that may be identified when audit work is performed on the Company’s year-end financial statements, which could result in significant differences from this unaudited financial information. \n\n_For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 vs. June 30, 2019_\n\nFor the Years ended   \n---  \nJune 30,   \nPercentage   \n2020  |  2019  |  Change  |  Change   \nSelling, general and administrative expenses  |  $ |  (1,598,984 |  )  |  $ |  (2,065,829 |  )  |  $ |  (466,845 |  )  |  (23 |  )%   \nResearch and development expenses  |  (120,000 |  )  |  -  |  120,000  |  100 |  %   \nStock compensation expense  |  (3,444,617 |  )  |  (4,592,200 |  )  |  (1,147,583 |  )  |  (25 |  )%   \nLoss from operations  |  (5,163,601 |  )  |  (6,658,029 |  )  |  (1,494,428 |  )  |  (22 |  )%   \nTotal other expense, net  |  (5,041 |  )  |  (1,393 |  )  |  3,648  |  262 |  %   \nLoss before provision for income taxes  |  (5,168,642 |  )  |  (6,659,422 |  )  |  (1,490,780 |  )  |  (22 |  )%   \nProvision for income taxes  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  - |  %   \nNet loss from continuing operations  |  (5,168,642 |  )  |  (6,659,422 |  )  |  (1,490,780 |  )  |  (22 |  )%   \nLoss from discontinued operations  |  (6,457,955 |  )  |  (7,729,108 |  )  |  (1,271,153 |  )  |  (16 |  )%   \nNet loss  |  $ |  (11,626,597 |  )  |  $ |  (14,388,530 |  )  |  $ |  (2,761,933 |  )  |  (19 |  )%   \n  \n32\n\n**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_. **Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of advertising and marketing costs, office rent and expenses, costs associated with staff and support personnel who manage our business activities, and professional fees paid to third parties. We incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to approximately $2.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, a decrease of approximately $0.5 million. The decrease was primarily due to approximately $0.3 million decrease in salary expenses, approximately $0.1 million decrease in audit fees and approximately $0.2 million decrease in repair costs and consulting services. The decrease was offset by approximately $0.1 million increase in legal fees as we performed various acquisitions and disposals during the year ended June 30, 2020. \n\n**_Research and Development Expenses_. **Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with development of our online platforms. We spent approximately $0.1 million on the online after-school tutoring program of Baytao during the year ended June 30, 2020. \n\n**_Stock Compensation Expenses_.** Stock compensation expenses were approximately $3.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to approximately $4.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease was mainly due to lower amortization expenses in 2020 as a result a decline in deferred stock compensation. \n\n**_Loss from Operations._** We incurred a loss from operations of approximately $5.2 million and approximately $6.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease of approximately $1.5 million was primarily due to the reasons previously discussed. \n\n**_Total Other Expense, Net_.** Our total other expense, net consists of interest income and finance expense. We had total other expense, net of $5,041 and $1,393 during the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase was mainly due to that we had more bank services charges in the year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019. \n\n**_Provision for Income Taxes._** We did not incur income tax expense for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 as we had operating losses. \n\n**_Loss from Continuing Operations_.** Our loss from continuing operations decreased by approximately $1.5 million, or 22%, to loss from continuing operations of approximately $5.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 from a loss from continuing operations of approximately $6.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. Such change was the result of the combination of the changes discussed above. \n\n**_Loss from Discontinued Operations_.** Our loss from discontinued operations decreased by approximately $1.3 million, or 16%, to a loss of approximately $6.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, from a loss of approximately $7.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in loss from discontinued operations was predominantly due to gain on sale of discontinued operations of approximately $6.6 million as we sold BVI-ACM with significant net deficit to our prior shareholders for cash consideration of $600,000. The closing of the disposition was completed on May 6, 2020. The decrease was mainly offset by increased loss from discontinued operations as Xin Ao, a variable interest entity of BVI-ACM, which considered as a major part of discontinued operations generated less revenues and more bad debt expenses during the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. In addition, the decrease of net loss from discontinue operations also was offset by the loss on sale of Sunway Kids. We acquired Sunway Kids in February 2020. However, due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, the Company was unable to start Sunway Kids’ business and therefore decided to sell Sunway Kids at a loss of approximately $0.8 million to minimize any further losses. \n\n**_Net Loss._** We incurred a net loss of approximately $11.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, as compared to a net loss of approximately $14.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. This change was the result of the combination of the changes as discussed above. \n\n33\n\n_For the Years Ended June 30, 2019 vs. June 30, 2018_\n\nFor the Years ended   \n---  \nJune 30,   \nPercentage   \n2019  |  2018  |  Change  |  Change   \nSelling, general and administrative expenses  |  $ |  (2,065,829 |  )  |  $ |  (918,605 |  )  |  $ |  1,147,224  |  125 |  %   \nStock compensation expense  |  (4,592,200 |  )  |  (1,388,501 |  )  |  3,203,699  |  231 |  %   \nLoss from operations  |  (6,658,029 |  )  |  (2,307,106 |  )  |  4,350,923  |  189 |  %   \nTotal other expense, net  |  (1,393 |  )  |  (13 |  )  |  1,380  |  10,615 |  %   \nLoss before provision for income taxes  |  (6,659,422 |  )  |  (2,307,119 |  )  |  4,352,303  |  189 |  %   \nProvision for income taxes  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  - |  %   \nLoss from continuing operations  |  (6,659,422 |  )  |  (2,307,119 |  )  |  4,352,303  |  189 |  %   \nLoss from discontinued operations  |  (7,729,108 |  )  |  (5,092,846 |  )  |  2,636,262  |  52 |  %   \nNet loss  |  $ |  (14,388,530 |  )  |  $ |  (7,399,965 |  )  |  $ |  6,988,565  |  94 |  %   \n  \n**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_**. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of marketing costs, office rent and expenses, costs associated with staff and support personnel who manage our business activities, and professional fees paid to third parties. We incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $2.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to approximately $0.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2018, an increase of approximately $1.1 million. The increase was primarily due to approximately $1.0 million increase in professional expenses, including legal expenses, consulting expenses and audit fees, and approximately $0.1 million increase in repairs and maintenance expense as compared to the year ended June 30, 2018. \n\n**_Stock Compensation Expenses_.** Stock compensation expenses was approximately $4.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to approximately $1.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2018 for business consulting services and the amortization of stock compensation expenses for our ordinary shares issued to our employees. The increase of stock compensation expenses was mainly due to the issuance of our ordinary shares to two service providers on merger and acquisition consulting services with fair value of compensation of approximately $2.8 million. \n\n**_Loss from Operations._** We incurred a loss from operations of approximately $6.7 million and a loss of approximately $2.3 million for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase of approximately $4.3 million loss was primarily due to the reasons previously discussed. \n\n**_Total Other Expense, Net_.** Our total other expense, net consists of interest income and finance expense. We had total other expense, net of $1,393 and $13 during the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was mainly due to we had more bank services charges in the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. \n\n**_Provision for Income Taxes._** We did not incur income tax expense for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 as we had net operating losses. \n\n**_Loss from Continuing Operations_.** Our loss from continuing operations increased by approximately $4.4 million, or 189%, to loss from continuing operations of approximately $6.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2019 from a loss from continuing operations of approximately $2.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2018. Such change was the result of the combination of the changes discussed above. \n\n**_Loss from Discontinued Operations_.** Our loss from discontinued operations increased by approximately $2.6 million, or 52%, to a loss of approximately $7.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, from a net loss of approximately $5.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2018. The increase in loss from discontinued operations was predominantly due to the decrease of gross profit which was driven by the decrease in sales volume and increase of inventory unit price of Xin Ao, our main operation of discontinued operations during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. \n\n34\n\n**_Net Loss._** We incurred net loss of approximately $14.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, as compared to a net loss of approximately $7.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2018. This change was the result of the combination of the changes as discussed above. \n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.0 million, which was held by our consolidated entities in the U.S. \n\nIn assessing our liquidity, we monitor and analyze our cash on-hand and our operating and capital expenditure commitments. Our liquidity needs are to meet our working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. \n\nWe engage in online entertainment performance and online education services. Our business is capital intensive, and equity financing has been utilized to finance our working capital requirements and capital expenditures. Our working capital was approximately $2.6 million as of June 30, 2020 as compared to working deficit approximately $1.1 million as of June 30, 2019. \n\nIn addition, due to the nature of online entertainment performance and online education industries, we collect payments in advance so we should have minimal liquidity risk. We also completed a few rounds of equity financing and sold approximately $4.5 million of our ordinary shares during the year ended June 30, 2020. Subsequent to June 30, 2020, we completed three more rounds of equity financing and sold approximately $11.8 million of our ordinary shares. \n\nBased on the above considerations, management is of the opinion that we have sufficient funds to meet our working capital requirements for the next twelve months from the date of this report. \n\nThe following table provides summary information about our net cash flow for financial statement periods presented in this report: \n\nFor the Years Ended June 30,   \n---  \n2020  |  2019  |  2018   \nNet cash used in operating activities from continuing operations  |  $ |  (2,738,989 |  )  |  $ |  (1,002,383 |  )  |  $ |  (239,376 |  )   \nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities from discontinued operations  |  203,854  |  (73,759 |  )  |  2,689,394   \nNet cash used in investing activities from continuing operations  |  (1,394,728 |  )  |  -  |  -   \nNet cash used in investing activities from discontinued operations  |  -  |  (135,705 |  )  |  (138,151 |  )   \nNet cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations  |  4,802,901  |  950,000  |  600,000   \nNet cash used in financing activities from discontinued operations  |  (7,294 |  )  |  (427,333 |  )  |  (6,395,823 |  )   \nEffect of exchange rate change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash  |  (1,943 |  )  |  (62,025 |  )  |  149,203   \nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash  |  $ |  863,801  |  $ |  (751,205 |  )  |  $ |  (3,334,753 |  )   \n  \nPrincipal demands for liquidity are for working capital and general corporate purposes. \n\n35\n\n**_Operating Activities_**\n\nNet cash used in operating activities from continuing operations totaled approximately $2.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, which was attributable to a net loss of approximately $5.2 million and adjustments to reconcile the net loss to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $3.4 million of stock compensation expense. Net cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net cash outflow, which mainly included cash inflow for increase of prepayment of $1.1 million as we prepaid service fees for online concert performance, program license fees and vehicle purchase. Net cash outflow was primarily offset by the increase of other payables and accrued liabilities of approximately $0.1 million. \n\nNet cash used in operating activities from continuing operations totaled approximately $1.0 for the year ended June 30, 2019, which was attributable to a net loss of approximately $6.7 million and adjustments to reconcile the net loss to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $4.6 million of stock compensation expense.

(“CACM”). \n\nColor Star Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.) was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C-corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, we changed our name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. \n\nOn August 20, 2018, CACM Group NY, Inc. (“CACM”) was incorporated in the State of New York and is wholly owned by us. The establishment of CACM was to expand the Company’s business in the U.S. CACM has not commenced operations. On December 27, 2018, we consummated a re-domicile merger pursuant to which we merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Cayman Islands company and the surviving entity in the merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger adopted in July 2018. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company is now governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands. \n\nOn July 16, 2019, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of the Company’s memorandum and articles of association which was approved by the Company’s shareholders, the Company’s name was changed from China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. to Huitao Technology Co., Ltd. \n\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”) and its shareholders. On February 14, 2020, the Company consummated the acquisition of Sunway Kids whereby we issued 1,989,262 ordinary shares and $2 million of cash to be paid in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sunway Kids. The $2 million cash consideration is payable in five installments over five years according to an earn-out schedule. Sunway Kids thereby became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Sunway Kids was established on February 29, 2012, under the laws of the British Virgin Islands as an offshore holding company. On August 23, 2018, Sunway Kids established its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brave Millenium Limited (“Brave Millenium”) under the laws of Hong Kong. On December 4, 2019, Brave Millenium established Chengdu Hengshanghui Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. (“Chengdu Hengshanghui”) in China as a wholly foreign owned limited liability company (the “WFOE”). On December 9, 2019, Chengdu Hengshanghui entered into a series of variable interest entity agreements with Chengdu Hengshanghui Education Consulting Co., Ltd. (“Hengshanghui Education”). Through Sunway Kids and its variable interest entity Hengshanghui Education, we were engaged in providing education and health services to day-care and preschools in China. \n\n38\n\nOn March 10, 2020, CACM entered into a certain joint venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Baydolphin, Inc., a company organized under the laws of New York (“Baydolphin”). Pursuant to the JV Agreement, CACM and Baydolphin have established a limited liability company under the laws of New York, Baytao LLC (“Baytao”), which was intended to be the 100% owner of one or more operating entities in the U.S. to engage in the business of online and offline after-school education. \n\nPrior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, our core business has been the concrete business in China. Our concrete business was negatively affected by the economic cycle and government policies. The concrete industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The entire concrete industry in the PRC’s Beijing area experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years as the Beijing government continues to enforce concrete production reformation and tightened environmental laws from late 2017 to date. The reformation causes great uncertainties for local enterprises in the construction market. Since 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down. Also, the Beijing government ordered the suspension of construction jobsites during winters to reduce air pollution since 2017. The operations of Xin Ao were also severely affected. As a result of the Company’s deteriorating cash position, we defaulted on bank loans and experienced a substantial increase in contingent liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, there was a default on a bank loan of $24,345,129. As of December 31, 2019, Xin Ao is subject to several civil lawsuits for which the Company estimated that it is more than likely to pay judgments in the amount of approximately $6.8 million (including interest and penalties of $1.6 million). During the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were additional estimated claims of approximately $0.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The Company believed it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to turn around the concrete business. As such, the Company had been actively seeking to dispose of the concrete business after the acquisition of Sunway Kids. \n\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company completed the disposition (the “Xin Ao Disposition”) of Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (“BVI-ACM”), after obtaining its shareholders’ approval on April 27, 2020 and satisfaction or waiver of all other closing conditions. Upon the closing of the Xin Ao Disposition, Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He became the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The proceeds of $600,000 from the Xin Ao Disposition have been used for the Company’s working capital and general corporate purposes. \n\nOn April 27, 2020, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of its memorandum and articles of association (which was approved by the Company’s shareholders), the Company’s name was changed to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd. \n\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”), a Hong Kong limited company, and shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company shall acquire all of the outstanding issued shares and other equity interests in Color China from the sellers (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Color China, the Company shall issue 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company and pay an aggregate of $2,000,000 to the sellers. The Company plans to make Color China an emerging online performance and online music education provider with a significant collection of performance specific assets -- leveraging professional experience of the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) who has established good relationships with major record companies, renowned artists and entertainment agencies around the world. Immediately after the Acquisition, Color Star will own 100% of Color China. On June 3, 2020, the transaction contemplated by the Exchange Agreement was consummated when the Company issued 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company to the Sellers and the Sellers transferred all of Color China’s issued and outstanding shares to the Company. \n\nOn June 25, 2020, the Company and the former shareholders of Sunway Kids entered into an Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment”) to the Share Exchange Agreement dated December 31, 2019, as amended. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company shall not make any Earn-out Payment to the former shareholders of Sunway Kids since Sunway Kids has been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and management of Sunway Kids believes it will be very difficult to achieve its projected financial results. On the same day, Sunway Kids and Yanliang Han (the “Purchaser”), an unrelated third party, entered into certain share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the Purchaser agreed to purchase Sunway Kids for cash consideration of $2.4 million consisting of $400,000 which shall be paid within a month of closing, and $2,000,000 to be paid in monthly installments of $200,000 over 10 months. Upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Disposition SPA on June 25, 2020, the Purchaser became the sole shareholder of Sunway Kids and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by Sunway Kids. \n\nEffective October 1, 2020, the Company changed the ticker symbol of its ordinary shares traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market from “HHT” to “CSCW”, representing the abbreviation of “Color Star Color World.” This is the new focus of the Company’s business. \n\n39\n\nOn June 18, 2021, Modern Pleasure International Limited, a limited liability company, was incorporated in Hong Kong and is wholly owned by us.

We strive to offer students professional artist training platform featured by exclusive content and live interaction, with the mission of delivering world-class entertainment learning experiences and promoting entertainment exchange between U.S. and China with our strong resources and deep connections in industry. We launched our online platform Color World on September 10, 2020 and it is currently operating in China. The curriculum development created by us includes music, sports, animation, painting and calligraphy, film and television, life skills, etc., covering plenty of aspects of entertainment, sports and culture. At present, we have signed contracts with well-known international artists and more than 50 celebrity teachers have been retained to launch online lectures. The Color World platform not only has celebrity lectures, but also celebrity concert videos, celebrity peripheral products, such as celebrity branded merchandise, and artist interactive communication. We strive to build an all-star cultural and entertainment industry chain. To establish a new entertainment industry chain combining online and offline, we also plan to establish offline education institutions. The offline education base will train during the day and perform at night to make the training base a commercial operation. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our plan to establish the offline education base has been delayed. The management of the Company will adjust our plan of development in accordance with the development of COVID-19. \n\n42\n\nThe management believes that we, along with our alliance, have strong industry resources and influence to become a comprehensive online academy for global “future stars”. The Company was formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd., and changed its name to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd. in May 2020. Prior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, the Company’s core business had been focusing on the concrete business in China. \n\n**Our Competition**\n\nThe online education market is rapidly expanding and estimated to reach $320 billion by 20251. With the acceleration of online learning due to social distancing, this industry is experiencing huge growth. We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is sensitive to price, content (i.e. curriculum) and quality of service. With online learning adoption accelerating and creating new opportunities, competition is heating up for companies actively competing to capture market share, with the presence of a large number of service and content providers in the market bringing huge volumes of educational content online. \n\nWe face intense competition in our online business and compete primarily with online education providers and content sharing platforms who are already established and who are beginning to target entertainment education, with a trend of “fan culture” and “idol economies” in Asia where talent shows are popular and have launched a large number of amateur stars. We are uniquely positioned, as a comprehensive online and offline entertainment education services provider with all-star teacher lineup, as well as the strong resources and wide connections in industry. Below are a few of our closest competitors below and the unique ways we are differentiated in our view. \n\n● |  MasterClass is an American online education platform on which students can access tutorials and lectures pre-recorded by experts in various fields. Unlike us who offer students a professional artists training platform featured by exclusive content and live interaction, MasterClass’ classes are typically not interactive, though at least one course included “interactive assignments” where the student acted with other students, either in person or over Skype. Classes cover topics like writing, sports, and cooking, with 33 artist instructors focused on entertainment and music teaching. MasterClass’ member subscription fee is $15/month, a little more expensive than us.   \n---|---  \n● |  LearnWorlds is a stand-alone online course platform for instructors to create, sell and promote their online courses. Users will be charged at least $79 per month to either sell courses or get access to free courses, which means that everyone who is qualified (not just experts and celebrities) could create and sell their courses on the platform. Users are not offered abundant tools for marketing their courses.   \n---|---  \n● |  Vimeo is an American video hosting, sharing, and services platform headquartered in New York City. Vimeo operates on an ad-free basis, and instead derives revenue by providing subscription plans for video content producers and offering software as a service (SaaS) with video creation, editing, and broadcasting tools, enterprise software solutions, as well as the means for video professionals to connect with clients and other professionals.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Our Competitive Strengths**\n\nWe differ from various other competitors in our core content of “star online + entertainment teaching” and the combination of online and offline teaching. We are set to break past the boundaries between celebrity entertainment and online knowledge-sharing, and offers students a professional artists training platform featured by exclusive content and live interaction by top artists and celebrities globally, as the first online platform to bring western artists to attract Asian students and meanwhile enabling Asian artists to enter the Western markets. The Company is well connected with artists from Asian to Western, and is able to group many international superstars into its proprietary platform “Color World”. As more international stars join in, coupled with our international version App to be launched in the near future, we expect the Company will continue to expand its subscriber base and gain market share, and bring innovative changes to the current state of music education and entertainment industry. We believe we are as well positioned in the industry with our all-star instructor lineup, excellent combination of online and offline learning, as well as the strong resources and extensive connections, which we believe most competitors lack. \n\n1 |  Research and Markets.

The continued shift of education from in person to virtual is driving higher demand and significant revenue for market vendors in the industry. We target a large addressable market driven by the rapid expansion of global online education, and the rise of the “fan economies” in Asia where the younger generation is more willing to attend their idol’s livestream and spend money on their idols. Meanwhile, the popularity of talent competition shows in Asia has also inspired more ordinary people to enter the entertainment industry and pursue their dreams of being a star. We as a comprehensive entertainment education services provider, could address the growing demand from both fans and talents, and provide professional entertainment education to more than 2 billion people worldwide; and   \n---|---  \n● |  **We are well positioned to capture market share with an experienced management team, all-star instructor lineup, and the combination of online and in-person training.** We strive to offer students professional artists training platform featured by exclusive content and live interaction and are well connected with artists from Asia and U.S., establishing strategic partnerships with top record companies and entertainment agencies.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Our Operations**\n\nWe are growing to become combination of creating the world’s top online and offline celebrity entertainment sharing platform. We provide online and offline innovative music education through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Color China and CACM. We currently cooperate with a non-affiliate company and utilize their relevant licenses and permits that allow us to conduct our business in China through a two-year authorization agreement, pursuant to which the we shall pay an annual fee of RMB100,000 (approximately $15,101). We strive to offer students professional artist training platform featured by exclusive content and live interaction, with the mission of delivering world-class entertainment learning experiences and promoting entertainment exchange between U.S. and China with its strong resources and deep connections in industry. Prior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, the Company’s core business had been focusing on the concrete business in China. We used to provide materials through our ready-mixed concrete plant in Beijing. \n\n**_Online Business_**\n\n**Online Education Academy**\n\nThe core content of “star online + entertainment teaching” offers a variety of stars and a relatively rich entertainment teaching experience. By registering online, students can select their favorite tutors to conduct accurate and efficient learning, and access to exclusive online video classes and tutorials by top artists globally. \n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, our online platform Color World has been launched and is operating in China. The curriculum development created by us includes music, sports, animation, painting and calligraphy, film and television, life skills, etc., covering plenty of aspects of entertainment, sports and culture. At present, we have signed contracts with well-known international artists and more than 50 celebrity teachers have been launched. The Color World platform not only has celebrity lectures, but also celebrity concert videos, celebrity peripheral products, and artist interactive communication. The platform focuses on the interactive participation of members and fans, making the platform more entertaining. Fans can interact with their idols, and they can also upload their own works for celebrity tutors and audiences across the network to watch comments. The celebrity live streaming section, which was launched on October 15, 2020, allows more celebrities to communicate and interact with our users through the Internet. \n\n2 |  Research and Markets. April 16, 2020. https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/16/2017102/0/en/Global-Online-Education-Market-Worth-319-Billion-by-2025-North-America-Anticipated-to-Provide-the-Highest-Revenue-Generating-Opportunities.html  \n---|---  \n  \n44\n\nThe Color World platform generates revenue primarily through paid membership subscriptions priced at $9.90 per user per month. Members can access most video courses on the platform for free and will be charged the tuition fee of $30/hour for taking classes of tier 1 artists and $15/hour for learning from Tier 2 artists. First three months of launch costs only $1.5/hour to attract downloads and there have been over 500,000 registered users as of the date of this prospectus. \n\nWe are well connected with artists from Asia to the U.S., and have built strategic partnerships with globally renowned record companies and entertainment agencies, such as Universal Music Group and Sony Music, which enable us to group a number of artists into its Color World platform and secure the rights to the exclusive streaming of online lessons taught by the star teachers. Currently, we have entered into educational licensing and performance agreements with approximately over 40 global artists and professionals in industry for their services as instructors on the Color World platform, and are seeking out and contracting more star teachers in a variety of fields such as music, film, sports, animation, television, presentations, dance, and art to provide its prospective student subscribers with a large repertoire of first-hand exposure to and lessons from professionals in their desired fields. \n\n**Online Concert**\n\nThe Company established its own music festival brand “Color International Music Festival” and its CEO has the experiences of holding more than 100 star concerts with its partners every year. On September 9, 2020, we broadcasted the Color World Online Concert with ten Eastern and ten Western top artists/celebrities including Grammy-winning jazz guitarist Larry Carlton, R&B singer-songwriter Ashanti, and “Pop Music Queen” Na Ying from mainland China to global audiences via its official platform “Color World” and attracted over half a million viewers from mainland China and all over the world to watch online, reaching over 10 million hits on global social media networks, which we believe is a milestone to the Company. \n\n**Online Store**\n\nOur Color World App is expected to add an online store feature on October 25, 2020, mainly selling celebrity co-branded peripheral products including clothing, shoes, hats, watches, digital products, wine, and other categories. An increased number of active users can also be expected, as more fans join and use the App, allowing us in a more competitive position to provide complete experience for global users. \n\n**_Offline Business_**\n\n**Music Festival**\n\nWe are currently in discussion with multiple well-established music festival brands to co-organize up to 30 music festivals with different genres over the next five years in different cities across Asia and beyond. The management of the Company will closely monitor the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and adjust our plans of co-organizing the music festivals to protect the safety of our customers and employees and to comply with the applicable laws and regulations. \n\n**Our Customers**\n\nWe had no sales during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 from our continuing operations and we had no accounts receivable as of June 30, 2020. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we had two customers, whose sales accounted for more than 10% of our total sales from discontinued operations. Five customers accounted for approximately 52.1% of the Company’s sales for the year ended June 30, 2019 from discontinued operations. The total accounts receivable from these customers from discontinued operations amounted to approximately $13.4 million as of June 30, 2019. \n\n45\n\n**Sales and Marketing**\n\n**_Marketing Channels_**\n\nWe market our course offerings and enhance brand awareness through various online and mobile channels. We place advertisements and conduct marketing on mainstream social media platforms in China. At the same time, we also generate sales leads from word-of-mouth referrals by our students and parents of students. We believe our high quality course offerings and satisfactory student experience will continue to contribute word-of-mouth referrals. \n\nA unique approach for the online concert promotions was adopted by the Company where ticket prices were initially set very low with additional opportunities for purchasers to take part in the distribution of ticket sales in order to receive referral rewards. This indirect ticket sales model, and a large amount of resulting passive income, promises more diversified marketing strategies for online music. \n\n**Research and Development**\n\n**_Technology and Infrastructure_**\n\nTechnology is the backbone of our highly scalable business model. Our strong technological capabilities enable us to deliver a superior student experience and improve operational efficiency. Our technology team, coupled with our proprietary artificial intelligence technology and the growing volume of data generated from our operations, has continued to identify opportunities for improvements in our technology infrastructure and applications. \n\n**_Live Broadcasting Technology_**\n\nLive broadcasting technology development has been our main focus since our inception. Currently, our proprietary live broadcasting technology makes it possible for as many as 200,000 students to join a live broadcasting class simultaneously, without compromising video quality. \n\n**Intellectual Property**\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, we have two domain names: www.colorstarinternational.com and www.color-star.cn. \n\n**Our Labor Force**\n\nAs of October 30, 2020, we employed 40 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees. As required by applicable PRC law, we have entered into employment contracts with all our officers, managers and employees. We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees and we have not experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulty in recruiting staff. \n\n**Restatement and Independent Investigation**\n\nOn October 6, 2018, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with the Company’s then independent registered public accounting firm, Friedman LLP (“Friedman”) concluded, that the Company’s audited financial statements at and for the period ended June 30, 2017 contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K originally filed with the SEC on September 28, 2018 as well as the unaudited financial statements at and for the periods ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 contained in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q originally filed on November 15, 2017, February 13, 2018 and May 15, 2018, respectively, should no longer be relied upon. The Company’s review of the above mentioned filings revealed that the financial statements in such filings contained errors primarily as a result of omission of certain contingencies. \n\nAs a result of such review, the Company has restated the financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as well as those for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017. \n\n46\n\nAs a result of the errors described above, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the ends of each of the applicable restatement periods. \n\nIn connection with above finding, the Audit Committee commenced an independent investigation into the reasons that led to the Company’s conclusion that the previously filed financials should no longer be relied upon. Specially, the Audit Committee engaged an independent investigation team to investigate the circumstances surrounding errors in Company’s financial statements, which primarily resulted from the omission of certain actual and contingent legal liabilities. The investigation concluded in mid-November 2018. The investigation team found several reasons that appear to have caused, or contributed to, the failures to promptly identify and disclose the legal proceedings and contingencies, including, 1) the Head of the Legal Department’s significant lack of understanding of the important of timely disclosure of legal proceedings and the Legal Department’s problematic decision-making process with regard to reporting of legal proceedings; 2) the Company’s lack of accounting personnel trained in U.S. GAAP; 3) the Company’s need for a full-time CFO; 4) the ongoing lack of communication and coordination between executive management and the various departments within the Company; and 5) the Company’s failures to timely address significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. \n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, the Company has completed its process of conducting a comprehensive review of the issues identified by the investigation team and has taken all remedial measures recommended by the Audit Committee within its resources to cure the majority of its material weaknesses in its internal and disclosure control procedures. \n\nMatters relating to or arising from the Audit Committee investigation and the associated material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting, including adverse publicity, have caused us to incur significant legal, accounting and other professional fees and other costs, have exposed us to greater risks associated with other civil litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions, have diverted resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy and may have impacted our ability to attract and retain customers, employees and vendors. \n\n47\n\n**MANAGEMENT**\n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our executive officers and directors as of the date of this prospectus. \n\n**Name** |  **Age** |  **Position/Title**  \n---|---|---  \nBasil Wilson |  45 |  Chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer  \nLili Jiang  |  31 |  Chief Financial Officer  \nJehan Zeb Khan |  34 |  Director  \nBiao (Luke) Lu |  46 |  Chief Artistic Officer  \nYingxian Xiang |  48 |  Independent director  \nHung-Jen Kuo |  47 |  Independent director  \nLong Yi |  44 |  Independent director  \n  \n**Biography**\n\n**_Basil Wilson_**\n\nMr. Wilson served as CEO of Century Dragon Entertainment Development Co., Ltd. from 2016 to March 2021.

All members of our Audit Committee satisfy the independence standards promulgated by the SEC and by Nasdaq as such standards apply specifically to members of audit committees. \n\nOur Audit Committee performs several functions, including: \n\n● |  selecting our independent auditors and pre-approving all auditing and non-auditing services permitted to be performed by our independent auditors;  \n---|---  \n● |  reviewing with our independent auditors any audit problems or difficulties and management’s response;  \n---|---  \n● |  reviewing and approving all proposed related-party transactions, as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S- K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended;  \n---|---  \n● |  discussing the annual audited financial statements with management and our independent auditors;  \n---|---  \n● |  reviewing major issues as to the adequacy of our internal controls and any special audit steps adopted in light of significant internal control deficiencies;  \n---|---  \n● |  annually reviewing and reassessing the adequacy of our audit committee charter;  \n---|---  \n● |  meeting separately and periodically with management and our independent auditors;  \n---|---  \n● |  reporting to the Board; and  \n---|---  \n● |  such other matters that are specifically delegated to our audit committee by the Board from time to time.  \n---|---  \n  \n_Compensation Committee_\n\nLong Yi, Hung-Jen Kuo and Yingxian Xiang are members of our Compensation Committee, and Yingxian Xiang serves the chairwoman. All members of our Compensation Committee are qualified as independent under the current definition promulgated by Nasdaq. The Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other things: \n\n● |  reviewing and approving the total compensation package for our senior executives; and  \n---|---  \n● |  reviewing periodically, and approving, any long-term incentive compensation or equity plans, programs or similar arrangements, annual bonuses, employee pension and welfare benefit plans.  \n---|---  \n  \n52\n\n_Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee_\n\nLong Yi, Hung-Jen Kuo and Yingxian Xiang are members of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Hung-Jen Kuo is the chairman. All members of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are qualified as independent under the current definition promulgated by Nasdaq. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things: \n\n● |  identify qualified individuals to become Board members, consistent with criteria approved by the Board, and to recommend that the Board select, the director nominees for the next annual meeting of shareholders;  \n---|---  \n● |  develop and recommend to the Board a set of corporate governance guidelines applicable to the Company; and  \n---|---  \n● |  to oversee the evaluation of the Board and management.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Corporate Governance**\n\nOther than as described in this section, our corporate governance practices do not differ from those followed by domestic companies listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635 generally provides that shareholder approval is required of U.S. domestic companies listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market prior to issuance (or potential issuance) of securities (i) equaling 20% or more of the company’s common stock or voting power for less than the greater of market or book value (ii) resulting in a change of control of the company; and (iii) which is being issued pursuant to a stock option or purchase plan to be established or materially amended or other equity compensation arrangement made or materially amended. Notwithstanding this general requirement, NASDAQ Listing Rule 5615(a)(3)(A) permits foreign private issuers to follow their home country practice rather than these shareholder approval requirements. The Cayman Islands do not require shareholder approval prior to any of the foregoing types of issuances. The Company, therefore, is not required to obtain such shareholder approval prior to entering into a transaction with the potential to issue securities as described above. The Board of Directors of the Company has elected to follow the Company’s home country rules as to such issuances and will not be required to seek shareholder approval prior to entering into such a transaction. \n\n53\n\n**PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS**\n\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares as of the date of this prospectus for: \n\n● |  each beneficial owner of 5% or more of our outstanding ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n● |  each of our directors and executive officers; and  \n● |  all of our directors and executive officers as a group.  \n  \nBeneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities and include ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of options that are immediately exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of the date hereof. \n\nExcept as otherwise indicated, all of the shares reflected in the table are ordinary shares and all persons listed below have sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares beneficially owned by them, subject to applicable community property laws.

The Telecommunications Regulations divided the telecommunications services into two categories, namely “infrastructure telecommunications services” and “value-added telecommunications services.” Pursuant to the Telecommunications Regulations, operators of value-added telecommunications services, or VATS, must first obtain a Value-added Telecommunications Business Operating License, or VATS License, from the MIIT, or its provincial level counterparts. On July 3, 2017, the MIIT promulgated the Administrative Measures on Telecommunications Business Operating Licenses, which set forth more specific provisions regarding the types of licenses required to operate VATS, the qualifications and procedures for obtaining such licenses and the administration and supervision of such licenses. \n\nThe Amended Classified Catalog of Telecommunications Services (2015 Version), or the Amended 2016 MIIT Catalog, which took effect on June 6, 2019, defines information services as “the information services provided for users through public communications networks or internet by means of information gathering, development, processing and the construction of the information platform.” Moreover, information services continue to be classified as a category of VATS and are clarified to include information release and delivery services, information search and query services, information community platform services, information real-time interactive services, and information protection and processing services under the Amended 2016 MIIT Catalog. The Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services, or ICP Measures, promulgated by the PRC State Council on September 25, 2000 and most recently amended on January 8, 2011, set forth more specific rules on the provision of internet information services. According to ICP Measures, any company that engages in the provision of commercial internet information services shall obtain a sub-category VATS License for Internet Information Services, or ICP License, from the relevant government authorities before providing any commercial internet information services within the PRC. Pursuant to the above-mentioned regulations, “commercial internet information services” generally refer to provision of specific information content, online advertising, web page construction and other online application services through internet for profit making purpose. \n\nIn addition to the Telecommunications Regulations and the other regulations discussed above, the provision of commercial internet information services on mobile internet applications is regulated by the Administrative Provisions on Mobile Internet Applications Information Services, which was promulgated by Cyberspace Administration of China, or the CAC, on June 28, 2016 and came into effect on August 1, 2016. The providers of mobile internet applications are subject to requirements under these provisions, including acquiring the qualifications and complying with other requirements provided by laws and regulations and being responsible for information security. \n\n**_Regulation Related to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs_**\n\nTo regulate the provision of audio-visual program services to the public via the internet, including through mobile networks, within the territory of the PRC, the State Administration of Press Publication Radio Film and Television, or the SAPPRFT (currently known as National Radio and Television Administration), and the MIIT jointly promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Internet Audio-Visual Program Service, or the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, on December 20, 2007, which came into effect on January 31, 2008 and was last amended on August 28, 2015. Under the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, “online audio-visual program services” is defined as activities of producing, redacting and integrating audio-visual programs, providing them to the general public via internet, and providing service for other people to upload and transmit audio-visual programs, and providers of online audio-visual program services are required to obtain a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs issued by the SAPPRFT, or complete certain registration procedures with the SAPPRFT. In general, providers of online audio-visual program services must be either state-owned or state-controlled entities, and the business to be carried out by such providers must satisfy the overall planning and guidance catalog for internet audio-visual program service determined by the SAPPRFT. \n\n57\n\nOn May 21, 2008, SAPPRFT issued a Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Application and Approval of License for the Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs, as amended on August 28, 2015, which sets out detailed provisions concerning the application and approval process regarding the License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs. According to the above regulations, providers of internet audio-visual program services that engaged in such services prior to the promulgation of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions are eligible to apply for the license so long as those providers did not violate the relevant laws and regulations in the past or their violation of the laws and regulations is minor in scope and can be rectified in a timely manner and they have no records of violation during the last three months prior to the promulgation of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions. \n\nOn March 30, 2009, SAPPRFT promulgated the Notice on Strengthening the Administration of the Content of Internet Audio-Visual Programs, which reiterates the pre-approval requirements for the audio-visual programs transmitted via the internet, including through mobile networks, where applicable, and prohibits certain types of internet audio-visual programs containing violence, pornography, gambling, terrorism, superstition or other similarly prohibited elements. \n\nOn March 10, 2017, SAPPRFT issued the Provisional Implementation of the Tentative Categories of Internet Audio-Visual Program Services, or the Categories, which revised the previous version issued on March 17, 2010. According to the Categories, there are four categories of internet audio and video programs services which are further divided into seventeen sub-categories. The third sub-category to the second category covers the making and editing of certain specialized audio-visual programs concerning, among other things, educational content, and broadcasting such content to the general public online. \n\nOn March 16, 2018, the SAPPRFT promulgated the Notice on Further Regulating the Transmission Order of Internet Audio-Visual Program Services, providing that the classic literary works, radio, film and television programs, internet original audio-visual programs shall not be re-edited, re-dubbed, re-subtitled or partly captured and consolidated as a new program without authorizations and providers of internet audio-visual program services shall strictly manage and supervise such re-edited programs uploaded by the internet users and shall not provide any transmission channel for those internet audio-visual programs which have political orientation issues, copyright issues or content issues. \n\n**_Regulation Related to Internet Live Streaming Services_**\n\nOn September 2, 2016, the SAPPRFT promulgated the Notice on Strengthening the Administration of Live Streaming Services of Internet Audio-Visual Program, which provides that any entity that intends to engage in live audio-visual broadcasting of major political, military, economic, social, cultural or sport events or activities, or live audio-visual broadcasting of general social or cultural group activities, general sporting events or other organizational events, must obtain a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs with a permitted operation scope covering the above business activities. Any entity or individual without qualification is prohibited from broadcasting live audio-visual programs involving news, variety shows, sports, interviews, commentary or other forms of programs through any online live-streaming platform or online live broadcasting booth, nor are they permitted to start a live broadcasting channel for any audio-visual programs. In addition, any entity without such license shall not operate audio-visual live streaming business and the live streaming programs provided by the qualified company shall not contain any content forbidden by laws and regulations. \n\nOn November 4, 2016, the CAC promulgated the Provisions on the Administration of Internet Live Streaming Services, or the Internet Live Streaming Provisions, effective from December 1, 2016. Under the Internet Live Stream Provisions, “internet live streaming service” is defined as the activities of continuously releasing real-time information to the public on internet in such forms as videos, audios, images and texts and the “internet live streaming service provider” is defined thereunder as an operator of the platform providing internet live streaming platform services. The Internet Live Streaming Provisions provide that internet live streaming service providers shall examine and verify the identity information of internet live-streaming issuers and file the identity information of the issuers with local counterparts of the CAC. \n\nOn July 12, 2017, the CAC issued a Notice on Development of the Filing Work for Enterprises Providing Internet Live Streaming Services, which provides that all the companies providing internet live streaming services shall file with the local authority since July 15, 2017, otherwise the CAC or its local counterparts may impose administrative sanctions on such companies. \n\n58\n\nPursuant to the Circular on Tightening the Administration of Internet Live-Streaming Services jointly issued by the MIIT, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, or the MCOT, and several other government agencies on August 1, 2018, live streaming services providers are required to file with the local public security authority within 30 days after it commences the service online. \n\n**_Regulation Related to Production and Distribution of Radio and Television Programs_**\n\nOn 19 July 2004, SAPPRFT promulgated the Administrative Measures on the Production and Operation of Radio and Television Programs, or the Radio and TV Programs Measures, which became effective on 20 August 2004 and were amended on August 28, 2015 and October 31, 2018. The Radio and TV Programs Measures are applicable for establishing institutions that produce and distribute radio and television programs or for the production of radio and television programs like programs with a special topic, column programs, variety shows, animated cartoons, radio plays and television dramas and for activities like transactions and agency transactions of program copyrights. Pursuant to the Radio and TV Programs Measures, any entity that intends to produce or operate radio or television programs must first obtain the Permit for Production and Operation of Radio and TV Programs from SAPPRFT or its local branches. \n\n**_Regulation Related to Internet Culture Activities_**\n\nOn May 10, 2003, the Ministry of Culture, or MOC (currently known as the MCOT), promulgated the Interim Administrative Provisions on Internet Culture, or the Internet Culture Provisions, which became effective on July 1, 2003 and was amended on February 17, 2011 and December 15, 2017. The Internet Culture Provisions require internet information services providers engaging in commercial “internet culture activities” to obtain an Internet Culture Business Operating License from the MOC. “Internet cultural activity” is defined under the Internet Culture Provisions as an act of provision of internet cultural products and related services, which includes (i) the production, duplication, importation, and broadcasting of the internet cultural products; (ii) the online dissemination whereby cultural products are posted on the internet or transmitted via the internet to end-users, such as computers, fixed-line telephones, mobile phones, television sets and games machines, for online users’ browsing, use or downloading; and (iii) the exhibition and competition of the internet cultural products. In addition, “internet cultural products” is defined under the Internet Culture Provisions as cultural products produced, broadcast and disseminated via the internet, which mainly include internet cultural products especially produced for the internet, such as online music entertainment, online games, online shows and plays (programs), online performances, online works of art and online cartoons, and internet cultural products produced from cultural products such as music entertainment, games, shows and plays (programs), performances, works of art, and cartoons through certain techniques and duplicating those to internet for dissemination. \n\nOn May 14, 2019, the General Office of MOC promulgated the Notice on Adjusting the Scope of Internet Culture Business Operating License and Further Standardize the Approval Work, which provides that online music, online shows and plays, online performances, online works of art, online cartoons, displays and games are the activities that fall in the scope of Internet Culture Business Operating License, and further clarifies that educational live streaming activities are not online performances. \n\n**_Regulation Related to Online Publishing_**\n\nOn February 4, 2016, the SAPPRFT (currently reformed into the State Administration of Press and Publication (National Copyright Bureau) under the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China) and the MIIT jointly issued the Administrative Provisions on Online Publishing Services, or the Online Publishing Provisions, which came into effect on March 10, 2016. Under the Online Publishing Provisions, any entity providing online publishing services shall obtain an Online Publishing Services Permit. “Online publishing services” refer to the provision of online publications to the public through information networks; and “online publications” refer to digital works with publishing features such as having been edited, produced or processed and are available to the public through information networks, including: (i) written works, pictures, maps, games, cartoons, audio/video reading materials and other original digital works containing useful knowledge or ideas in the field of literature, art, science or other fields; (ii) digital works of which the content is identical to that of any published book, newspaper, periodical, audio/video product, electronic publication or the like; (iii) network literature databases or other digital works, derived from any of the aforesaid works by selection, arrangement, collection or other means; and (iv) other types of digital works as may be determined by the SAPPRFT. \n\n59\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, there are no explicit interpretation from the governmental authorities or prevailing enforcement practice deeming the provision of our educational content to our students through our online platform as “online publishing” which requires an Online Publishing Service Permit. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the local PRC authorities would adopt a different practice. In addition, it remains uncertain whether the PRC governmental authorities would issue more explicit interpretation and rules or promulgate new laws and regulations. \n\n**_Regulation Related to Internet Information Security and Privacy Protection_**\n\nThe PRC Constitution states that the PRC laws protect the freedom and privacy of communications of citizens and prohibit infringement of such rights. PRC governmental authorities have enacted laws and regulations on internet information security and protection of personal information from any abuse or unauthorized disclosure. The Decisions on Maintaining Internet Security which was enacted by the Standing Committee of the PRC National People’s Congress, or the SCNPC on December 28, 2000 and amended on August 27, 2009, may subject violators to criminal punishment in the PRC for any effort to: (i) gain improper entry into a computer or system of strategic importance; (ii) disseminate politically disruptive information; (iii) leak state secrets; (iv) spread false commercial information; or (v) infringe intellectual property rights. The Ministry of Public Security has promulgated measures that prohibit use of the internet in ways which, among other things, result in a leakage of state secrets or a spread of socially destabilizing content. If an information service provider violates these measures, the Ministry of Public Security and the local security bureaus may revoke its operating license and shut down its websites. \n\nPursuant to the Decision on Strengthening the Protection of Online Information issued by the SCNPC on December 28, 2012, and the Order for the Protection of Telecommunication and Internet User Personal Information issued by the MIIT on July 16, 2013, any collection and use of user personal information must be subject to the consent of the user, abide by the principles of legality, rationality and necessity and be within the specified purposes, methods and scopes. “Personal information” is defined as information that identifies a citizen, the time or location for his/her use of telecommunication and internet services or involves privacy of any citizen such as his/her birth date, ID card number, and address. An internet information service provider must also keep information collected strictly confidential, and is further prohibited from divulging, tampering or destroying of any such information, or selling or providing such information to other parties. Any violation of the above decision or order may subject the internet information service provider to warnings, fines, confiscation of illegal gains, revocation of licenses, cancelation of filings, closedown of websites or even criminal liabilities. \n\nPursuant to the Notice of the Supreme People’s Court, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security on Legally Punishing Criminal Activities Infringing upon the Personal Information of Citizens, issued in 2013, and the Interpretation of the Supreme People’s Court and the Supreme People’s Procuratorate on Several Issues regarding Legal Application in Criminal Cases Infringing upon the Personal Information of Citizens, which was issued on May 8, 2017 and took effect on June 1, 2017, the following activities may constitute the crime of infringing upon a citizen’s personal information:(i) providing a citizen’s personal information to specified persons or releasing a citizen’s personal information online or through other methods in violation of relevant national provisions; (ii) providing legitimately collected information relating to a citizen to others without such citizen’s consent (unless the information is processed, not traceable to a specific person and not recoverable); (iii) collecting a citizen’s personal information in violation of applicable rules and regulations when performing a duty or providing services; or (iv) collecting a citizen’s personal information by purchasing, accepting or exchanging such information in violation of applicable rules and regulations. \n\nPursuant to the Ninth Amendment to the Criminal Law issued by the SCNPC in August 2015, which became effective in November 2015, any person or entity that fails to fulfill the obligations related to internet information security administration as required by applicable laws and refuses to rectify upon orders is subject to criminal penalty for the result of (i) any dissemination of illegal information in large scale; (ii) any severe effect due to the leakage of the client’s information; (iii) any serious loss of criminal evidence; or (iv) other severe situation, and any individual or entity that (i) sells or provides personal information to others in a way violating the applicable law, or (ii) steals or illegally obtain any personal information is subject to criminal penalty in severe situation. \n\n60\n\nPursuant to the PRC Cyber Security Law issued by the SCNPC on November 7, 2016, effective as of June 1, 2017, “personal information” refers to all kinds of information recorded by electronic or otherwise that can be used to independently identify or be combined with other information to identify individuals’ personal information including but not limited to: individuals’ names, dates of birth, ID numbers, biologically identified personal information, addresses and telephone numbers, etc. The Cyber Security Law also provides that: (i) to collect and use personal information, network operators shall follow the principles of legitimacy, rightfulness and necessity, disclose rules of data collection and use, clearly express the purposes, means and scope of collecting and using the information, and obtain the consent of the persons whose data is gathered; (ii) network operators shall neither gather personal information unrelated to the services they provide, nor gather or use personal information in violation of the provisions of laws and administrative regulations or the scopes of consent given by the persons whose data is gathered; and shall dispose of personal information they have saved in accordance with the provisions of laws and administrative regulations and agreements reached with users; (iii) network operators shall not divulge, tamper with or damage the personal information they have collected, and shall not provide the personal information to others without the consent of the persons whose data is collected. However, if the information has been processed and cannot be recovered and thus it is impossible to match such information with specific persons, such circumstance is an exception. \n\nPursuant to the Provisions on Internet Security Supervision and Inspection by Public Security Organs, which was promulgated by the Ministry of Public Security on September 15, 2018 and became effective on November 1, 2018, the public security departments are authorized to carry out internet security supervision and inspection of the internet service providers from the following aspects, among others: (i) whether the service providers have completed the recordation formalities for online entities, and filed the basic information on and the changes of the accessing entities and users; (ii) whether they have established and implemented the cybersecurity management system and protocols, and appointed the persons responsible for cybersecurity; (iii) whether the technical measures for recording and retaining users’ registration information and weblog data are in place according to the law; (iv) whether they have taken technical measures to prevent computer viruses, network attacks and network intrusion; (v) whether they have adopted preventive measures to tackle the information that is prohibited to be issued or transmitted by the laws and administrative regulations in the public information services; (vi) whether they provide technical support and assistance as required by laws to public security departments to safeguard national security and prevent and investigate on terrorist activities and criminal activities; and (vii) whether they have fulfilled the obligations of the grade-based cybersecurity protection and other obligations prescribed by the laws and administrative regulations. In particular, public security departments shall also carry out supervision and inspection on whether an internet service provider has taken required measures to manage information published by users, adopted proper measures to handle the published or transmitted information that is prohibited to be published or transmitted, and kept the relevant records. \n\nIn addition, the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, the MIIT, the Ministry of Public Security, and the SAMR jointly issued an Announcement of Launching Special Crackdown Against Illegal Collection and Use of Personal Information by Apps on January 23, 2019 to implement special rectification works against mobile Apps that collect and use personal information in violation of applicable laws and regulations, where business operators are prohibited from collecting personal information irrelevant to their services, or forcing users to give authorization in disguised manner. On November 28, 2019, the National Internet Information Office, the MIIT, the Ministry of Public Security and the SAMR further jointly issued a notice to classify and identify illegal collection and use of personal information. \n\nOn August 22, 2019, the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission issued the Provisions on the Cyber Protection of Children’s Personal Information, which took effect on October 1, 2019. The Provisions on the Cyber Protection of Children’s Personal Information apply to the collection, storage, use, transfer and disclosure of the personal information of children under the age of 14 via the internet. The Provisions on the Cyber Protection of Children’s Personal Information require that network operators shall establish special rules and user agreements for protection of personal information for children under the age of 14, inform their guardians in a noticeable and clear manner, and shall obtain the consent of their guardians. When obtaining the consent of their guardians, network operators shall explicitly disclose several matters, including, without limitation, the purpose, method and scope of collection, storage, use, transfer and disclosure of such personal information, and methods for correcting and deleting such personal information. Provisions on the Cyber Protection of Children’s Personal Information also require that when collecting, storing, using, transferring and disclosing such personal information, network operators shall comply with certain regulatory requirements, including, without limitation, that network operators shall designate specific personnel to take charge of the protection of such personal information and shall strictly grant information access authorization for their staff to such personal information under the principle of minimal authorization. \n\n**Property, Plants and Equipment**\n\nOur U.S. executive offices are located at 800 3rd Ave, Suite 2800, New York NY 10022, where we lease premises of a share office, with lease term of one year until May 2021. We lease offices in Shenzhen, China, with an aggregate of approximately 2,153 square feet, to support our daily operations, with lease term of two years until August 2022. We lease all of the facilities that we currently occupy from independent third parties. \n\n**Legal Proceedings**\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may become a party to various legal actions. These claims and proceedings listed below relate to or arise from, commercial disputes, labor contract complaints and sales contract complaints in connection with the Company’s former officers, Mr. Xianfu Han, and Mr. Weili He, and former Variable Interest Entity, Beijing XinAo Concrete Group (\"Xin Ao”). Mr. Han and Mr. He resigned on March 28, 2019. In addition, on May 6, 2020, the Company completed the disposition of Xin Ao and consequently, Mr. Han and Mr. He assumed all of the assets and liabilities of Xin Ao. As a result, the Company believes that it currently does not face any material pending legal proceedings. \n\n61\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF ORDINARY SHARES**\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, we are authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 ordinary shares of $0.001 par value per share.\n\nThe following are summaries of the material provisions of our Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company, as amended, insofar as they relate to the material terms of our ordinary shares. Copies of our Memorandum and Articles of Association are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.\n\n**Ordinary shares**\n\n**_Ordinary Shares_**\n\nThe following are summaries of material provisions of our Memorandum and Articles, corporate governance policies and the Companies Act insofar as they relate to the material terms of our Ordinary Shares.\n\n**_Objects of Our Company_**\n\nUnder our Memorandum and Articles, the objects of our Company are unrestricted and we have the full power and authority to carry out any object not prohibited by the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\n**_Share Capital_**\n\nThe holders of our Ordinary Shares are entitled to one vote for each such share held and shall be entitled to notice of any shareholders’ meeting, and, subject to the terms of Memorandum and Articles, to vote thereat.\n\n**_Dividends_**\n\nThe holders of our Ordinary Shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by our Board of Directors subject to the Companies Act and to our Memorandum and Articles.\n\n**_Voting Rights_**\n\nIn respect of all matters subject to a shareholders’ vote, each Ordinary Share is entitled to one vote. Voting at any shareholders’ meeting is by show of hands unless a poll is demanded by the chairman or persons holding certain amounts of shares as set forth in the Memorandum and Articles. Actions that may be taken at a general meeting also may be taken by a unanimous resolution of the shareholders in writing.\n\nNo business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of members is present at the time when the meeting proceeds to business; two members present in person or by proxy shall be a quorum provided always that if the Company has one member of record the quorum shall be that one member present in person or by proxy. An ordinary resolution to be passed at a general meeting requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes cast.\n\nA special resolution of members is required to change the name of the Company, approve a merger, wind up the Company, amend the Memorandum and Articles and reduce the share capital.\n\n**_Transfer of Ordinary Shares_**\n\nSubject to the restrictions set out below, any of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his, its or her Ordinary Shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or any other form approved by our Board of Directors or in a form prescribed by the stock exchange on which our shares are then listed.\n\nOur Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, decline to register any transfer of Ordinary Shares whether or not it is fully paid up to the total consideration paid for such shares. Our directors may also decline to register any transfer of Ordinary Shares if (a) the instrument of transfer is not accompanied by the certificate covering the shares to which it relates or any other evidence as our Board of Directors may reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor to, or his/her right to transfer the shares; or (b) the instrument of transfer is in respect of more than one class of shares.\n\n62\n\nIf our directors refuse to register a transfer, they shall, within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to the transferee notice of such refusal.\n\nThe registration of transfers may be suspended and the register closed at such times and for such periods as our Board of Directors may from time to time determine, provided, however, that the registration of transfers shall not be suspended nor the register closed for more than 30 days in any year.\n\n**_Winding-Up/Liquidation_**\n\nOn a return of capital on winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares), a liquidator may be appointed to determine how to distribute the assets among the holders of the Ordinary Shares. If our assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay all of the paid-up capital, the assets will be distributed so that the losses are borne by our shareholders proportionately; a similar basis will be employed if the assets are more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital at the commencement of the winding up.\n\n**_Calls on Ordinary Shares and Forfeiture of Ordinary Shares_**\n\nOur Board of Directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their Ordinary Shares in a notice served to such shareholders at least 14 days prior to the specified time and place of payment. The shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid on the specified time are subject to forfeiture.\n\n**_Redemption of Shares_**\n\nWe may issue shares on terms that are subject to redemption, at our option or at the option of the holders, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by our Board of Directors.\n\n**_Inspection of Books and Records_**\n\nDirectors shall from time to time determine whether and to what extent and at what times and places and under what conditions or regulations the accounts and books of the Company or any of them shall be open to the inspection of members not being Directors and no member (not being a Director) shall have any right of inspecting any account or book or document of the Company except as conferred by Companies Act or authorized by the Directors or by the Company in a general meeting. However, the Directors shall from time to time cause to be prepared and to be laid before the Company in a general meeting, profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, group accounts (if any) and such other reports and accounts as may be required by Companies Act. (See “Where You Can Find More Information”)\n\n**_Issuance of Additional Shares_**\n\nOur Memorandum and Articles authorize our Board of Directors to issue additional Ordinary Shares from time to time as our Board of Directors shall determine, to the extent there are available authorized but unissued shares.\n\nOur Memorandum and Articles also authorizes our Board of Directors to issue all or any part of its capital with or without preference, priority or special privilege or subject to any restriction.\n\n63\n\n**_Anti-Takeover Provisions_**\n\nSome provisions of our Memorandum and Articles may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company or management that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that:\n\n● | authorize our Board of Directors to issue ordinary shares with preference rights in one or more series and to designate the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such ordinary shares with preference rights without any further vote or action by our shareholders (subject to variation of rights of shares provisions in our Memorandum and Articles); and  \n---|---  \n● | limit the ability of shareholders to requisition and convene general meetings of shareholders. Our Memorandum and Articles allow our shareholders holding shares representing in aggregate not less than one-fourth of our paid up share capital (as to the total consideration paid for such shares) in issue to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders, in which case our directors are obliged to call such meeting and to put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting.  \n  \nHowever, under Cayman Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under our Memorandum and Articles for a proper purpose and for what they believe in good faith to be in the best interests of our Company.\n\n**_General Meetings of Shareholders and Shareholder Proposals_**\n\nOur shareholders’ general meetings may be held in such place within or outside the Cayman Islands as our Board of Directors considers appropriate. \n\nAs a Cayman Islands exempted company, we are not obliged by the Companies Law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings. The directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting. \n\nShareholders’ general meetings and any other general meetings of our shareholders may be convened by a majority of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors shall give not less than seven days’ written notice of a shareholders’ meeting to those persons whose names appear as members in our register of members on the date the notice is given (or on any other date determined by our directors to be the record date for such meeting) and who are entitled to vote at the meeting. \n\nCayman Islands law provides shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting, and does not provide shareholders with any right to put any proposal before a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in a company’s articles of association. Our Memorandum and Articles allow our shareholders holding shares representing in aggregate not less than ten percent of our paid up share capital (as to the total consideration paid for such shares) in issue to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders, in which case our directors are obliged to call such meeting and to put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting; otherwise, our Memorandum and Articles do not provide our shareholders with any right to put any proposals before annual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings not called by such shareholders. \n\n64\n\n**_Exempted Company_**\n\nWe are an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Law. The Companies Law distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. A Cayman Islands exempted company: \n\n● |  is a company that conducts its business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands;  \n---|---  \n● |  is exempted from certain requirements of the Companies Law, including the filing an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies or the Immigration Board;  \n● |  does not have to make its register of members open for inspection;  \n● |  does not have to hold an annual general meeting;  \n---|---  \n● |  may issue negotiable or bearer shares or shares with no par value (subject to the provisions of the Companies Law);  \n● |  may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for 20 years in the first instance); and  \n● |  may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands.  \n  \n“Limited liability” means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the shareholder on the shares of the company (except in exceptional circumstances, such as involving fraud, the establishment of an agency relationship or an illegal or improper purpose or other circumstances in which a court may be prepared to pierce or lift the corporate veil). \n\n**_Register of Members_**\n\nUnder Cayman Islands law, we must keep a register of members and there should be entered therein: \n\n● |  the names and addresses of the members, a statement of the shares held by each member, and of the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid, on the shares of each member;  \n---|---  \n● |  the date on which the name of any person was entered on the register as a member; and  \n● |  the date on which any person ceased to be a member.  \n  \nUnder Cayman Islands law, the register of members of our Company is prima facie evidence of the matters set out therein (i.e. the register of members will raise a presumption of fact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted) and a member registered in the register of members is deemed as a matter of Cayman Islands law to have legal title to the shares as set against its name in the register of members. Once our register of members has been updated, the shareholders recorded in the register of members are deemed to have legal title to the shares set against their name. \n\nIf the name of any person is incorrectly entered in, or omitted from, our register of members, or if there is any default or unnecessary delay in entering on the register the fact of any person having ceased to be a member of our Company, the person or member aggrieved (or any member of our Company or our Company itself) may apply to the Cayman Islands Grand Court for an order that the register be rectified, and the Court may either refuse such application or it may, if satisfied of the justice of the case, make an order for the rectification of the register. \n\n65\n\n**_Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability_**\n\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our Memorandum and Articles require us to indemnify our officers and directors for actions, proceedings, claims, losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (“Indemnified Losses”) incurred in their capacities as such unless such Indemnified Losses arise from dishonesty of such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation. \n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. \n\n**Warrants**\n\nThe following summary of certain terms and provisions of the warrants that are being offered hereby is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the provisions of the warrants, the form of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Prospective investors should carefully review the terms and provisions of the form of warrant for a complete description of the terms and conditions of the warrants.\n\n_Exercise Price and Duration._ Each share exercisable pursuant to the warrants will have an exercise price per share of US$1.34. The warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance, and at any time thereafter up to the third anniversary of the issuance date. The exercise price is subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting our Class A ordinary share and also upon any distributions of assets, including cash, stock or other property to our shareholders. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. A warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares. As a result, you must purchase Units in multiples of two in order to obtain full value from the fractional interest.\n\n_Exercisability._ The warrants will be exercisable, at the option of each holder, in whole or in part by delivering to us a duly executed exercise notice and by payment in full in immediately available funds for the number of Class A ordinary shares purchased upon such exercise.\n\n_Cashless Exercise_. If at the third-month anniversary of the issuance date, there is no effective registration statement registering, or the prospectus contained therein is not available for the issuance of the ordinary shares underlying the warrants, then the warrants may also be exercised, in whole or in part, at such time by means of a cashless exercise, in which case the holder would receive upon such exercise the net number of ordinary shares determined according to the formula set forth in the warrant.\n\n_Exercise Limitation._ A holder will not have the right to exercise any portion of the warrant if the holder (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% (or 9.99% upon the request of the holder) of the number of ordinary shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the warrants. However, any holder may increase or decrease such percentage, provided that any increase will not be effective until the 61st day after such election.\n\n_Transferability_. Subject to applicable laws, the warrants may be offered for sale, sold, transferred or assigned without our consent.\n\n_Fractional Shares._ No fractional ordinary shares will be issued upon the exercise of the warrants. A warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares.\n\n_Trading Market_. There is no established public trading market for the warrants being issued in this offering, and we do not expect a market to develop. We do not intend to apply for listing of the warrants on any securities exchange or other nationally recognized trading system. Without an active trading market, the liquidity of the warrants will be limited.\n\n66\n\n**MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN U.S. CORPORATE LAW AND CAYMAN ISLANDS CORPORATE LAW**\n\nThe Companies Act is modeled after that of English law but does not follow many recent English law statutory enactments. In addition, the Companies Act differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the significant differences between the provisions of the Companies Act applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the State of Delaware.\n\n**_Mergers and Similar Arrangements_**. A merger of two or more constituent companies under Cayman Islands law requires a plan of merger or consolidation to be approved by the directors of each constituent company and authorization by (a) a special resolution of the shareholders and (b) such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company’s articles of association.\n\nA merger between a Cayman Islands parent company and its Cayman Islands subsidiary or subsidiaries does not require authorization by a resolution of shareholders of that Cayman Islands subsidiary if a copy of the plan of merger is given to every member of that Cayman Islands subsidiary to be merged unless that member agrees otherwise. For this purpose, a subsidiary is a company of which at least ninety percent (90%) of the issued shares entitled to vote are owned by the parent company. However, it is noted that the Company’s Articles provide that approval of a special resolution of shareholders is required.\n\nThe consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest over a constituent company is required unless this requirement is waived by a court in the Cayman Islands.\n\nSave in certain circumstances, a dissentient shareholder of a Cayman constituent company is entitled to payment of the fair value of his shares upon dissenting to a merger or consolidation. The exercise of appraisal rights will preclude the exercise of any other rights save for the right to seek relief on the grounds that the merger or consolidation is void or unlawful.\n\nIn addition, there are statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, provided that the arrangement is approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made, and who must in addition represent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meetings, convened for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not to be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that:\n\n● | the statutory provisions as to the required majority vote have been met;  \n---|---  \n● | the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the statutory majority are acting bona fide without coercion of the minority to promote interests adverse to those of the class;  \n---|---  \n● | the arrangement is such that may be reasonably approved by an intelligent and honest man of that class acting in respect of his interest; and  \n---|---  \n● | the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Act.  \n---|---  \n  \nWhen a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90.0% of the shares within four months, the offeror may, within a two-month period commencing on the expiration of such four month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands but this is unlikely to succeed in the case of an offer which has been so approved unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith or collusion.\n\nIf an arrangement and reconstruction is thus approved, the dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights, which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of Delaware corporations, providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares.\n\n67\n\n**_Shareholders’ Suits._** In principle, we will normally be the proper plaintiff and as a general rule a derivative action may not be brought by a minority shareholder. However, based on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority in the Cayman Islands, there are exceptions to the foregoing principle, including when:\n\n● | a company acts or proposes to act illegally or ultra vires;  \n---|---  \n● | the act complained of, although not ultra vires, could only be effected duly if authorized by more than a simple majority vote that has not been obtained; and  \n---|---  \n● | those who control the company are perpetrating a “fraud on the minority.”  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability_**. Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our current memorandum and articles of association permit indemnification of officers and directors for losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred in their capacities as such unless such losses or damages arise from dishonesty of such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers that provide such persons with additional indemnification beyond that provided in our current memorandum and articles of association.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\n\n**_Directors’ Fiduciary Duties_** _._ Under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director acts in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He must not use his corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, the director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.\n\nAs a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and therefore it is considered that he or she owes the following duties to the company — a duty to act bona fide in the best interests of the company, a duty not to make a profit based on his or her position as director (unless the company permits him or her to do so) and a duty not to put himself or herself in a position where the interests of the company conflict with his or her personal interest or his or her duty to a third party. A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his or her duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his or her knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands.\n\n**_Shareholder Action by Written Consent_**. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written consent by amendment to its certificate of incorporation. Cayman Islands law and our current articles of association provide that shareholders may approve corporate matters by way of a unanimous written resolution signed by or on behalf of each shareholder who would have been entitled to vote on such matter at a general meeting without a meeting being held.\n\n68\n\n**_Shareholder Proposals_**. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, provided it complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized to do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings.\n\nCayman Islands law does not provide shareholders any right to put proposals before a meeting or requisition a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in articles of association. Our current articles of association allow our shareholders holding not less than one-fourth of all voting power of our share capital in issue to requisition a shareholder’s meeting. Other than this right to requisition a shareholders’ meeting, our current articles of association do not provide our shareholders other right to put proposal before a meeting. As a Cayman Islands exempted company, we are not obliged by law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings.\n\n**_Cumulative Voting._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation’s certificate of incorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since it permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder’s voting power with respect to electing such director. There are no prohibitions in relation to cumulative voting under the laws of the Cayman Islands but our current articles of association do not provide for cumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation.\n\n**_Removal of Directors._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our current articles of association, directors may be removed with or without cause, by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders.\n\n**_Transactions with Interested Shareholders._** The Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware corporations whereby, unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an “interested shareholder” for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder generally is a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target’s outstanding voting share within the past three years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target’s board of directors.\n\nCayman Islands law has no comparable statute. As a result, we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the Delaware business combination statute. However, although Cayman Islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders, it does provide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and not with the effect of constituting a fraud on the minority shareholders.\n\n**_Dissolution; Winding up._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution must be approved by shareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board. Under Cayman Islands law, a company may be wound up by either an order of the courts of the Cayman Islands or by a special resolution of its members or, if the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, by an ordinary resolution of its members. The court has authority to order winding up in a number of specified circumstances including where it is, in the opinion of the court, just and equitable to do so. Under the Companies Act and our current articles of association, our company may be dissolved, liquidated or wound up by a special resolution of our shareholders.\n\n69\n\n**_Variation of Rights of Shares._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of such class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under Cayman Islands law and our current articles of association, if our share capital is divided into more than one class of shares, we may vary the rights attached to any class with the written consent of the holders of two-thirds of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of such holders of the shares of that class as may be present at a general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.\n\n**_Amendment of Governing Documents._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation’s governing documents may be amended with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. As permitted by Cayman Islands law, our current memorandum and articles of association may only be amended with a special resolution of our shareholders.\n\n**_Rights of Non-resident or Foreign Shareholders._** There are no limitations imposed by our post-offering amended and restated memorandum and articles of association on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on our shares. In addition, there are no provisions in our current memorandum and articles of association governing the ownership threshold above which shareholder ownership must be disclosed.\n\n**_Cayman Islands Data Protection_**. We have certain duties under the Cayman Islands Data Protection Act, 2017 (“**DPA** ”) of the Cayman Islands based on internationally accepted principles of data privacy. \n\n**_Privacy Notice_**. The legal basis for this notification is to meet the standards required in respect of, and ensure compliance with, the requirements of DPA which came into effect in the Cayman Islands on 30 September 2019.\n\nThis privacy notice puts investors in the Company on notice that through your investment into the Company you may provide us with certain personal information which constitutes personal data within the meaning of the DPL (“personal data”). The Company collects, uses, discloses, retains and secures personal data to the extent reasonably required only and within the parameters that could be reasonably expected during the normal course of business. The Company will only process, disclose, transfer or retain personal data to the extent legitimately required to conduct the activities of the Company on an ongoing basis or to comply with legal and regulatory obligations to which the Company is subject. The Company will only transfer personal data in accordance with the requirements of the DPA, and will apply appropriate technical and organizational information security measures designed to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing of the personal data and against the accidental loss, destruction or damage to the personal data. In our use of this personal data, we will be characterized as a “data controller” for the purposes of the DPA, while our affiliates and service providers who may receive this personal data from us in the conduct of our activities may either act as our “data processors” for the purposes of the DPA or may process personal information for their own lawful purposes in connection with services provided to the Company.\n\nIf you are a natural person, this will affect you directly. If you are a corporate investor (including, for these purposes, legal arrangements such as trusts or exempted limited partnerships) that provides us with personal data on individuals connected to you for any reason in relation to your investment into the Company, this will be relevant for those individuals and you should inform such individuals of the content.\n\n**_What rights do individuals have in respect of personal data?_**\n\nUnder the DPA, individuals must be informed of the purposes for which their personal data is processed and this privacy notice fulfils the Company’s obligation in this respect. Individuals have rights under the DPA in certain circumstances.\n\nThese may include the right to request access to their personal data, the right to request rectification or correction of personal data, the right to request that processing of personal data be stopped or restricted and the right to require that the Company cease processing personal data for direct marketing purposes.\n\nIf you consider that your personal data has not been handled correctly, or you are not satisfied with the Company’s responses to any requests you have made regarding the use of your personal data, you have the right to complain to the Cayman Islands’ Ombudsman. The Ombudsman can be contacted by calling: +1 (345) 946-6283 or by email at info@ombudsman.ky.\n\n70\n\n**_Contacting the Company_**\n\nFor further information on the collection, use, disclosure, transfer or processing of your personal data or the exercise of any of the rights listed above, please contact us through the address and telephone number of our principal executive office. Our principal website is www.colorstarinternational.com. The information contained in, or accessible through, our website is not incorporated into this prospectus or the registration statement of which it forms a part.\n\n**Economic Substance**\n\nThe Cayman Islands has recently enacted the International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Act (2021 Revision), or the Cayman Economic Substance Act. The Company is required to comply with the Cayman Economic Substance Act. As the Company is a Cayman Islands company, compliance obligations include filing annual notifications for the Company, which need to state whether the Company is carrying out any relevant activities and if so, whether the Company has satisfied economic substance tests to the extent required under the Cayman Economic Substance Act. As it is a new regime, it is anticipated that the Cayman Economic Substance Act will evolve and be subject to further clarification and amendments. The Company may need to allocate additional resources to keep updated with these developments, and may have to make changes to our operations in order to comply with all requirements under the Cayman Economic Substance Act. Failure to satisfy these requirements may subject the Company to penalties under the Cayman Economic Substance Act.\n\n**_The Financial Action Task Force’s Increased Monitoring of the Cayman Islands_**\n\nIn February 2021, the Cayman Islands was added to the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) list of jurisdictions whose anti-money laundering practices are under increased monitoring, commonly referred to as the “FATF grey list.” When the FATF places a jurisdiction under increased monitoring, it means the country has committed to resolve swiftly the identified strategic deficiencies within agreed timeframes and is subject to increased monitoring during that timeframe. It is unclear how long this designation will remain in place and what ramifications, if any, the designation will have for the Company and its group.\n\n**_Certain Anti-Money Laundering Matters_**\n\nIn order to comply with legislation or regulations aimed at the prevention of money laundering, the Company may be required to adopt and maintain anti-money laundering procedures, and may require subscribers to provide evidence to verify their identity. Where permitted, and subject to certain conditions, the Company may also delegate the maintenance of our anti-money laundering procedures (including the acquisition of due diligence information) to a suitable person.\n\nThe Company reserves the right to request such information as is necessary to verify the identity of a subscriber. In the event of delay or failure on the part of the subscriber in producing any information required for verification purposes, we may refuse to accept the application, in which case any funds received will be returned without interest to the account from which they were originally debited.\n\nThe Company also reserves the right to refuse to make any redemption payment to a shareholder if directors or officers suspect or are advised that the payment of redemption proceeds to such shareholder might result in a breach of applicable anti-money laundering or other laws or regulations by any person in any relevant jurisdiction, or if such refusal is considered necessary or appropriate to ensure compliance with any such laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction.\n\nIf any person resident in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects or has reason for knowing or suspecting that another person is engaged in criminal conduct or is involved with terrorism or terrorist property and the information for that knowledge or suspicion came to their attention in the course of their business in the regulated sector, or other trade, profession, business or employment, the person will be required to report such knowledge or suspicion to (i) a nominated officer (appointed in accordance with the Proceeds of Crime Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands) or the Financial Reporting Authority of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act (As Revised), if the disclosure relates to criminal conduct or money laundering or (ii) to a police constable or a nominated officer (pursuant to the Terrorism Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands) or the Financial Reporting Authority, pursuant to the Terrorism Act (As Revised), if the disclosure relates to involvement with terrorism or terrorist financing and terrorist property. Such a report shall not be treated as a breach of confidence or of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed by any enactment or otherwise.\n\n71\n\n**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**\n\nThe Selling Shareholders and any of their respective pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their securities covered hereby on any trading market, stock exchange or other trading facility on which the securities are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. The Selling shareholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling securities:\n\n● | ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  \n---|---  \n● | block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the securities as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  \n● | purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;  \n● | an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;  \n● | privately negotiated transactions;  \n● | settlement of short sales;  \n● | in transactions through broker-dealers that agree with the Selling shareholders to sell a specified number of such securities at a stipulated price per security;  \n● | through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;  \n● | a combination of any such methods of sale; or  \n● | any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.  \n  \nThe Selling shareholders may also sell securities under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus.\n\nBroker-dealers engaged by the Selling shareholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling shareholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of securities, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with FINRA IM-2440.\n\nIn connection with the sale of the securities covered hereby, the Selling shareholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the securities in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The Selling shareholders may also sell securities short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the securities to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The Selling shareholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or create one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of securities offered by this prospectus, which securities such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction).\n\nThe Selling shareholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the securities may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the securities purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. We are requesting that each Selling Stockholder inform us that it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the securities. We will pay certain fees and expenses incurred by us incident to the registration of the securities.\n\n72\n\nBecause the Selling shareholders may be deemed to be an “underwriter” within the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act, including Rule 172 thereunder. In addition, any securities covered by this prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus. We are requesting that each Selling Stockholder confirm that there is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale securities by the Selling Stockholder.\n\nWe intend to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the securities may be resold by the Selling shareholders without registration and without regard to any volume or manner-of-sale limitations by reason of Rule 144, without the requirement for us to be in compliance with the current public information requirement under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the securities have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. The resale securities will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale securities covered hereby may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with.\n\nUnder applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale securities may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the Common Stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the Selling shareholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of the Common Stock by the Selling shareholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the Selling shareholders and are informing the Selling shareholders of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act).\n\n**Regulation M**\n\nThe anti-manipulation rules of Regulation M under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) may apply to sales of our ordinary shares and activities of the selling shareholder.\n\n73\n\n**MATERIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES APPLICABLE TO U.S. HOLDERS OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES**\n\nThe following sets forth the material Cayman Islands, Chinese and U.S. federal income tax consequences related to an investment in our ordinary shares. It is directed to U.S. Holders (as defined below) of our ordinary shares and is based upon laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this prospectus, all of which are subject to change. This description does not deal with all possible tax consequences relating to an investment in our ordinary shares, such as the tax consequences under state, local and other tax laws.\n\nThe following brief description applies only to U.S. Holders (defined below) that hold ordinary shares as capital assets and that have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. This brief description is based on the tax laws of the United States in effect as of the date of this prospectus and on U.S. Treasury regulations in effect or, in some cases, proposed, as of the date of this prospectus, as well as judicial and administrative interpretations thereof available on or before such date. All of the foregoing authorities are subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described below.\n\nThe brief description below of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to “U.S. Holders” will apply to you if you are a beneficial owner of shares and you are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\n\n● | an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;  \n---|---  \n● | a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  \n---|---  \n● | an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or  \n---|---  \n● | a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more U.S. persons for all substantial decisions or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.  \n---|---  \n  \n**WE URGE POTENTIAL PURCHASERS OF OUR SHARES TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PURCHASING, OWNING AND DISPOSING OF OUR SHARES.**\n\n**Generally**\n\nColor Star Technology Co., Ltd. is an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands which is not currently subject to any Cayman Islands taxes. Color China is subject to Hong Kong law. CACM Group NY, Inc. is subject to U.S. laws. \n\n**Cayman Islands Taxation**\n\nThe Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to be material to us levied by the government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be applicable on instruments executed in, or after execution brought within the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is not party to any double tax treaties that are applicable to any payments made to or by our company. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands.\n\nPayments of dividends and capital in respect of the shares will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands and no withholding will be required on the payment of a dividend or capital to any holder of the shares, nor will gains derived from the disposal of the shares be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporation tax.\n\nNo stamp duty is payable in respect of the issue of the shares or on an instrument of transfer in respect of a share.\n\n74\n\n**United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**\n\nThe following discussion is a summary of U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares by a U.S. holder (as defined below) that holds our ordinary shares as “capital assets” (generally, property held for investment) under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). This discussion is based upon existing U.S. federal income tax law, which is subject to differing interpretations and may be changed, possibly with retroactive effect. No ruling has been sought from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any U.S. federal income tax consequences described below, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to particular investors in light of their individual circumstances, including investors subject to special tax rules (for example, banks or other financial institutions, insurance companies, broker-dealers, pension plans, cooperatives, traders in securities that have elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, partnerships and their partners, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, and tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations)), holders who are not U.S. holders, holders who own (directly, indirectly, or constructively) 10% or more of our voting stock, holders who will hold their ordinary shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale, or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or investors that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those summarized below. In addition, this discussion does not discuss any non-United States, alternative minimum tax, state, or local tax considerations, or the Medicare tax on net investment income. Each U.S. holder is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local, and non-United States income and other tax considerations with respect to the ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares.\n\n**_General_**\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created in, or organized under the laws of, the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust (A) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more U.S. persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (B) that has otherwise elected to be treated as a U.S. person under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations.\n\nIf a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding our ordinary shares and partners in such partnerships are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the particular United States federal income tax consequences of an investment in our ordinary shares.\n\n75\n\n**_Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations_**\n\nA non-U.S. corporation, such as our company, will be a “passive foreign investment company,” or “PFIC,” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if, in any particular taxable year, either (i) 75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of “passive” income or (ii) 50% or more of the average quarterly value of its assets (as determined on the basis of fair market value) during such year produce or are held for the production of passive income. For this purpose, cash is categorized as a passive asset and the company’s unbooked intangibles associated with active business activities may generally be classified as active assets. Passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and gains from the disposition of passive assets. We will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which we own, directly or indirectly, at least 25% (by value) of the stock.\n\nAlthough the law in this regard is unclear, we intend to treat CACM as being owned by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and we treat it that way, not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of such entity but also because we are entitled to substantially all of its economic benefits, and, as a result, we consolidate its results of operations in our consolidated financial statements. Assuming that we are the owner of CACM for United States federal income tax purposes, and based upon our income and assets and the value of our ordinary shares, we do not believe that we were a PFIC for the taxable years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and do not anticipate becoming a PFIC in the foreseeable future. \n\nAssuming that we are the owner of CACM for U.S. federal income tax purposes, although we do not believe that we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and do not anticipate becoming a PFIC in the foreseeable future, the determination of whether we are or will become a PFIC will depend in part upon the value of our goodwill and other unrecorded intangibles (which will depend upon the market value of our ordinary shares from time-to-time, which may be volatile). In estimating the value of our goodwill and other unrecorded intangibles, we have taken into account our market capitalization. Among other matters, if our market capitalization is less than anticipated or subsequently declines, we may be or become a PFIC for the current or future taxable years. It is also possible that the IRS may challenge our classification or valuation of our goodwill and other unrecorded intangibles, which may result in our company being or becoming a PFIC for the current or one or more future taxable years. \n\nThe determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC will also depend, in part, on the composition of our income and assets, which may be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets and the cash raised in our initial public offering. If we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes or if we were treated as not owning CACM for United States federal income tax purposes, our risk of being classified as a PFIC may substantially increase. Because our PFIC status for any taxable year is a factual determination that can be made only after the close of a taxable year, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for the current taxable year or any future taxable year. If we are a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. holder held our ordinary shares, we generally would continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. holder held our ordinary shares. \n\nThe discussion below under “Dividends” and “Sale or Other Disposition of ordinary shares” is written on the basis that we will not be or become a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The U.S. federal income tax rules that apply if we are a PFIC for the current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year are generally discussed below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules.”\n\n**_Dividends_**\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below, any cash distributions (including the amount of any tax withheld) paid on our ordinary shares out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, will generally be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder as dividend income on the day actually or constructively received by the U.S. holder. Because we do not intend to determine our earnings and profits on the basis of U.S. federal income tax principles, any distribution paid will generally be reported as a “dividend” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A non-corporate recipient of dividend income will generally be subject to tax on dividend income from a “qualified foreign corporation” at a reduced U.S. federal tax rate rather than the marginal tax rates generally applicable to ordinary income provided that certain holding period requirements are met.\n\n76\n\nA non-U.S. corporation (other than a corporation that is a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year) will generally be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation (a) if it is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the United States which the Secretary of Treasury of the United States determines is satisfactory for purposes of this provision and which includes an exchange of information program, or (b) with respect to any dividend it pays on stock which is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. In the event we are deemed to be a resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be eligible for the benefits of the United States-PRC income tax treaty (which the U.S. Treasury Department has determined is satisfactory for this purpose) and in that case we would be treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends paid on our ordinary shares. Each non-corporate U.S. holder is advised to consult its tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income for any dividends we pay with respect to our ordinary shares. Dividends received on the ordinary shares will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations.\n\nDividends will generally be treated as income from foreign sources for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes and will generally constitute passive category income. In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC “resident enterprise” under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, a U.S. holder may be subject to PRC withholding taxes on dividends paid on our ordinary shares. (See “—People’s Republic of China Taxation”) In that case, a U.S. holder may be eligible, subject to a number of complex limitations, to claim a foreign tax credit in respect of any foreign withholding taxes imposed on dividends received on ordinary shares. A U.S. holder who does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit for foreign tax withheld may instead claim a deduction, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in respect of such withholdings, but only for a year in which such U.S. holder elects to do so for all creditable foreign income taxes. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. U.S. holders are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances.\n\n**_Sale or Other Disposition of Ordinary Shares_**\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the disposition and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such ordinary shares. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term if the ordinary shares have been held for more than one year and will generally be United States source gain or loss for United States foreign tax credit purposes. Long-term capital gain of non-corporate U.S. holders is generally eligible for a reduced rate of taxation. The deductibility of a capital loss may be subject to limitations. In the event that we are treated as a PRC “resident enterprise” under the Enterprise Income Tax Law and gain from the disposition of the ordinary shares is subject to tax in the PRC, a U.S. holder that is eligible for the benefits of the income tax treaty between the United States and the PRC may elect to treat the gain as PRC source income. U.S. holders are advised to consult its tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a foreign tax is imposed on a disposition of our ordinary shares, including the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances and the election to treat any gain as PRC source.\n\n**_Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules_**\n\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder holds our ordinary shares, and unless the U.S. holder makes a mark-to-market election (as described below), the U.S. holder will generally be subject to special tax rules that have a penalizing effect, regardless of whether we remain a PFIC, for subsequent taxable years, on (i) any excess distribution that we make to the U.S. holder (which generally means any distribution paid during a taxable year to a U.S. holder that is greater than 125% of the average annual distributions paid in the three preceding taxable years or, if shorter, the U.S. holder’s holding period for the ordinary shares), and (ii) any gain realized on the sale or other disposition, including, under certain circumstances, a pledge, of ordinary shares. Under the PFIC rules:\n\n● | such excess distribution and/or gain will be allocated ratably over the U.S. holder’s holding period for the ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n● | such amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable years in the U.S. holder’s holding period prior to the first taxable year in which we are a PFIC, or pre-PFIC year, will be taxable as ordinary income;  \n---|---  \n● | such amount allocated to each prior taxable year, other than a pre-PFIC year, will be subject to tax at the highest tax rate in effect for that year; and  \n---|---  \n● | an interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the tax attributable to each prior taxable year, other than a pre-PFIC year.  \n---|---  \n  \n77\n\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder holds our ordinary shares and any of our non-United States subsidiaries is also a PFIC, such U.S. holder would be treated as owning a proportionate amount (by value) of the shares of the lower-tier PFIC for purposes of the application of these rules. U.S. holders are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to any of our subsidiaries.\n\nAs an alternative to the foregoing rules, a U.S. holder of “marketable stock” in a PFIC may make a mark-to-market election. Since we plan to have our ordinary shares listed on the Nasdaq, and provided that the ordinary shares will be regularly traded on the Nasdaq, a U.S. holder holds ordinary shares will be eligible to make a mark-to-market election if we are or were to become a PFIC. If a mark-to-market election is made, the U.S. holder will generally (i) include as ordinary income for each taxable year that we are a PFIC the excess, if any, of the fair market value of ordinary shares held at the end of the taxable year over the adjusted tax basis of such ordinary shares and (ii) deduct as an ordinary loss the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of the ordinary shares over the fair market value of such ordinary shares held at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. The U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the ordinary shares would be adjusted to reflect any income or loss resulting from the mark-to-market election. If a U.S. holder makes an effective mark-to-market election, in each year that we are a PFIC any gain recognized upon the sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares will be treated as ordinary income and loss will be treated as ordinary loss, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. If a U.S. holder makes a mark-to-market election it will be effective for the taxable year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years unless the ordinary shares are no longer regularly traded on a qualified exchange or the Internal Revenue Service consents to the revocation of the election.\n\nIf a U.S. holder makes a mark-to-market election in respect of a PFIC and such corporation ceases to be a PFIC, the U.S. holder will not be required to take into account the mark-to-market gain or loss described above during any period that such corporation is not a PFIC.\n\nBecause a mark-to-market election cannot be made for any lower-tier PFICs that a PFIC may own, a U.S. holder who makes a mark-to-market election with respect to our ordinary shares may continue to be subject to the general PFIC rules with respect to such U.S. holder’s indirect interest in any of our non-United States subsidiaries if any of them is a PFIC.\n\nWe do not intend to provide information necessary for U.S. holders to make qualified electing fund elections, which, if available, would result in tax treatment different from the general tax treatment for PFICs described above.\n\nAs discussed above under “Dividends,” dividends that we pay on our ordinary shares will not be eligible for the reduced tax rate that applies to qualified dividend income if we are a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year. In addition, if a U.S. holder owns our ordinary shares during any taxable year that we are a PFIC, such holder would generally be required to file an annual IRS Form 8621. Each U.S. holder is advised to consult its tax advisors regarding the potential tax consequences to such holder if we are or become a PFIC, including the possibility of making a mark-to-market election.\n\n**_Information Reporting_**\n\nCertain U.S. holders may be required to report information to the IRS relating to an interest in “specified foreign financial assets,” including shares issued by a non-United States corporation, for any year in which the aggregate value of all specified foreign financial assets exceeds US$50,000 (or a higher dollar amount prescribed by the IRS), subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for shares held in custodial accounts maintained with a United States financial institution). These rules also impose penalties if a U.S. holder is required to submit such information to the IRS and fails to do so.\n\nIn addition, U.S. holders may be subject to information reporting to the IRS with respect to dividends on and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares. Each U.S. holder is advised to consult with its tax advisor regarding the application of the United States information reporting rules to their particular circumstances.\n\n78\n\n**LEGAL MATTERS**\n\nThe legality and validity of the securities offered from time to time under this prospectus was passed upon Conyers Dill & Pearman to the extent governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands, who are acting as counsel to our company with respect to matters of Cayman Islands law. Ortoli Rosenstadt LLP is acting as counsel to our company regarding U.S. securities law matters. \n\nThe current address of Conyers Dill & Pearman is Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, PO Box 2681, Grand Cayman KY1-1111, Cayman Islands. The current address of Ortoli Rosenstadt LLP is 366 Madison Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York, NY 10017.\n\n79\n\n**EXPERTS**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 2019 and 2018 as set forth in this prospectus and elsewhere in the registration statement have been so included in reliance on the report of Wei, Wei & Co., LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm given on their authority as experts in accounting and auditing. The current address of Wei, Wei & Co., LLP is 133-10 39th Avenue, Flushing, NY 11354. \n\n80\n\n**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**\n\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability. We incorporated in the Cayman Islands because of certain benefits associated with being a Cayman Islands exempted company, such as political and economic stability, an effective judicial system, a favorable tax system, the absence of foreign exchange control or currency restrictions and the availability of professional and support services. However, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of securities laws that provide significantly less protection to investors as compared to the securities laws of the United States. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the United States.\n\nAll of our assets are located in China. In addition, some of our directors and officers are residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our directors and officers, or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\n\nAccording to Conyers Dill & Pearman, our local Cayman Islands’ counsel, there is uncertainty with regard to Cayman Islands law relating to whether a judgment obtained from the United States or Hong Kong courts under civil liability provisions of the securities laws will be determined by the courts of the Cayman Islands as penal or punitive in nature. If such a determination is made, the courts of the Cayman Islands will not recognize or enforce the judgment against a Cayman Islands’ company. The courts of the Cayman Islands in the past determined that disgorgement proceedings brought at the instance of the Securities and Exchange Commission are penal or punitive in nature and such judgments would not be enforceable in the Cayman Islands. Other civil liability provisions of the securities laws may be characterized as remedial, and therefore enforceable but the Cayman Islands’ Courts have not yet ruled in this regard. Our Cayman Islands’ counsel has further advised us that a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of the United States under which a sum of money is payable other than a sum payable in respect of taxes, fines, penalties or similar charges, may be subject to enforcement proceedings as a debt in the courts of the Cayman Islands.\n\nAs of the date hereof, no treaty or other form of reciprocity exists between the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong governing the recognition and enforcement of judgments.\n\nCayman Islands’ counsel further advised that although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States or Hong Kong, a judgment obtained in such jurisdictions will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment (1) is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction, (2) imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given, (3) is final, (4) is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty, and (5) was not obtained in a manner and is of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands.\n\n81\n\n**WHERE YOU CAN FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**\n\nWe are subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act, applicable to foreign private issuers. As a “foreign private issuer”, we are exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act prescribing certain disclosure and procedural requirements for proxy solicitations, and our officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and “short-swing” profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act, with respect to their purchases and sales of shares. In addition, we are not required to file annual, quarterly and current reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as United States companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. However, we anticipate filing with the SEC, within four months after the end of each fiscal year, an annual report on Form 20-F containing financial statements audited by an independent registered public accounting firm. We also anticipate furnishing semi-annual reports on Form 6-K containing unaudited interim financial information for the first two quarters of each fiscal year, within 6 months after the end of such quarter.\n\nThis prospectus does not contain all of the information set forth in the registration statement and the exhibits to the registration statement. For further information with respect to us and the securities the Selling shareholders are offering under this prospectus, we refer you to the registration statement and the exhibits and schedules filed as a part of the registration statement. You may read and copy the registration statement, as well as our reports, proxy statements and other information, at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You can request copies of these documents by writing to the SEC and paying a fee for the copying cost. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for more information about the operation of the Public Reference Room. The reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, are also available on the SEC’s web site at http://www.sec.gov. \n\n82\n\n**DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES**\n\nOur Articles of Association require us to indemnify any of our officers or directors, and certain other persons, under certain circumstances, against all expenses and liabilities incurred or suffered by such persons because of a lawsuit or similar proceeding to which the person is made a party by reason of his being a director or officer of our company or another body corporate, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise at our company’s request, unless this is prohibited by law. We may also purchase and maintain insurance for the benefit of any director or officer which may cover claims for which we could not indemnify a director or officer. We have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification of our officers, directors and controlling persons under these provisions, or otherwise, is against public policy and is unenforceable.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is therefore unenforceable.\n\n83\n\n**INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**Consolidated Financial Statements for the Six Months Ended December 31, 2020** **and 2019**  \n---  \n[Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020 (Unaudited)](#fin_007) |  F-2  \n[Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the Six Months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (Unaudited)](#fin_008) |  F-3  \n[Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity for the Six Months ended December 31, 2020 (Unaudited)](#fin_009) |  F-4  \n[Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Six Months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (Unaudited)](#fin_010) |  F-5  \n[Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements](#fin_011) |  F-6  \n  \nF-1\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.

(the “Company” or “Color Star”) is an entertainment and education company which provides online entertainment performances and online music education services via its wholly-owned subsidiary, Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”). \n\nThe Company was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C-corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, TJS Wood Flooring, Inc. changed its name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. (“CADC Delaware”). On August 1, 2013, CADC Delaware consummated a reincorporation merger with its newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. (“CADC Nevada”), a Nevada corporation, with CADC Delaware merging into CADC Nevada and CADC Nevada being the surviving company, for the purpose of changing CADC Delaware’s state of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada. On December 27, 2018, CADC Nevada was merged with and into China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. (“CADC Cayman”), a Cayman Islands corporation, whereupon the separate existence of CADC Nevada ceased and CADC Cayman continued as the surviving entity. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company is governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands. \n\nOn July 16, 2019, CADC Cayman changed its name from “China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc.” to “Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.” On April 27, 2020, Huitao Technology Co., Ltd. changed its name to “Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.” \n\n_CACM Group NY, Inc._\n\nOn August 20, 2018, CACM Group NY, Inc. (“CACM”) was incorporated in the State of New York and is 100% owned by the Company. As of the date of this report, CACM has not commenced any business operations and the Company is currently using CACM as its headquarters in the United States of America. \n\n_Baytao LLC (“Baytao”)_\n\nOn March 10, 2020, CACM entered into a joint venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Baydolphin, Inc. (“Baydolphin”), a company organized under the laws of New York. Pursuant to the JV Agreement, \n\n● |  CACM and Baydolphin established a limited liability company under the laws of New York, Baytao, which will be the 100% owner of one or more operating entities in the U.S. to engage in the business of online and offline after-school education.  \n---|---  \n● |  The business of Baytao shall be managed by the Board of Managers of Baytao.  \n---|---  \n● |  CACM shall appoint three designees to the Board of Managers of Baytao and Baydolphin shall appoint two designees. The General Manager of Baytao shall be appointed by CACM and report to the Board of Managers.  \n---|---  \n● |  CACM shall contribute necessary capital for the operating entities to fund their operations and obtain the right to use the software platform and other technologies from Color Star, which will be provided to the JV and its operating entities for no charge to facilitate their operations and provide online classes to their registered students, and Baydolphin shall be responsible for managing these entities with its expertise in after-school education, including but not limited to recruiting and training personnel and implementing all promotional and marketing activities.  \n---|---  \n● |  Eighty percent (80%) of the net profits or net loss of the joint venture will be distributed to or assigned to CACM and the remaining twenty percent (20%) to Baydolphin.  \n---|---  \n  \nAs of the date of this report, Baytao has no business operations as it is still in the process of developing its online and offline after-school education business. \n\nF-6\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n_Color China_\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and caused massive global health and economic crisis, while also causing large-scale social and behavioral changes in societies. Online entertainment and online education are experiencing enormous growth which the Company believes will last long after the pandemic. In order to expand the Company’s global reach and to enter into an online business, on May 7, 2020, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with Color China, a Hong Kong limited company, and shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company acquired all of the outstanding issued shares in Color China from the sellers (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Color China, the Company agreed to issue 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company and pay an aggregate of $2,000,000 to the Sellers. On June 3, 2020, the Acquisition was consummated and the Company issued 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company to the Sellers and closed on the same date. Since Color China had no business operations other than holding a significant collection of music performance specific equipment, the transaction has been treated as an acquisition of assets, as it did not meet the definition of a business. The Company plans to make Color China an emerging online performance and online music education provider with a significant collection of performance specific assets -- leveraging professional experience of the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) who has established good relationships with major record companies, renowned artists and entertainment agencies around the world. Color China is in the process of building an online entertainment and music education platform featuring artists and professional producers as its lead instructors. Color China officially launched its online cultural entertainment platform, Color World, globally on September 10, 2020. \n\n_BVI-ACM_\n\nPrior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, the Company’s core business had been the concrete business in China. The Company had a wholly-owned subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands, Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (“BVI-ACM”), which was a holding company with no operations. BVI-ACM had a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary, Beijing Ao Hang Construction Material Technology Co., Ltd. (“China-ACMH”), and China-ACMH had contractual agreements with Beijing XinAo Concrete Group (“Xin Ao”) and therefore Xin Ao was considered a variable interest entity of China-ACMH. The Company, through BVI-ACM and its variable interest entities (“VIEs”), was engaged in producing general ready-mix concrete, customized mechanical refining concrete, and other concrete-related products that are only sold in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”). The Company’s concrete business was negatively affected by the economic cycle and government policies. The concrete industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The entire concrete industry in the PRC’s Beijing area experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years as the Beijing government continues to enforce concrete production reformation and tightened environmental laws from late 2017 to date. The reformation causes great uncertainties for local enterprises in the construction market. Since 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down. Also, the Beijing government ordered the suspension of construction job sites during winters to reduce air pollution since 2017. The operations of Xin Ao were also severely affected. As a result of Xin Ao’s deteriorating cash position, it defaulted on bank loans and experienced a substantial increase in contingent liabilities. The Company believed it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to turn around the concrete business. As such, the Company had been actively seeking to dispose of the concrete business after the acquisition of Sunway Kids. \n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company, BVI-ACM, and Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He (the “XA Purchasers”) who collectively held less than 5% ordinary shares of the Company currently), entered into a share purchase agreement (the “XA Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the XA Disposition SPA, the XA Purchasers agreed to purchase BVI-ACM for cash consideration of $600,000. Upon the closing of the transaction (the “XA Disposition”) contemplated by the XA Disposition SPA, the XA Purchasers will become the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and assume all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and VIE entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The closing of the XA Disposition was subject to certain closing conditions including the payment of the $600,000, the receipt of a fairness opinion from ViewTrade Securities Inc. and the approval of the Company’s shareholders. On May 6, 2020, the Company completed the disposition of BVI-ACM after obtaining its shareholders’ approval on April 27, 2020 and satisfaction or waiver of all other closing conditions. Upon the closing of the XA Disposition, the XA Purchases became the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The assets and liabilities and the results of operations of BVI-ACM had been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. \n\nF-7\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n**Note 2 – Summary of significant accounting policies**\n\n_Liquidity_\n\nIn assessing the Company’s liquidity, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash on-hand and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Company’s liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s working capital was approximately $3.9 million with cash on-hand of approximately $0.4 million. \n\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company completed a series of equity financing transactions follows: \n\n● |  On February 18, 2021, the Company sold an aggregate of 20,000,000 units, each unit consisting of one restrictive ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.001 per share and a warrant to purchase one share with an initial exercise price of $1.34 per share, at a price of $1.30 per unit, for gross proceeds of $26,000,000.  \n---|---  \n● |  From January to March 2021, the Company’s Warrant holders converted a total of 8,330,000 warrants into a total of 8,330,000 ordinary shares at a weighted exercise price of $0.55 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $4.6 million.  \n---|---  \n  \nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company has entered into a number of contractual and business arrangements as follows: \n\n● |  On February 1, 2021, the Company entered into certain copyright purchase agreement (the “Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire certain copyrights listed in the Agreement for a consideration of $3,100,000. The Company agreed to pay $1,550,000 cash payment to the transferor, and issue the Company’s restrictive ordinary shares, at $0.85 per share for a total of 1,814,818 shares to the transferor. As date of this report, the Company made cash payments of $1,550,000 to the third party.  \n---|---  \n● |  On February 15, 2021, the Company entered into certain software development agreement (the “Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to hire certain third party to develop augmented reality functions of the Color World APP for a total consideration of $76,500,000. The development should be completed in 16 months, and the Company agreed to pay $26,000,000 cash payment to the third party after signing the Agreement, to pay $30,000,000 after both parties agree on the design blueprints, to pay $20,000,000 after the third party completes the design and testing, and to pay the remaining $500,000 after the Company receives all the source codes. As date of this report, the Company made cash payments of $26,000,000 to the third party.  \n---|---  \n  \nAs a result of the aforementioned transactions, the Company’s management is of the opinion that it has sufficient funds to meet the Company’s working capital requirements and contractual commitments and related obligations as they become due starting from one year from the date of this report. \n\n_Basis of presentation_\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all the directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and VIEs listed below. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Interim results are not necessary indicative of results of a full year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary to give a fair presentation have been included. The information in this Form 6-K should be read in conjunction with information in the annual report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on November 13, 2020. \n\nF-8\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n_Principles of consolidation_\n\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the activities of the following subsidiaries and VIEs. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. \n\nSubsidiaries and VIEs  |  Place incorporated  |  Ownership percentage   \n---|---|---  \nCACM  |  New York, USA  |  100 |  %   \nBaytao  |  New York, USA  |  80 |  %   \nColor China  |  Hong Kong  |  100 |  %   \nBVI-ACM(1) |  British Virgin Island  |  100 |  %   \nChina-ACMH(1) |  Beijing, China  |  100 |  %   \nXin Ao(1) |  Beijing, China  |  VIE  \n(1) |  The Company sold BVI-ACM and its subsidiaries to two former officers (CEO and CFO) who collectively held less than 5% ordinary shares of the Company currently for $600,000 in May 2020. See Note 4 – Discontinued operations for details.  \n---|---  \n  \n_Use of estimates and assumptions_\n\nThe preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The significant estimates and assumptions made in the preparation of the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts of accounts receivable, other receivables, prepayments and advances, stock-based compensation, and fair value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Actual results could be materially different from those estimates. \n\n_Foreign currency translation_\n\nThe reporting currency of the Company, CACM, Baytao, and Color China is the U.S. dollar (“US$”). The functional currency of BVI-ACM is the U.S. dollar. China-ACMH and Xin Ao use their local currency, the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”) as their functional currency. In accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance on Foreign Currency Translation, the Company’s results of discontinued operations and cash flows are translated at the average exchange rates during the period, assets and liabilities of discontinued operations are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date, and equity is translated at historical exchange rates. \n\nThe average translation rate applied to the consolidated statements of discontinued operations and comprehensive loss and cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 2019 was RMB 7.03 to US$1.00. \n\nTranslation gains (losses) that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations. There were no foreign currency transaction gains or losses for the six months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). \n\n_Discontinued operations_\n\nIn accordance with ASU No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results when the components of an entity meet the criteria in paragraph 205-20-45-1E to be classified as discontinued operations. When all of the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations are met, including management having the authority to approve the action and committing to a plan to sell the entity or the components, the major current assets, other assets, current liabilities, and noncurrent liabilities shall be reported as components of total assets and liabilities separate from the balances of the continuing operations. At the same time, the results of discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes (benefit), shall be reported as components of net income (loss) separate from the net income (loss) of continuing operations in accordance with ASC 205-20-45. See Note 4 – Discontinued operations. \n\nF-9\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n_Revenue recognition_\n\nThe Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). The core principle underlying this ASU is that the Company recognizes its revenue to represent the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in such exchange. This requires the Company to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time, based on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer. The Company’s revenue streams are primarily recognized at a point in time, principally upon music performance performed or education services provided. \n\nThe ASU requires the use of a five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that the Company (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation. The application of the five-step model to the revenue streams compared to the prior guidance did not result in significant changes in the way the Company records its revenue. \n\nThe Company accounts for a contract with a customer when the contract is committed in writing, the rights of the parties, including payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration to collect is substantially probable. \n\nWith the acquisition of Color China, the Company offers the following services: \n\n(a) |  Online education academy  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company earns revenues from its customers for subscription and tuition fees in connection with online courses to be instructed by individuals with extensive experience in the entertainment and/or music industries. The Company offers membership services to subscribing members with various privileges, which primarily include access to free courses, exclusive VIP courses, on-demand contents (such as online concerts), and others. \n\nWhen the receipt of membership fees is for services to be delivered over a period of time, the receipt is initially recorded as “customer deposit or deferred revenue” on the consolidated balance sheets and revenue is recognized ratably over the membership period as services are rendered, usually one year. Membership services revenue also includes fees earned from subscribing members for on-demand content purchases and early access to premium content. The Company is principal in its relationships where its partners, including artist agents, mobile operators, internet service providers and online payment agencies, provide access to the membership services or payment processing services as we retain control over its service delivery to our subscribing members. Typically, payments made to its partners, are recorded as cost of revenues and as research and development expenses prior to any revenues being generated in this revenue stream. During the six months ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not make any online education academy sales as the online education academy App only operated for a short period of time and the Company used free access to all courses to attract more users. \n\n(b) |  Online concert  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company holds online concerts with its star partners. Sale of online concert via subscription fee is accounted for as a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time on the day of the event. Online concert subscription fees are recognized net of App payment collections agent service fee. All ticket sales are final upon payment. \n\n(c) |  Online store  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company holds an online marketplace for merchants to sell celebrity licensed or cobranded merchandise such as fashions, cosmetics, souvenirs, among others. The Company charges commission fees to e-commerce merchants for selling in the Company’s online marketplace platform when the sales transaction is completed. The Company serves as an agent and its performance obligation is to arrange for the provision of the specified goods by those e-commerce merchants, and is not responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, and it does not have the ability to control the related shipping services. Upon completion of the sales transaction, the Company will charge the e-commerce merchants a fixed rate commission fee based on the sales amount. Commission fee revenues are recognized on a net basis at the point of delivery of products, net of a return allowance, if applicable. The Company’s online App store has been put online since December 2020 but did not generate any revenues during the six months ended December 31, 2020. \n\nF-10\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nAs a practical expedient, the Company elects to record the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. \n\n_Financial instruments_\n\nUS GAAP specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques for determining the fair value of financial instruments and related fair value measurements based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs). The valuation hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. In accordance with FASB ASC 820, the following summarizes the fair value hierarchy: \n\nThe three levels of inputs are defined as follows: \n\nLevel 1 |  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;  \n---|---  \nLevel 2 |  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument;  \n---|---  \nLevel 3 |  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable.  \n---|---  \n  \nFinancial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at face value or cost, which approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rates of interest. \n\n_Cash and cash equivalents_\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. \n\n_Accounts receivable_\n\nAccounts receivable primarily include online concert subscription fees due from App payment collections agent. Management regularly reviews the age of these receivables and changes in payment trends and will record an allowance for uncollectible when management believes collection of amounts due is at risk. Accounts considered uncollectible are written off against the allowance after exhaustive efforts at collection are made. \n\n_Other receivables_\n\nOther receivables primarily include security deposit and receivable from the disposal of its discontinued operation. Management regularly reviews the age of these receivables and changes in payment trends and will record an allowance for uncollectible when management believes collection of amounts due is at risk. Accounts considered uncollectible are written off against the allowance after exhaustive efforts at collection are made. \n\nF-11\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n_Prepayments and advances_\n\nPrepayments include funds deposited or advanced to outside vendors for future performance obligations, program license fees and service fees. As a standard practice in the music performance industry, many of the Company’s vendors require a certain amount to be deposited with them as a guarantee that the Company will complete its purchases on a timely basis. The Company has legally binding contracts with its vendors, the prepayments will be used to offset performance fees, program license fees, purchase price or service fees, and the amounts are refundable and bear no interest if outside vendors breach the contracts. \n\n_Property, plant and equipment_\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost or at fair value of the identifiable assets acquired on the acquisition date less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of each class of depreciable assets and is computed using the straight-line method with 0%-5% residual value. \n\nThe estimated useful lives of assets are as follows: \n\nUseful life  \n---  \nPerformance equipment |  10 years  \nOffice equipment |  5 years  \n  \n_Intangible assets, net_\n\nIntangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization expense is recognized on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company has obtained copyrights to use the online education academy courses for 3 years to unlimited years. The Company amortizes the copyrights with limited useful life over their useful life using the straight-line method and amortizes the copyrights with unlimited useful life over 5 years, which the copyrights is expected to contribute to the revenue of the Company’s online education academy App. \n\n_Accounting for long-lived assets_\n\nThe Company classifies its long-lived assets into: (i) performance equipment; (ii) office equipment and (iii) intangible assets. \n\nLong-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technological or other industry changes. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. \n\nIf the value of an asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less disposition costs. \n\nThere were no impairment charges for the six months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. \n\nCompetitive pricing pressures and changes in interest rates could materially and adversely affect the Company’s estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by the long-lived assets, and thus could result in future impairment losses. \n\nF-12\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n_Leases_\n\nEffective July 1, 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842), and elected the practical expedients that does not require us to reassess: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are, or contain, leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (3) initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases. For lease terms of twelve months or fewer, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and liabilities. The Company also adopted the practical expedient that allows lessees to treat the lease and non-lease components of a lease as a single lease component. \n\nOperating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the adoption date of July 1, 2019 or the commencement date, whichever is earlier, based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since the implicit rate for the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company use its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments, in a similar economic environment and over a similar term. \n\nLease terms used to calculate the present value of lease payments generally do not include any options to extend, renew, or terminate the lease, as the Company does not have reasonable certainty at lease inception that these options will be exercised. The Company generally considers the economic life of its operating lease ROU assets to be comparable to the useful life of similar owned assets. The Company has elected the short-term lease exception, therefore operating lease ROU assets and liabilities do not include leases with a lease term of twelve months or less. Its leases generally do not provide a residual guarantee. The operating lease ROU asset also excludes lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet as operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities. \n\nThe Company reviews the impairment of its ROU assets consistent with the approach applied for its other long-lived assets. The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on its ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows of the related operations. The Company has elected to include the carrying amount of operating lease liabilities in any tested asset group and include the associated operating lease payments in the undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows. \n\n_Stock-based compensation_\n\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for employees at fair value on the grant date and recognizes the expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The Company’s expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The expected life assumption is primarily based on historical exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of an option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s current and expected dividend policy. \n\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for non-employees at fair value on the grant date and recognizes the expense over the service provider’s requisite service period. \n\n_Income taxes_\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires the Company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Under this accounting standard, the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, a deferred tax asset will not be realized. \n\nASC 740-10, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” defines uncertainty in income taxes and the evaluation of a tax position as a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of that position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met. Penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the period incurred. United States federal, state and local income tax returns for year 2019 and 2020 are subject to examination by any applicable tax authorities. Hong Kong tax returns filed for calendar year 2020 are subject to examination by the applicable tax authorities. \n\nF-13\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\n_Earnings (loss) per share_\n\nThe Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires presentation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share in conjunction with the disclosure of the methodology used in computing such earnings per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts, such as warrants, options, restricted stock based grants and convertible preferred stock, to issue ordinary shares were exercised and converted into ordinary shares. Ordinary share equivalents having an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. \n\nDilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase ordinary shares at the average market price during the period. When the Company has a loss, no potential dilutive items are included since they would be antidilutive. \n\nStock dividends or stock splits are accounted for retroactively if the stock dividends or stock splits occur during the period, or retroactively if the stock dividends or stock splits occur after the end of the period but before the release of the financial statements, by considering it effective as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. \n\n_Comprehensive income (loss)_\n\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and foreign currency translation adjustments. \n\n_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement” (“ASU 2018-13”). ASU 2018-13 removes, modifies and adds certain disclosure requirements in Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurement”. ASU 2018-13 eliminates certain disclosures related to transfers and the valuations process, modifies disclosures for investments that are valued based on net asset value, clarifies the measurement uncertainty disclosure, and requires additional disclosures for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, which is an update to ASU Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduced the expected credit losses methodology for the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis, replacing the previous incurred loss methodology. The amendments in Update 2016-13 added Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses, and made several consequential amendments to the Codification. Update 2016-13 also modified the accounting for available-for-sale debt securities, which must be individually assessed for credit losses when fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, in accordance with Subtopic 326-30, Financial Instruments— Credit Losses—Available-for-Sale Debt Securities. The amendments in this Update address those stakeholders’ concerns by providing an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option for certain financial assets previously measured at amortized cost basis. For those entities, the targeted transition relief will increase comparability of financial statement information by providing an option to align measurement methodologies for similar financial assets. Furthermore, the targeted transition relief also may reduce the costs for some entities to comply with the amendments in Update 2016-13 while still providing financial statement users with decision-useful information. ASU 2019-05 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2023 as the Company is qualified as a smaller reporting company. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2019-05 may have on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. \n\nF-14\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n\nNOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01 to clarify the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under ASC 321 and investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting in ASC 323 and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under ASC 815. With respect to the interactions between ASC 321 and ASC 323, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting when applying the measurement alternative in ASC 321, immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method of accounting. With respect to forward contracts or purchased options to purchase securities, the amendments clarify that when applying the guidance in ASC 815-10-15-141(a), an entity should not consider whether upon the settlement of the forward contract or exercise of the purchased option, individually or with existing investments, the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method in ASC 323 or the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825. The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. \n\nThe Company does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. \n\n__Reclassifications__\n\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period of discontinued operations presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. \n\n**Note 3 – Business Combinations**\n\n_Acquisition of Color China_\n\nOn May 7, 2020, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with Color China, a Hong Kong limited company, and shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the outstanding issued shares of Color China from the sellers (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company will issue 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company and pay an aggregate of $2.0 million to the Sellers. Immediately after the Acquisition, Color Star will own 100% of Color China. On June 3, 2020, the transaction was closed and the Company issued 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company to the Sellers. Color China had no business operations other than holding a collection of music performance equipment. \n\nThe Company’s acquisition of Color China was accounted for as an acquisition of assets in accordance with ASC 805. The measurement is based on the fair value of the consideration given to acquire the assets (primarily performance and office equipment) held in Color China as it is more clearly evident and more reliably measurable. The total consideration given to acquire assets held in Color China at the acquisition date on June 3, 2020 were valued at approximately $4.0 million, consisted of 4,633,333 ordinary shares issued at a fair value of $1,963,607 based on the closing market price of $0.4238 per share on June 3, 2020, and cash payment of $2.0 million. \n\n**Note 4 – Discontinued Operations**\n\n_Disposal of BVI-ACM_\n\nThe Company’s concrete business was negatively affected by the economic cycle and government policies. The concrete industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The entire concrete industry in the Beijing area experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years as the Beijing government continues to enforce concrete production reformation and tightened environmental laws from late 2017 to date. The reformation causes great uncertainties for local enterprises in the construction market. Since 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down. Also, the Beijing government ordered the suspension of construction job sites during winters to reduce air pollution since 2017. The operations of Xin Ao were also severely affected. As a result of Xin Ao’s deteriorating cash position, it defaulted on bank loans and experienced a substantial increase in contingent liabilities. The Company believed it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to turn around the concrete business. Accordingly, the Company’s management decided to dispose of this business by actively seeking a purchaser after the acquisition of Sunway Kids. \n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company, BVI-ACM, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He (the “Purchasers”), two former officers (CEO and CFO) and collectively held less than 5% ordinary shares of the Company currently, entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the Purchasers agreed to purchase BVI-ACM in exchange for cash consideration of $600,000. Upon the closing of the transaction (the “Disposition”) the Purchasers assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and VIE entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The closing of the Disposition was completed on May 6, 2020. After disposal of BVI-ACM, the Company had no continuing involvement or commitments with BVI-ACM. \n\nF-15\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.

US GAAP requires that the Company’s leases be evaluated and classified as operating or finance leases for financial reporting purposes. The classification evaluation begins at the commencement date and the lease term used in the evaluation includes the non-cancellable period for which the Company has the right to use the underlying asset, together with renewal option periods when the exercise of the renewal option is reasonably certain and failure to exercise such option which result in an economic penalty. All of the Company’s real estate leases are classified as operating leases. \n\nThe Company has a lease agreement for office space in New York from June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2021, with annual payments of $46,896. The Company did not recognize the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet as this lease has an initial term of 12 months or less.

The net operating loss carry forwards in the U.S. are available to reduce future years’ taxable income for unlimited years but limited to 80% use per year. In addition, Color China’s net operating loss carry forward for Hong Kong income taxes was approximately $0.9 million as of December 31, 2020. The net operating loss carry forwards in Hong Kong are available to reduce future years’ taxable income for unlimited years. Management believes that the realization of the benefits from these losses appears uncertain due to the Company’s operating history and continued losses in the U.S. and Hong Kong. If the Company is unable to generate taxable income in its United States and Hong Kong operations, it is more likely than not that it will not have sufficient income to utilize its deferred tax assets. Accordingly, the Company has provided a 100% valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets of approximately $393,000 and $134,000 to its U.S. and Hong Kong operations as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively. The value allowance for deferred tax assets increased by approximately $259,000 from June 30, 2020 to December 31, 2020. \n\n**(b)** |  **Uncertain tax positions**  \n---|---  \n  \nThere were no uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, management does not anticipate any potential future adjustments which would result in a material change to its tax positions.

(formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.) and Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  **Basis for Opinion** These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  /s/ Wei, Wei & Co.

Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Color China, the Company agreed to issue 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company and pay an aggregate of $2,000,000 to the Sellers. On June 3, 2020, the Acquisition was consummated and the Company issued 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company to the Sellers and closed on the same date. Since Color China had no business operations other than holding a significant collection of music performance specific equipment, the transaction has been treated as an acquisition of assets, as it did not meet the definition of a business. The Company plans to make Color China an emerging online performance and online music education provider with a significant collection of performance specific assets -- leveraging professional experience of the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) who has established good relationships with major record companies, renowned artists and entertainment agencies around the world. Color China is in the process of building an online entertainment and music education platform featuring artists and professional producers as its lead instructors. Color China officially launched its online cultural entertainment platform, Color World, globally on September 10, 2020.\n\n_Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”)_\n\nSunway Kids is an education and health service provider to day-care and preschools in China. Sunway Kids has a highly skilled professional team experienced in early childhood development. It provides a well-structured system for early childhood education, including artificial intelligence and robotic technologies, intellectual campus administration software as a service system (“SAAS system”) and online education courses for kids and parents. With the introduction of the national two-child policy in China since 2015, birth rate in China has been increasing and thus provides an increase in service opportunities for the preschool education industry. With the deepening of China’s economic reforms, the disposable income of urban residents has continued to increase. With the improvement of living standards of urban residents, families are more willing to invest in education, training, and other services for their children starting at a young age.\n\nIn order to expand the Company’s revenue capacity, on December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Share Exchange Agreement”) with Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”), a British Virgin Islands company, and the shareholders of Sunway Kids (the “Sellers of SK”), pursuant to which the Company will acquire all of the outstanding issued shares of Sunway Kids (the “SK Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Sunway Kids, the Company will issue 1,989,262 ordinary shares of the Company and pay two million U.S. dollars. On February 11, 2020, the Company, Sunway Kids and the Sellers of SK entered into an Amendment No. 1 (“Amendment 1”) to the Share Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to Amendment 1, the cash consideration will be payable to the Sellers of SK according to an earn-out schedule. On February 14, 2020, the SK Acquisition was closed and the Company issued 1,989,262 ordinary shares to the Sellers of SK. The shares had a fair value of approximately $1.9 million based on the closing market price of $0.95 per share on February, 14, 2020, the acquisition date. The total consideration was valued at approximately $3.6 million, which include approximately $1.7 million based upon a 5.8% discount rate of the $2.0 million earn-out payment schedule, and approximately $1.9 million for the shares issued.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the Company and the former shareholders of Sunway Kids entered into an Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment 2”) to the Share Exchange Agreement dated December 31, 2019. Pursuant to Amendment 2, the Company shall not make any the earn-out payment to the former shareholders of Sunway Kids since Sunway Kids has been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and management of Sunway Kids believes it will be very difficult to achieve its projected financial results. On the same day, Sunway Kids and Yanliang Han (the “SK Purchaser”), an unrelated third party, entered into certain share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the SK Purchaser agreed to purchase Sunway Kids for cash consideration of $2.4 million consisting of $400,000 which shall be paid within a month of closing, and $2,000,000 to be paid in monthly installments of $200,000 over 10 months. On June 25, 2020, the transaction closed and as a result, the SK Purchaser acquired Sunway Kids and all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled them. Sunway Kids had no operations from February 14, 2020 to June 25, 2020 as management had been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The SK Purchaser subsequently settled $1.0 million of the total $2.4 million payment obligation. Although the SK Purchaser is current with its installment payment, the Company will recognize the installment payment on a cash basis as collectability of the remaining $1.4 million cannot be reasonably assured. The disposition of Sunway Kids resulted in the recognition of a loss of approximately $0.8 million that is recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the caption of “loss from discontinued operations.” The disposition of Sunway Kids was classified as a discontinued operation because it represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company’s operation on artificial intelligence education for preschool kids and financial results in accordance with ASC 205-20-45.\n\nF-33\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n_BVI-ACM_\n\nPrior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, the Company’s core business had been the concrete business in China. The Company had a wholly-owned subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands, Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (“BVI-ACM”), which was a holding company with no operations. BVI-ACM had a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary, Beijing Ao Hang Construction Material Technology Co., Ltd. (“China-ACMH”), and China-ACMH had contractual agreements with Beijing XinAo Concrete Group (“Xin Ao”) and therefore Xin Ao was considered a variable interest entity of China-ACMH. The Company, through BVI-ACM and its variable interest entities (“VIEs”), was engaged in producing general ready-mix concrete, customized mechanical refining concrete, and other concrete-related products that are only sold in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”). The Company’s concrete business was negatively affected by the economic cycle and government policies. The concrete industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The entire concrete industry in the PRC’s Beijing area experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years as the Beijing government continues to enforce concrete production reformation and tightened environmental laws from late 2017 to date. The reformation causes great uncertainties for local enterprises in the construction market. Since 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down. Also, the Beijing government ordered the suspension of construction job sites during winters to reduce air pollution since 2017. The operations of Xin Ao were also severely affected. As a result of Xin Ao’s deteriorating cash position, it defaulted on bank loans and experienced a substantial increase in contingent liabilities. The Company believed it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to turn around the concrete business. As such, the Company had been actively seeking to dispose of the concrete business after the acquisition of Sunway Kids.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company, BVI-ACM, and Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He (the “XA Purchasers”) who collectively held less than 5% ordinary shares of the Company currently), entered into a share purchase agreement (the “XA Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the XA Disposition SPA, the XA Purchasers agreed to purchase BVI-ACM for cash consideration of $600,000. Upon the closing of the transaction (the “XA Disposition”) contemplated by the XA Disposition SPA, the XA Purchasers will become the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and assume all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and VIE entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The closing of the XA Disposition was subject to certain closing conditions including the payment of the $600,000, the receipt of a fairness opinion from ViewTrade Securities Inc. and the approval of the Company’s shareholders. On May 6, 2020, the Company completed the disposition of BVI-ACM after obtaining its shareholders’ approval on April 27, 2020 and satisfaction or waiver of all other closing conditions. Upon the closing of the XA Disposition, the XA Purchases became the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The assets and liabilities and the results of operations of BVI-ACM had been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The disposal of BVI-ACM resulted in a gain of approximately $6.6 million that is recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) under the caption of “loss from discontinued operations”.\n\n**Note 2 – Summary of significant accounting policies**\n\n_Liquidity_\n\nIn assessing the Company’s liquidity, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash on-hand and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Company’s liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. As of June 30, 2020, the Company’s working capital was approximately $2.6 million with cash on-hand of approximately $1.0 million.\n\nSubsequent to June 30, 2020, the Company completed a series of equity financing transactions follows: \n\n● |  On July 20, 2020, the Company sold 3,225,000 ordinary shares at the offering price of $1.30 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $4.2 million.  \n---|---  \n● |  In August and September 2020, the Company’s Warrant holders converted a total of 5,227,274 warrants into a total of 5,227,274 ordinary shares at a weighted exercise price of $0.11 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $0.6 million.  \n---|---  \n● |  On September 8, 2020, the Company sold 793,651 ordinary shares at the offering price of $0.63 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $0.5 million.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nSubsequent to June 30, 2020, the Company has entered into a number of contractual and business arrangements as follows:: \n\n● |  On August 21, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with a non-affiliated third party (“Asset Seller”) pursuant to which the Company purchased certain machinery and equipment for stage performance for a total purchase price of $6,818,000, of which $3,000,000 shall be paid in cash and the remaining $3,818,000 shall be paid in the form of 6,060,318 ordinary shares. $2,000,000 of the cash consideration was paid in August 2020 and the remaining $1,000,000 was settled in November 2020 through a tri-party settlement agreement executed on September 29, 2020 among the Company, SK Purchaser and the Asset Seller.  \n---|---  \n● |  Payments of approximately $2.1 million to the online concert agent and performing artists for the Company’s “Color World Online Concert” held on September 10, 2020.  \n---|---  \n● |  Payments of approximately $3.8 million to the star agent and participating celebrities for contracting those celebrities to teach on Color World app.  \n---|---  \n● |  Payments of approximately $1.4 million for capital expenditure and other generated and administrative expenses.  \n---|---  \n  \nAs a result of the aforementioned transactions, the Company’s management is of the opinion that it has sufficient funds to meet the Company’s working capital requirements and contractual commitments and related obligations as they become due starting from one year from the date of this report.\n\n_Basis of presentation_\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all the directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and VIEs listed below.\n\n_Principles of consolidation_\n\nThe consolidated financial statements reflect the activities of the following subsidiaries and VIEs. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nSubsidiaries and VIEs  |  Place incorporated  |  Ownership percentage   \n---|---|---  \nCACM  |  New York, USA  |  100 |  %   \nBaytao  |  New York, USA  |  80 |  %   \nColor China  |  Hong Kong  |  100 |  %   \nBVI-ACM(1) |  British Virgin Island  |  100 |  %   \nChina-ACMH(1) |  Beijing, China  |  100 |  %   \nXin Ao(1) |  Beijing, China  |  VIE  \nSunway Kids(2) |  British Virgin Island  |  100 |  %   \n(1) |  The Company sold BVI-ACM and its subsidiaries to two former officers (CEO and CFO) who collectively held less than 5% ordinary shares of the Company currently for $600,000. See Note 4 – Discontinued operations for details.  \n---|---  \n(2) |  The Company sold Sunway Kids and its subsidiaries to a third party for $2.4 million in June 2020. See Note 4 – Discontinued operations for details.  \n---|---  \n  \nF-35\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n_Use of estimates and assumptions_\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The significant estimates and assumptions made in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts of other receivables, prepayments and advances and deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation, and fair value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Actual results could be materially different from those estimates. \n\n_Foreign currency translation_\n\nThe reporting currency of the Company, CACM, Baytao, and Color China is the U.S. dollar (“US$”). The functional currency of BVI-ACM is the U.S. dollar. China-ACMH and Xin Ao use their local currency, the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”) as their functional currency. In accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance on Foreign Currency Translation, the Company’s results of discontinued operations and cash flows are translated at the average exchange rates during the period, assets and liabilities of discontinued operations are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date, and equity is translated at historical exchange rates.\n\nAsset and liability accounts of discontinued operations at May 6, 2020 and June 30, 2019 were translated at RMB 7.06 and RMB 6.87 to US$1.00. Equity accounts are translated at their historical rate. The average translation rates applied to the consolidated statements of discontinued operations and comprehensive loss and cash flows from July 1, 2019 to May 6, 2020 and for the year ended June 30, 2019 were RMB 7.02 and RMB 6.83 to US$1.00, respectively. \n\nTranslation gains (losses) that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations. There were no foreign currency transaction gains or losses for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n\n_Discontinued operations_\n\nIn accordance with ASU No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results when the components of an entity meet the criteria in paragraph 205-20-45-1E to be classified as discontinued operations. When all of the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations are met, including management having the authority to approve the action and committing to a plan to sell the entity or the components, the major current assets, other assets, current liabilities, and noncurrent liabilities shall be reported as components of total assets and liabilities separate from the balances of the continuing operations. At the same time, the results of discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes (benefit), shall be reported as components of net income (loss) separate from the net income (loss) of continuing operations in accordance with ASC 205-20-45. See Note 4 – Discontinued operations.\n\n_Revenue recognition_\n\nOn July 1, 2018, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were not completed as of July 1, 2018. The core principle underlying this ASU is that the Company recognizes its revenue to represent the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in such exchange. This requires the Company to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time, based on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer. The Company’s revenue streams are primarily recognized at a point in time, principally upon music performance performed or education services provided.\n\nThe ASU requires the use of a five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that the Company (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation. The application of the five-step model to the revenue streams compared to the prior guidance did not result in significant changes in the way the Company records its revenue. Upon adoption, the Company evaluated its revenue recognition policy for all revenue streams within the scope of the ASU under previous standards and using the five-step model under the new guidance and confirmed that there were no material differences in the pattern of revenue recognition.\n\nF-36\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe Company accounts for a contract with a customer when the contract is committed in writing, the rights of the parties, including payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration to collect is substantially probable.\n\nWith the acquisition of Color China, the Company plans to offer the following services:\n\n(a) |  Online education academy  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company plans to earn revenue from its customers for subscription and tuition fees in connection with online courses to be instructed by individuals with extensive experience in the entertainment and/or music industries.\n\n(b) |  Online concert  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company holds online concerts with its star partners. Sale of online concert via subscription fee is accounted for as a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time on the day of the event. Online concert subscription fees are generally collected in advance and are initially recorded as deferred revenue. All ticket sales are final upon payment.\n\n(c) |  Online store  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company plans to hold an online marketplace for merchants to sell celebrity licensed or cobranded merchandise such as fashions, cosmetics, souvenirs, among others. The Company plans to charge commission fees to e-commerce merchants for selling in the Company’s online marketplace platform when the sales transaction is completed. The Company serves as an agent and its performance obligation is to arrange for the provision of the specified goods by those e-commerce merchants, and is not responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, and it does not have the ability to control the related shipping services. Upon completion of the sales transaction, the Company will charge the e-commerce merchants a fixed rate commission fee based on the sales amount. Commission fee revenues are recognized on a net basis at the point of delivery of products, net of a return allowance, if applicable.\n\nFor the year ended June 30, 2020, the Company did not earn any revenues from the aforementioned services. \n\nAs a practical expedient, the Company elects to record the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.\n\n_Financial instruments_\n\nUS GAAP specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques for determining the fair value of financial instruments and related fair value measurements based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs). The valuation hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. In accordance with FASB ASC 820, the following summarizes the fair value hierarchy:\n\nThe three levels of inputs are defined as follows:\n\nLevel 1 |  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;  \n---|---  \nLevel 2 |  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument;  \n---|---  \nLevel 3 |  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable.  \n---|---  \n  \nFinancial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at face value or cost, which approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rates of interest.\n\nF-37\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n_Cash and cash equivalents_\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\n_Other receivables_\n\nOther receivables primarily include security deposit and receivable from the disposal of its discontinued operation. Management regularly reviews the age of these receivables and changes in payment trends and will record an allowance for uncollectible when management believes collection of amounts due is at risk. Accounts considered uncollectible are written off against the allowance after exhaustive efforts at collection are made.\n\n_Prepayments and advances_\n\nPrepayments include funds deposited or advanced to outside vendors for future performance obligations, program license fees, vehicle purchase and service fees. As a standard practice in the music performance industry, many of the Company’s vendors require a certain amount to be deposited with them as a guarantee that the Company will complete its purchases on a timely basis. The Company has legally binding contracts with its vendors, the prepayments will be used to offset performance fees, program license fees, purchase price or service fees, and the amounts are refundable and bear no interest if outside vendors breach the contracts.\n\n_Property, plant and equipment_\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost or at fair value of the identifiable assets acquired on the acquisition date less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of each class of depreciable assets and is computed using the straight-line method with 0%-5% residual value.\n\nThe estimated useful lives of assets are as follows: \n\nUseful life  \n---  \nPerformance equipment |  10 years  \nOffice equipment |  5 years  \n  \n_Accounting for long-lived assets_\n\nThe Company classifies its long-lived assets into: (i) performance equipment; and (ii) office equipment.\n\nLong-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technological or other industry changes. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\n\nIf the value of an asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less disposition costs.\n\nThere were no impairment charges for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\nCompetitive pricing pressures and changes in interest rates could materially and adversely affect the Company’s estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by the long-lived assets, and thus could result in future impairment losses.\n\nF-38\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n_Leases_\n\nEffective July 1, 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842), and elected the practical expedients that does not require us to reassess: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are, or contain, leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (3) initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases. For lease terms of twelve months or fewer, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and liabilities. The Company also adopted the practical expedient that allows lessees to treat the lease and non-lease components of a lease as a single lease component.\n\nOperating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the adoption date of July 1, 2019 or the commencement date, whichever is earlier, based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since the implicit rate for the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company use its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments, in a similar economic environment and over a similar term.\n\nLease terms used to calculate the present value of lease payments generally do not include any options to extend, renew, or terminate the lease, as the Company does not have reasonable certainty at lease inception that these options will be exercised. The Company generally considers the economic life of its operating lease ROU assets to be comparable to the useful life of similar owned assets. The Company has elected the short-term lease exception, therefore operating lease ROU assets and liabilities do not include leases with a lease term of twelve months or less. Its leases generally do not provide a residual guarantee. The operating lease ROU asset also excludes lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet as operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.\n\nThe Company reviews the impairment of its ROU assets consistent with the approach applied for its other long-lived assets. The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on its ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows of the related operations. The Company has elected to include the carrying amount of operating lease liabilities in any tested asset group and include the associated operating lease payments in the undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows.\n\n_Stock-based compensation_\n\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for employees at fair value on the grant date and recognizes the expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The Company’s expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The expected life assumption is primarily based on historical exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of an option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s current and expected dividend policy.\n\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for non-employees at fair value on the grant date and recognizes the expense over the service provider’s requisite service period.\n\n_Income taxes_\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires the Company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Under this accounting standard, the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\n\nF-39\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nASC 740-10, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” defines uncertainty in income taxes and the evaluation of a tax position as a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of that position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met. Penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the period incurred. United States federal, state and local income tax returns for year 2018 and 2019 are subject to examination by any applicable tax authorities. PRC tax returns filed for calendar years ended December 31, 2017 to 2019 are subject to examination by the applicable tax authorities.\n\n_Earnings (loss) per share_\n\nThe Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires presentation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share in conjunction with the disclosure of the methodology used in computing such earnings per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts, such as warrants, options, restricted stock based grants and convertible preferred stock, to issue ordinary shares were exercised and converted into ordinary shares. Ordinary share equivalents having an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.\n\nDilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase ordinary shares at the average market price during the period. When the Company has a loss, no potential dilutive items are included since they would be antidilutive.\n\nStock dividends or stock splits are accounted for retroactively if the stock dividends or stock splits occur during the period, or retroactively if the stock dividends or stock splits occur after the end of the period but before the release of the financial statements, by considering it effective as of the beginning of the earliest period presented.\n\n_Comprehensive income (loss)_\n\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\n_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The amendments in this Update affect any entity that is required to apply the provisions of Topic 220, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income, and has items of other comprehensive income for which the related tax effects are presented in other comprehensive income as required by GAAP. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments in this Update is permitted, including adoption in any interim period, (1) for public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued and (2) for all other entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. The amendments in this Update should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recognized. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07 – Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees, which nonemployee share-based payment awards within the scope of Topic 718 are measured at grant-date fair value of the equity instruments that an entity is obligated to issue when the goods have been delivered or the service has been rendered and any other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments have been satisfied. The definition of the term grant date is amended to generally state the date at which a grantor and a grantee reach a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of a share based payment award. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nF-40\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement” (“ASU 2018-13”). ASU 2018-13 removes, modifies and adds certain disclosure requirements in Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurement”. ASU 2018-13 eliminates certain disclosures related to transfers and the valuations process, modifies disclosures for investments that are valued based on net asset value, clarifies the measurement uncertainty disclosure, and requires additional disclosures for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, which is an update to ASU Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduced the expected credit losses methodology for the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis, replacing the previous incurred loss methodology. The amendments in Update 2016-13 added Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses, and made several consequential amendments to the Codification. Update 2016-13 also modified the accounting for available-for-sale debt securities, which must be individually assessed for credit losses when fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, in accordance with Subtopic 326-30, Financial Instruments— Credit Losses—Available-for-Sale Debt Securities. The amendments in this Update address those stakeholders’ concerns by providing an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option for certain financial assets previously measured at amortized cost basis. For those entities, the targeted transition relief will increase comparability of financial statement information by providing an option to align measurement methodologies for similar financial assets. Furthermore, the targeted transition relief also may reduce the costs for some entities to comply with the amendments in Update 2016-13 while still providing financial statement users with decision-useful information. ASU 2019-05 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2023 as the Company is qualified as a smaller reporting company. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2019-05 may have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01 to clarify the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under ASC 321 and investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting in ASC 323 and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under ASC 815. With respect to the interactions between ASC 321 and ASC 323, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting when applying the measurement alternative in ASC 321, immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method of accounting. With respect to forward contracts or purchased options to purchase securities, the amendments clarify that when applying the guidance in ASC 815-10-15-141(a), an entity should not consider whether upon the settlement of the forward contract or exercise of the purchased option, individually or with existing investments, the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method in ASC 323 or the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825. The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Company does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\n__Reclassifications__\n\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year of discontinued operations presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on the accompanying statements of operations and cash flows.\n\n**Note 3 – Business Combinations**\n\n_Acquisition of Sunway Kids_\n\nIn order to expand the Company’s revenue capacity, on December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Share Exchange Agreement”) with Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”), a British Virgin Islands company, and the shareholders of Sunway Kids (the “Sellers of SK”), pursuant to which the Company will acquire all of the outstanding issued shares of Sunway Kids (the “SK Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Sunway Kids, the Company will issue 1,989,262 ordinary shares of the Company and pay two million U.S. dollars. On February 11, 2020, the Company, Sunway Kids and the Sellers of SK entered into an Amendment No. 1 (“Amendment 1”) to the Share Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to Amendment 1, the cash consideration will be payable to the Sellers of SK according to an earn-out schedule. On February 14, 2020, the SK Acquisition was closed and the Company issued 1,989,262 ordinary shares to the Sellers of SK. The shares had a fair value of approximately $1.9 million based on the closing market price of $0.95 per share on February, 14, 2020, the acquisition date. The total consideration was valued at approximately $3.6 million, which include approximately $1.7 million based upon a 5.8% discount rate of the $2.0 million earn-out payment schedule, and approximately $1.9 million for the shares issued. On June 25, 2020, Color Star, Sunway Kids, and the former shareholders of Sunway Kids entered into an Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment”) to the Share Exchange Agreement dated December 31, 2019, as amended. Pursuant to the Amendment 2, the Company shall not make any the Earn-out Payment to the former shareholders of Sunway Kids since Sunway Kids has been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and management of Sunway Kids believes it will be very difficult to achieve its projected financial results.\n\nF-41\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe Company’s acquisition of Sunway Kids was originally intended to be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805. Due to the negative impact of COVID-19, the Company disposed of Sunway Kids (see Note 4) within the same fiscal year as Sunway Kids was unable to conduct its normal operations and achieve it business plan. In addition, due to COVID-19, the Company was unable to complete its purchase price allocation and assessment on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date in accordance with the business combination standard issued by the FASB, prior to its disposal on June 25, 2020.\n\n_Acquisition of Color China_\n\nOn May 7, 2020, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with Color China, a Hong Kong limited company, and shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the outstanding issued shares of Color China from the sellers (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company will issue 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company and pay an aggregate of $2 million to the Sellers. Immediately after the Acquisition, Color Star will own 100% of Color China. On June 3, 2020, the transaction was closed and the Company issued 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company to the Sellers. Color China had no business operations other than holding a collection of music performance equipment.\n\nThe Company’s acquisition of Color China was accounted for as an acquisition of assets in accordance with ASC 805. The measurement is based on the fair value of the consideration given to acquire the assets (primarily performance and office equipment) held in Color China as it is more clearly evident and more reliably measurable. The total consideration given to acquire assets held in Color China at the acquisition date on June 3, 2020 were valued at approximately $4 million, consisted of 4,633,333 ordinary shares issued at a fair value of $1,963,607 based on the closing market price of $0.4238 per share on June 3, 2020, and cash payment of $2 million.\n\n**Note 4 – Discontinued Operations**\n\n_Disposal of BVI-ACM_\n\nThe Company’s concrete business was negatively affected by the economic cycle and government policies. The concrete industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The entire concrete industry in the Beijing area experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years as the Beijing government continues to enforce concrete production reformation and tightened environmental laws from late 2017 to date. The reformation causes great uncertainties for local enterprises in the construction market. Since 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down. Also, the Beijing government ordered the suspension of construction job sites during winters to reduce air pollution since 2017. The operations of Xin Ao were also severely affected. As a result of Xin Ao’s deteriorating cash position, it defaulted on bank loans and experienced a substantial increase in contingent liabilities. The Company believed it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to turn around the concrete business. Accordingly, the Company’s management decided to dispose of this business by actively seeking a purchaser after the acquisition of Sunway Kids.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company, BVI-ACM, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He (the “Purchasers”), two former officers (CEO and CFO) and collectively held less than 5% ordinary shares of the Company currently, entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the Purchasers agreed to purchase BVI-ACM in exchange for cash consideration of $600,000. Upon the closing of the transaction (the “Disposition”) the Purchasers assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and VIE entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The closing of the Disposition was completed on May 6, 2020. After disposal of BVI-ACM, the Company had no continuing involvement or commitments with BVI-ACM.\n\nF-42\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.

Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the SK Purchaser agreed to purchase Sunway Kids in exchange for cash consideration of $2.4 million. Upon closing of the transaction, the SK Purchaser became the sole shareholder of Sunway Kids and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities (the “VIE”) owned or controlled by Sunway Kids. The SK Purchaser settled $1.0 million of its payment obligation in November 2020 through a tri-party settlement agreement executed on September 29, 2020 among the Company, SK Purchaser and the Asset Seller. Although the SK Purchaser is current with its installment payment, the Company will recognize the remaining installment payment on a cash basis as collectability of the remaining $1.4 million cannot be reasonably assured. The disposition of Sunway Kids resulted in the recognition of a loss of approximately $0.8 million that is recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the caption of “loss from discontinued operations.”\n\nThe reconciliation of loss on sale of discontinued operations of Sunway Kids are as follows:\n\nJune 25, 2020 (unaudited)  \n---  \nTotal consideration paid  |  $ |  3,583,952   \nForgiven of fair value of earn out payment  |  (1,694,153 |  )   \nExpenses incurred from February 14 to June 25, 2020  |  (54,729 |  )   \nTotal consideration received  |  (1,000,000 |  )   \nTotal loss on sale of discontinued operations  |  $ |  835,070   \n  \n_Revenue recognition by Sunway Kids_\n\nWhile owned by the Company, Sunway Kids was in the business of delivering artificial intelligence lessons for kids and it earned tuition fees in connection with lessons completed. Each lesson would be accounted for as a single performance obligation and tuition revenue would be recognized proportionately as the lessons are delivered. Tuition fees were generally collected in advance and would be initially recorded as deferred revenue. Refund for any remaining lessons (which amount is limited to the amount related to the undelivered classes) is offered to students who decide to withdraw from a lesson.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sunway Kids had no business operations and did not earn any revenue from February 14, 2020 to June 25, 2020 as management was unable to conduct its normal operations.\n\n**Note 5 – Other receivables**\n\nOther receivables consisted of the following:\n\nJune 30, 2020  |  June 30, 2019   \n---|---  \nRent deposit  |  $ |  2,300  |  $ |  2,300   \nReceivables from disposal of Sunway Kids (1)  |  1,000,000  |  -   \nOther receivables  |  $ |  1,002,300  |  $ |  2,300   \n(1) |  The SK Purchaser promised to pay $2.4 million to the Company as per the executed agreement and it had subsequently settled $1.0 million of its payment obligations through a tri-party settlement agreement executed on September 29, 2020 among the Company, SK Purchaser and the Asset Seller.

Management believes that the realization of the benefits from these losses appears uncertain due to the Company’s operating history and continued losses in the U.S. If the Company is unable to generate taxable income in its United States operations, it is more likely than not that it will not have sufficient income to utilize its deferred tax assets. Accordingly, the Company has provided a 100% valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets of approximately $134,000 and $50,000 related to its U.S. operations as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nChanges in the value allowance for deferred tax assets increased by $84,259 from $50,256 at June 30, 2019 to $134,515 at June 30, 2020.\n\n**(b)** |  **Uncertain tax positions**  \n---|---  \n  \nThere were no uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, management does not anticipate any potential future adjustments which would result in a material change to its tax positions.

We strive to offer students professional artist training platform featuring exclusive content and live interaction. Our mission is to use our know-how and deep industry connections to deliver a world-class entertainment learning experiences and to promote entertainment exchange between the United States and China. We launched our online platform Color World on September 10, 2020, and it is currently operating in China. The curriculum created by us includes music, sports, animation, painting and calligraphy, film and television, life skills. At present, we have signed contracts with well-known international artists and more than 50 celebrity teachers have been retained to launch online lectures. The Color World platform not only has celebrity lectures, but also celebrity concert videos, celebrity peripheral products, such as celebrity branded merchandise, and artist interactive communication. We strive to build an all-star cultural and entertainment industry chain. To establish a new entertainment industry chain combining online and offline options, we plan to establish offline education institutions. The offline education base will train during the day and perform at night. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our plan to establish the offline education base has been delayed. We will adjust our plan in accordance with the development of COVID-19.\n\nThe management believes that we have strong industry resources and influence to become a comprehensive online academy for global “future stars”. We were formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd., and changed our name to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd. in May 2020. Prior to our acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, our core business had been focusing on the concrete business in China.\n\nColor Star Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.) was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C-corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, we changed our name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc.\n\n1\n\nOn August 20, 2018, CACM was incorporated in the State of New York and is wholly owned by us. The establishment of CACM was to expand the Company’s business in the U.S. CACM has not commenced operations. \n\nOn December 27, 2018, we consummated a re-domicile merger pursuant to which we merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Cayman Islands exempted company and the surviving entity in the merger. As a result of the reincorporation, we are now governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nOn July 16, 2019, upon effectiveness of the amendment and restatement of our memorandum and articles of association which was approved by our shareholders, our name was changed from China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. to Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”) and its shareholders. On February 14, 2020, we consummated the acquisition of Sunway Kids whereby we issued 1,989,262 Ordinary Shares and $2 million of cash to be paid in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sunway Kids. The $2 million cash consideration is payable in five installments over five years according to an earn-out schedule. Sunway Kids thereby became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Sunway Kids was established on February 29, 2012, under the laws of the British Virgin Islands as an offshore holding company. On August 23, 2018, Sunway Kids established its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brave Millenium Limited (“Brave Millenium”) under the laws of Hong Kong. On December 4, 2019, Brave Millenium established Chengdu Hengshanghui Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. (“Chengdu Hengshanghui”) in China as a wholly foreign owned limited liability company (the “WFOE”). On December 9, 2019, Chengdu Hengshanghui entered into a series of variable interest entity agreements with Chengdu Hengshanghui Education Consulting Co., Ltd. (“Hengshanghui Education”). Through Sunway Kids and its variable interest entity Hengshanghui Education, we were engaged in providing education and health services to day-care and preschools in China.\n\nOn March 10, 2020, CACM entered into a certain joint venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Baydolphin, Inc., a company organized under the laws of New York (“Baydolphin”). Pursuant to the JV Agreement, CACM and Baydolphin established a limited liability company under the laws of New York, Baytao LLC (“Baytao”) that is intended to be the 100% owner of one or more operating entities in the United States to engage in the business of online and offline after-school education.\n\nPrior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, our core business has been the concrete business in China. Our concrete business was negatively affected by the economic cycle and government policies. The concrete industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The entire concrete industry in the PRC’s Beijing area experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years as the Beijing government continues to enforce concrete production reformation and tightened environmental laws from late 2017 to date. The reformation causes great uncertainties for local enterprises in the construction market. Since 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down. Also, the Beijing government ordered the suspension of construction jobsites during winters to reduce air pollution since 2017. The operations of Xin Ao were also severely affected. As a result of the Company’s deteriorating cash position, we defaulted on bank loans and experienced a substantial increase in contingent liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, we have defaulted on a bank loan of $24,345,129. As of December 31, 2019, Xin Ao was subject to several civil lawsuits for which the Company estimated that it is more than likely to pay judgments in the amount of approximately $6.8 million (including interest and penalties of $1.6 million). During the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were additional estimated claims of approximately $0.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively. We believed it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to turn around the concrete business. As a result, we sought to dispose of the concrete business after the acquisition of Sunway Kids.\n\nOn May 6, 2020, we completed the disposition (the “Xin Ao Disposition”) of Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (“BVI-ACM”), after obtaining our shareholders’ approval on April 27, 2020 and satisfaction or waiver of all other closing conditions. Upon the closing of the Xin Ao Disposition, Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He became the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The proceeds of $600,000 from the Xin Ao Disposition have been used for the Company’s working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nOn April 27, 2020, upon effectiveness of the amendment and restatement of its memorandum and articles of association (which was approved by our shareholders), our name was changed to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.\n\n2\n\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”), a Hong Kong limited company, and shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, we acquired all of the outstanding issued shares and other equity interests in Color China from the sellers (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Color China, we issued 4,633,333 Ordinary Shares of the Company and paid an aggregate of $2,000,000 to the sellers.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the Company and the former shareholders of Sunway Kids entered into an Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment”) to the Share Exchange Agreement dated December 31, 2019, as amended. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company shall not make any Earn-out Payment to the former shareholders of Sunway Kids since Sunway Kids has been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and management of Sunway Kids believes it will be very difficult to achieve its projected financial results. On the same day, Sunway Kids and Yanliang Han (the “Purchaser”), an unrelated third party, entered into certain share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the Purchaser agreed to purchase Sunway Kids for cash consideration of $2.4 million consisting of $400,000 which shall be paid within a month of closing, and $2,000,000 to be paid in monthly installments of $200,000 over 10 months. Upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Disposition SPA on June 25, 2020, the Purchaser became the sole shareholder of Sunway Kids and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by Sunway Kids.\n\nEffective October 1, 2020, we changed the ticker symbol of its Ordinary Shares traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market from “HHT” to “CSCW”, representing the abbreviation of “Color Star Color World.” This is the new focus of our business.\n\n**Organizational structure**\n\nBelow is the Company’s corporate structure chart as of the date of this prospectus.\n\n![](img_002.jpg)\n\n3\n\n**_Recent Developments_**\n\n_Securities Purchase Agreement_\n\nOn March 27, 2021, we sold in a private placement of 3,000,000 ordinary shares at $1.3 per share for an aggregate offering price of $3,900,000.\n\nOn March 25, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Wang MinYe, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to the Wang MingYe in a private placement 3,000,000 ordinary shares at a purchase price of $1.30 per share for an aggregate offering price of $3,900,000.\n\nOn March 25, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Lin YiHan, pursuant to which we sold to Lin YiHan 3,500,000 ordinary shares at a purchase price of $1.30 per share for an aggregate offering price of $4,550,000.\n\nOn February 18, 2021, we entered into certain securities purchase agreement with certain investors, pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 20,000,000 units, each unit consisting of one ordinary share and a warrant to purchase one share with an initial exercise price of $1.34 per share, at a price of $1.30 per unit, for an aggregate purchase price of $26,000,000.

(the “Company”), effective June 16, 2021. Mr. Lu’s resignation is not the result of any disagreement with the Company’s operations, policies or procedures.\n\nConcurrently, upon recommendation by the Nominating Committee and the Compensation Committee, the Board approved and confirmed the appointment of Basil Wilson as the Chairman of the Boar and appointment of Biao Lu as the Chief Artistic Officer of the Company. \n\n_Change of Independent Accounting Firm_\n\nOn April 7, 2021, the Audit Committee (the “Audit Committee”) of Board of Directors of the Company dismissed Wei, Wei & Co., LLP (“Wei Wei”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.\n\nThe audit reports of Wei Wei on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the Company’s fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, there were no disagreements between the Company and Wei Wei on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which disagreement(s), if not resolved to Wei Wei’s satisfaction, would have caused Wei Wei to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in its reports on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for such periods.\n\nOn April 7, 2021, the Audit Committee approved the appointment of Audit Alliance LLP (“Audit Alliance”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to perform independent audit services for the year ended June 30, 2021. During the two fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 and through the subsequent interim period to April 6, 2021, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted Audit Alliance regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or on the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company that Audit Alliance concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of either a disagreement or a reportable event as described above.\n\n_Regain Nasdaq compliance_\n\nOn October 16, 2020, the Company received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Exchange regarding the Company’s failure to comply with Nasdaq Continued Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. A failure to comply with Rule 5550(a)(2) exists when listed securities fail to maintain a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days (including, in particular, the period September 3, 2020 through October 15, 2020), the Company failed to meet the aforesaid requirement.\n\nOn April 7, 2021, the Company received a written notification from the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Qualifications Staff indicating that the Company has regained compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”) and that the matter is now closed.\n\n**Impact of COVID-19**\n\nThe Company’s operations are affected by the recent and ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which in March 2020 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 outbreak is causing lockdowns, travel restrictions, and closures of businesses. Our business has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak to a certain extent.\n\nThe Company’s operations in China and the United States have been materially affected. New York, where the Company’s U.S. operations are based, have been significantly affected by COVID-19, which led to measures taken by the New York government trying to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as reduction on the number of people in gathering and travel restrictions. Additional travel and other restrictions may be put in place to further control the outbreak in United States. Accordingly, our operation and business have been and will continue to be adversely affected as the results of the wide-spread pandemic. Management may have to adjust or change business plans in response to the prolonged pandemic and change of social behavior.\n\n5\n\nThe extent to which COVID-19 negatively impacts the business is highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. The Company believes that the coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to control it may have a significant negative impact on not only the business, but economic activities globally. The magnitude of this negative effect on the continuity of the business operation in China and U.S. remains uncertain. These uncertainties impede the Company’s ability to conduct daily operations and could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result affect the Company’s stock price and create more volatility.\n\nBased on assessment of current economic environment, customer demand and sales trend, and the negative impact from COVID-19 outbreak and spread, there is an uncertainty that the Company’s revenue and operating cash flows may be significantly lower than expected for fiscal year 2021.\n\n**Corporate Information**\n\nWe are a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability and conduct business in China through subsidiaries in China. Our principal executive office is located at 800 3rd Ave, Suite 2800, New York, NY 10022. Our telephone number is +1 (212) 220-3967. We maintain a website at https://colorstarinternational.com/ that contains information about our Company, though no information contained on our website is part of this prospectus.\n\n**Implication of Being a Foreign Private Issuer**\n\nWe are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). As such, we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to U.S. domestic public companies. For example:\n\n● | we are not required to provide as many Exchange Act reports or provide periodic and current reports as frequently, as a domestic public company;  \n---|---  \n● | for interim reporting, we are permitted to comply solely with our home country requirements, which are less rigorous than the rules that apply to domestic public companies;  \n---|---  \n● | we are not required to provide the same level of disclosure on certain issues, such as executive compensation;  \n---|---  \n● | we are exempt from provisions of Regulation FD aimed at preventing issuers from making selective disclosures of material information;  \n---|---  \n● | we are not required to comply with the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act; and  \n---|---  \n● | we are not required to comply with Section 16 of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their share ownership and trading activities and establishing insider liability for profits realized from any “short-swing” trading transaction.  \n---|---  \n  \n6\n\n**The Offering**\n\nOrdinary shares offered by Selling shareholders | Up to 20,000,000 Units, with each Unit consisting of one ordinary share and one warrant to purchase one ordinary share.  \n---|---  \nSelling shareholders | See “Selling shareholders”  \nOrdinary shares outstanding | 90,356,629 ordinary shares  \nOrdinary shares outstanding after the offering | Up to 90,356,629 ordinary shares  \nNasdaq Capital Market symbol | CSCW  \nUse of Proceeds | We have not made, and do not need to make, any payments to any affiliate of the Selling shareholders, or any person with whom the Selling shareholders has a contractual relationship.  \nRisk Factors | The investment of our ordinary shares involves substantial risks. See “Risk Factors” in this prospectus and under “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk factors” in the Amendment to 2020 Annual Report, incorporated by reference herein, and other information included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus for a discussion of factors you should carefully consider before investing in our ordinary shares.  \nDividend policy | We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our shares, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. See “Dividend Policy.”  \n  \n7\n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n_You should carefully consider the risks incorporated by reference in this prospectus before making an investment decision. You should also consider the matters described below and in “Risk Factors” in “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk factors” in the Form 20-F/A, and all of the information included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus before deciding whether to purchase our ordinary shares. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties. In that case, the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”_\n\n**_The price of our ordinary shares historically has been volatile, which may affect the price at which you could sell the ordinary shares._**\n\nOur ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CSCW.” The market price for the ordinary shares has varied between a high bid price of $2.67 on March 30, 2021 and a low bid price of $0.44 on September 25, 2020 in the 12-month period ended on June 21, 2021. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell the ordinary shares. The ordinary share price are likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the following:\n\n● | variations in our revenues, earnings and cash flows;  \n---|---  \n● | announcements of new investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors;  \n● | announcements of new offerings, solutions and expansions by us or our competitors;  \n● | changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;  \n● | detrimental adverse publicity about us, our services or our industry;  \n● | announcements of new regulations, rules or policies relevant for our business;  \n● | additions or departures of key personnel;  \n● | release of lockup or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding equity securities or sales of additional equity securities; and  \n● | potential litigation or regulatory investigations.  \n---|---  \n  \nAny of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our ordinary shares will trade.\n\nIn the past, shareholders of public companies have often brought securities class action suits against those companies following periods of instability in the market price of their securities. If we were to be involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management’s attention and other resources from our business and operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit, which could harm our results of operations. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n8\n\n**_We do not intend to pay dividends on our ordinary shares for the foreseeable future, but if we intend to do so our holding company structure may limit the payment of dividends to our stockholders._**\n\nWhile we have no current intention of paying dividends, should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including as a result of restrictive covenants in loan agreements, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions as discussed below. If future dividends are paid in RMB, fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of RMB into U.S. dollars may reduce the amount received by U.S. stockholders upon conversion of the dividend payment into U.S. dollars.\n\nChinese regulations currently permit the payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. Our subsidiaries in China are also required to set aside a portion of their after tax profits according to Chinese accounting standards and regulations to fund certain reserve funds. Currently, our subsidiaries in China are the only sources of revenues or investment holdings for the payment of dividends. If they do not accumulate sufficient profits under Chinese accounting standards and regulations to first fund certain reserve funds as required by Chinese accounting standards, we will be unable to pay any dividends.\n\n**_We may be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling our ordinary shares._**\n\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called “penny stocks” to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. If our ordinary shares becomes a “penny stock”, we may become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the “Penny Stock Rule”. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market.\n\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our ordinary shares will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our ordinary shares were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\n\n**_If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding the ordinary shares, the market price for the ordinary shares and trading volume could decline._**\n\nThe trading market for our ordinary shares will be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business. If industry or securities analysts decide to cover us and in the future downgrade our ordinary shares, the market price for our ordinary shares would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price or trading volume for our ordinary shares to decline.\n\n9\n\n**_Techniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of our ordinary shares._**\n\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller’s interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a security short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market.\n\nPublic companies that have substantially all of their operations in the PRC have been the subject of short selling. Much of the scrutiny and negative publicity has centered on allegations of a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting resulting in financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result, many of these companies are now conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations and, in the interim, are subject to shareholder lawsuits and/or SEC enforcement actions.\n\nIt is not clear what effect such negative publicity could have on us. If we were to become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we could have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. While we would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller by principles of freedom of speech, applicable law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation could be costly and time-consuming, and could distract our management from growing our business. Even if such allegations are ultimately proven to be groundless, allegations against us could severely impact our business operations, and any investment in our ordinary shares could be greatly reduced or even rendered worthless.\n\n**_We are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to U.S. domestic public companies._**\n\nBecause we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and regulations in the United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including:\n\n● | the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K;  \n---|---  \n● | the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act;  \n---|---  \n● | the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and  \n---|---  \n● | the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe are required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we intend to publish our semi-annual results as press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Press releases relating to financial results and material events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information that would be made available to you were you investing in a U.S. domestic issuer.\n\n**_Because we are a foreign private issuer and are exempt from certain Nasdaq corporate governance standards applicable to U.S. issuers, you will have less protection than you would have if we were a domestic issuer._**\n\nNasdaq Listing Rules require listed companies to have, among other things, a majority of their board members be independent. As a foreign private issuer, however, we are permitted to, and we may, follow home country practice in lieu of the above requirements, or we may choose to comply with the Nasdaq requirement within one year of listing. The corporate governance practice in our home country, the Cayman Islands, does not require a majority of our board to consist of independent directors. Since a majority of our board of directors will not consist of independent directors, fewer board members will be exercising independent judgment and the level of board oversight on the management of our company may decrease as a result. In addition, the Nasdaq listing rules also require U.S. domestic issuers to have a compensation committee, a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors, and an audit committee with a minimum of three members. As a foreign private issuer, we are not subject to these requirements. The Nasdaq listing rules may require shareholder approval for certain corporate matters, such as requiring that shareholders be given the opportunity to vote on all equity compensation plans and material revisions to those plans and certain ordinary share issuances. We intend to comply with the requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rules in determining whether shareholder approval is required on such matters and to appoint a nominating and corporate governance committee. However, we may consider following home country practice in lieu of the requirements under Nasdaq listing rules with respect to certain corporate governance standards which may afford less protection to investors.\n\n10\n\n**MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA**\n\nThis prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference herein contain industry, market and competitive position data that are based on industry publications and studies conducted by third parties as well as our own internal estimates and research. These industry publications and third-party studies generally state that the information that they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information.\n\n11\n\n**CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis prospectus contains forward-looking statements. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this prospectus, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy, transformation, strategic priorities and future progress, are forward-looking statements.

We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this prospectus and are subject to a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including the factors described in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and/or “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” in the 2020 Annual Report incorporated by reference herein.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty the particular use for the net proceeds we may receive. Accordingly, we will retain broad discretion over the use of these proceeds, if any. We have not made, and do not need to make, any payments to any affiliate of the Selling shareholders, or any person with whom the Selling shareholders has a contractual relationship.\n\n14\n\n**SELLING SHAREHOLDERS**\n\nWe are registering the ordinary shares in order to permit the Selling shareholders to offer the shares for resale from time to time.

We anticipate that we will retain any earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business. Therefore, we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including future earnings, capital requirements, financial conditions and future prospects and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant.\n\nUnder Cayman Islands law and our Articles of Association, we may pay a dividend out of either profits or our share premium account but a dividend may not be paid if this would result in the company being unable to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business.\n\nIf we determine to pay dividends on any of our ordinary shares in the future, as a holding company, we will depend on receipt of funds from Color China. Current Chinese regulations permit our China Operating Companies to pay dividends to Color Star only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our subsidiaries in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Our China Operating Companies are also required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund, although the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion of its board of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. Our subsidiaries in China are required to set aside statutory reserves and have done so.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to the China Enterprise Income Tax Law (“EIT Law”) and its implementation rules, dividends generated after January 1, 2008 and distributed to us by Color China are subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10% unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties or arrangements between the Chinese central government and governments of other countries or regions where the non-Chinese-resident enterprises are incorporated.\n\nUnder existing Chinese foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. Specifically, under the existing exchange restrictions, without prior approval of SAFE, cash generated from the operations in China may be used to pay dividends to our company.\n\n16\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF ORDINARY SHARES**\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, we are authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 ordinary shares of $0.001 par value per share.\n\nThe following are summaries of the material provisions of our Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company, as amended, insofar as they relate to the material terms of our ordinary shares. Copies of our Memorandum and Articles of Association are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.\n\n**Ordinary shares**\n\n**_Ordinary Shares_**\n\nThe following are summaries of material provisions of our Memorandum and Articles, corporate governance policies and the Companies Act insofar as they relate to the material terms of our Ordinary Shares.\n\n**_Objects of Our Company_**\n\nUnder our Memorandum and Articles, the objects of our Company are unrestricted and we have the full power and authority to carry out any object not prohibited by the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\n**_Share Capital_**\n\nThe holders of our Ordinary Shares are entitled to one vote for each such share held and shall be entitled to notice of any shareholders’ meeting, and, subject to the terms of Memorandum and Articles, to vote thereat.\n\n**_Dividends_**\n\nThe holders of our Ordinary Shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by our Board of Directors subject to the Companies Act and to our Memorandum and Articles.\n\n**_Voting Rights_**\n\nIn respect of all matters subject to a shareholders’ vote, each Ordinary Share is entitled to one vote. Voting at any shareholders’ meeting is by show of hands unless a poll is demanded by the chairman or persons holding certain amounts of shares as set forth in the Memorandum and Articles. Actions that may be taken at a general meeting also may be taken by a unanimous resolution of the shareholders in writing.\n\nNo business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of members is present at the time when the meeting proceeds to business; two members present in person or by proxy shall be a quorum provided always that if the Company has one member of record the quorum shall be that one member present in person or by proxy. An ordinary resolution to be passed at a general meeting requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes cast.\n\nA special resolution of members is required to change the name of the Company, approve a merger, wind up the Company, amend the Memorandum and Articles and reduce the share capital.\n\n**_Transfer of Ordinary Shares_**\n\nSubject to the restrictions set out below, any of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his, its or her Ordinary Shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or any other form approved by our Board of Directors or in a form prescribed by the stock exchange on which our shares are then listed.\n\nOur Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, decline to register any transfer of Ordinary Shares whether or not it is fully paid up to the total consideration paid for such shares. Our directors may also decline to register any transfer of Ordinary Shares if (a) the instrument of transfer is not accompanied by the certificate covering the shares to which it relates or any other evidence as our Board of Directors may reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor to, or his/her right to transfer the shares; or (b) the instrument of transfer is in respect of more than one class of shares.\n\n17\n\nIf our directors refuse to register a transfer, they shall, within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to the transferee notice of such refusal.\n\nThe registration of transfers may be suspended and the register closed at such times and for such periods as our Board of Directors may from time to time determine, provided, however, that the registration of transfers shall not be suspended nor the register closed for more than 30 days in any year.\n\n**_Winding-Up/Liquidation_**\n\nOn a return of capital on winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares), a liquidator may be appointed to determine how to distribute the assets among the holders of the Ordinary Shares. If our assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay all of the paid-up capital, the assets will be distributed so that the losses are borne by our shareholders proportionately; a similar basis will be employed if the assets are more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital at the commencement of the winding up.\n\n**_Calls on Ordinary Shares and Forfeiture of Ordinary Shares_**\n\nOur Board of Directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their Ordinary Shares in a notice served to such shareholders at least 14 days prior to the specified time and place of payment. The shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid on the specified time are subject to forfeiture.\n\n**_Redemption of Shares_**\n\nWe may issue shares on terms that are subject to redemption, at our option or at the option of the holders, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by our Board of Directors.\n\n**_Inspection of Books and Records_**\n\nDirectors shall from time to time determine whether and to what extent and at what times and places and under what conditions or regulations the accounts and books of the Company or any of them shall be open to the inspection of members not being Directors and no member (not being a Director) shall have any right of inspecting any account or book or document of the Company except as conferred by Companies Act or authorized by the Directors or by the Company in a general meeting. However, the Directors shall from time to time cause to be prepared and to be laid before the Company in a general meeting, profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, group accounts (if any) and such other reports and accounts as may be required by Companies Act. (See “Where You Can Find More Information”)\n\n**_Issuance of Additional Shares_**\n\nOur Memorandum and Articles authorize our Board of Directors to issue additional Ordinary Shares from time to time as our Board of Directors shall determine, to the extent there are available authorized but unissued shares.\n\nOur Memorandum and Articles also authorizes our Board of Directors to issue all or any part of its capital with or without preference, priority or special privilege or subject to any restriction.\n\n18\n\n**_Anti-Takeover Provisions_**\n\nSome provisions of our Memorandum and Articles may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company or management that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that:\n\n● | authorize our Board of Directors to issue ordinary shares with preference rights in one or more series and to designate the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such ordinary shares with preference rights without any further vote or action by our shareholders (subject to variation of rights of shares provisions in our Memorandum and Articles); and  \n---|---  \n● | limit the ability of shareholders to requisition and convene general meetings of shareholders. Our Memorandum and Articles allow our shareholders holding shares representing in aggregate not less than one-fourth of our paid up share capital (as to the total consideration paid for such shares) in issue to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders, in which case our directors are obliged to call such meeting and to put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting.  \n  \nHowever, under Cayman Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under our Memorandum and Articles for a proper purpose and for what they believe in good faith to be in the best interests of our Company.\n\n**Warrants**\n\nThe following summary of certain terms and provisions of the warrants that are being offered hereby is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the provisions of the warrants, the form of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Prospective investors should carefully review the terms and provisions of the form of warrant for a complete description of the terms and conditions of the warrants.\n\n_Exercise Price and Duration._ Each share exercisable pursuant to the warrants will have an exercise price per share of US$1.34. The warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance, and at any time thereafter up to the third anniversary of the issuance date. The exercise price is subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting our Class A ordinary share and also upon any distributions of assets, including cash, stock or other property to our shareholders. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. A warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares. As a result, you must purchase Units in multiples of two in order to obtain full value from the fractional interest.\n\n_Exercisability._ The warrants will be exercisable, at the option of each holder, in whole or in part by delivering to us a duly executed exercise notice and by payment in full in immediately available funds for the number of Class A ordinary shares purchased upon such exercise.\n\n_Cashless Exercise_. If at the third-month anniversary of the issuance date, there is no effective registration statement registering, or the prospectus contained therein is not available for the issuance of the ordinary shares underlying the warrants, then the warrants may also be exercised, in whole or in part, at such time by means of a cashless exercise, in which case the holder would receive upon such exercise the net number of ordinary shares determined according to the formula set forth in the warrant.\n\n_Exercise Limitation._ A holder will not have the right to exercise any portion of the warrant if the holder (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% (or 9.99% upon the request of the holder) of the number of ordinary shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the warrants. However, any holder may increase or decrease such percentage, provided that any increase will not be effective until the 61st day after such election.\n\n_Transferability_. Subject to applicable laws, the warrants may be offered for sale, sold, transferred or assigned without our consent.\n\n_Fractional Shares._ No fractional ordinary shares will be issued upon the exercise of the warrants. A warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares.\n\n_Trading Market_. There is no established public trading market for the warrants being issued in this offering, and we do not expect a market to develop. We do not intend to apply for listing of the warrants on any securities exchange or other nationally recognized trading system. Without an active trading market, the liquidity of the warrants will be limited.\n\n19\n\n**MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN U.S. CORPORATE LAW AND CAYMAN ISLANDS CORPORATE LAW**\n\nThe Companies Act is modeled after that of English law but does not follow many recent English law statutory enactments. In addition, the Companies Act differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the significant differences between the provisions of the Companies Act applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the State of Delaware.\n\n**_Mergers and Similar Arrangements_**. A merger of two or more constituent companies under Cayman Islands law requires a plan of merger or consolidation to be approved by the directors of each constituent company and authorization by (a) a special resolution of the shareholders and (b) such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company’s articles of association.\n\nA merger between a Cayman Islands parent company and its Cayman Islands subsidiary or subsidiaries does not require authorization by a resolution of shareholders of that Cayman Islands subsidiary if a copy of the plan of merger is given to every member of that Cayman Islands subsidiary to be merged unless that member agrees otherwise. For this purpose, a subsidiary is a company of which at least ninety percent (90%) of the issued shares entitled to vote are owned by the parent company. However, it is noted that the Company’s Articles provide that approval of a special resolution of shareholders is required.\n\nThe consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest over a constituent company is required unless this requirement is waived by a court in the Cayman Islands.\n\nSave in certain circumstances, a dissentient shareholder of a Cayman constituent company is entitled to payment of the fair value of his shares upon dissenting to a merger or consolidation. The exercise of appraisal rights will preclude the exercise of any other rights save for the right to seek relief on the grounds that the merger or consolidation is void or unlawful.\n\nIn addition, there are statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, provided that the arrangement is approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made, and who must in addition represent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meetings, convened for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not to be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that:\n\n● | the statutory provisions as to the required majority vote have been met;  \n---|---  \n● | the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the statutory majority are acting bona fide without coercion of the minority to promote interests adverse to those of the class;  \n---|---  \n● | the arrangement is such that may be reasonably approved by an intelligent and honest man of that class acting in respect of his interest; and  \n---|---  \n● | the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Act.  \n---|---  \n  \nWhen a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90.0% of the shares within four months, the offeror may, within a two-month period commencing on the expiration of such four month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands but this is unlikely to succeed in the case of an offer which has been so approved unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith or collusion.\n\nIf an arrangement and reconstruction is thus approved, the dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights, which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of Delaware corporations, providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares.\n\n20\n\n**_Shareholders’ Suits._** In principle, we will normally be the proper plaintiff and as a general rule a derivative action may not be brought by a minority shareholder. However, based on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority in the Cayman Islands, there are exceptions to the foregoing principle, including when:\n\n● | a company acts or proposes to act illegally or ultra vires;  \n---|---  \n● | the act complained of, although not ultra vires, could only be effected duly if authorized by more than a simple majority vote that has not been obtained; and  \n---|---  \n● | those who control the company are perpetrating a “fraud on the minority.”  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability_**. Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our current memorandum and articles of association permit indemnification of officers and directors for losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred in their capacities as such unless such losses or damages arise from dishonesty of such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers that provide such persons with additional indemnification beyond that provided in our current memorandum and articles of association.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\n\n**_Directors’ Fiduciary Duties_** _._ Under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director acts in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He must not use his corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, the director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.\n\nAs a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and therefore it is considered that he or she owes the following duties to the company — a duty to act bona fide in the best interests of the company, a duty not to make a profit based on his or her position as director (unless the company permits him or her to do so) and a duty not to put himself or herself in a position where the interests of the company conflict with his or her personal interest or his or her duty to a third party. A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his or her duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his or her knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands.\n\n**_Shareholder Action by Written Consent_**. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written consent by amendment to its certificate of incorporation. Cayman Islands law and our current articles of association provide that shareholders may approve corporate matters by way of a unanimous written resolution signed by or on behalf of each shareholder who would have been entitled to vote on such matter at a general meeting without a meeting being held.\n\n21\n\n**_Shareholder Proposals_**. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, provided it complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized to do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings.\n\nCayman Islands law does not provide shareholders any right to put proposals before a meeting or requisition a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in articles of association. Our current articles of association allow our shareholders holding not less than one-fourth of all voting power of our share capital in issue to requisition a shareholder’s meeting. Other than this right to requisition a shareholders’ meeting, our current articles of association do not provide our shareholders other right to put proposal before a meeting. As a Cayman Islands exempted company, we are not obliged by law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings.\n\n**_Cumulative Voting._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation’s certificate of incorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since it permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder’s voting power with respect to electing such director. There are no prohibitions in relation to cumulative voting under the laws of the Cayman Islands but our current articles of association do not provide for cumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation.\n\n**_Removal of Directors._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our current articles of association, directors may be removed with or without cause, by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders.\n\n**_Transactions with Interested Shareholders._** The Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware corporations whereby, unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an “interested shareholder” for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder generally is a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target’s outstanding voting share within the past three years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target’s board of directors.\n\nCayman Islands law has no comparable statute. As a result, we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the Delaware business combination statute. However, although Cayman Islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders, it does provide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and not with the effect of constituting a fraud on the minority shareholders.\n\n**_Dissolution; Winding up._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution must be approved by shareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board. Under Cayman Islands law, a company may be wound up by either an order of the courts of the Cayman Islands or by a special resolution of its members or, if the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, by an ordinary resolution of its members. The court has authority to order winding up in a number of specified circumstances including where it is, in the opinion of the court, just and equitable to do so. Under the Companies Act and our current articles of association, our company may be dissolved, liquidated or wound up by a special resolution of our shareholders.\n\n22\n\n**_Variation of Rights of Shares._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of such class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under Cayman Islands law and our current articles of association, if our share capital is divided into more than one class of shares, we may vary the rights attached to any class with the written consent of the holders of two-thirds of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of such holders of the shares of that class as may be present at a general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.\n\n**_Amendment of Governing Documents._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation’s governing documents may be amended with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. As permitted by Cayman Islands law, our current memorandum and articles of association may only be amended with a special resolution of our shareholders.\n\n**_Rights of Non-resident or Foreign Shareholders._** There are no limitations imposed by our post-offering amended and restated memorandum and articles of association on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on our shares. In addition, there are no provisions in our current memorandum and articles of association governing the ownership threshold above which shareholder ownership must be disclosed.\n\n**_Cayman Islands Data Protection_**. We have certain duties under the Cayman Islands Data Protection Act, 2017 (“**DPA** ”) of the Cayman Islands based on internationally accepted principles of data privacy. \n\n**_Privacy Notice_**. The legal basis for this notification is to meet the standards required in respect of, and ensure compliance with, the requirements of DPA which came into effect in the Cayman Islands on 30 September 2019.\n\nThis privacy notice puts investors in the Company on notice that through your investment into the Company you may provide us with certain personal information which constitutes personal data within the meaning of the DPL (“personal data”). The Company collects, uses, discloses, retains and secures personal data to the extent reasonably required only and within the parameters that could be reasonably expected during the normal course of business. The Company will only process, disclose, transfer or retain personal data to the extent legitimately required to conduct the activities of the Company on an ongoing basis or to comply with legal and regulatory obligations to which the Company is subject. The Company will only transfer personal data in accordance with the requirements of the DPA, and will apply appropriate technical and organizational information security measures designed to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing of the personal data and against the accidental loss, destruction or damage to the personal data. In our use of this personal data, we will be characterized as a “data controller” for the purposes of the DPA, while our affiliates and service providers who may receive this personal data from us in the conduct of our activities may either act as our “data processors” for the purposes of the DPA or may process personal information for their own lawful purposes in connection with services provided to the Company.\n\nIf you are a natural person, this will affect you directly. If you are a corporate investor (including, for these purposes, legal arrangements such as trusts or exempted limited partnerships) that provides us with personal data on individuals connected to you for any reason in relation to your investment into the Company, this will be relevant for those individuals and you should inform such individuals of the content.\n\n**_What rights do individuals have in respect of personal data?_**\n\nUnder the DPA, individuals must be informed of the purposes for which their personal data is processed and this privacy notice fulfils the Company’s obligation in this respect. Individuals have rights under the DPA in certain circumstances.\n\nThese may include the right to request access to their personal data, the right to request rectification or correction of personal data, the right to request that processing of personal data be stopped or restricted and the right to require that the Company cease processing personal data for direct marketing purposes.\n\nIf you consider that your personal data has not been handled correctly, or you are not satisfied with the Company’s responses to any requests you have made regarding the use of your personal data, you have the right to complain to the Cayman Islands’ Ombudsman. The Ombudsman can be contacted by calling: +1 (345) 946-6283 or by email at info@ombudsman.ky.\n\n23\n\n**_Contacting the Company_**\n\nFor further information on the collection, use, disclosure, transfer or processing of your personal data or the exercise of any of the rights listed above, please contact us through the address and telephone number of our principal executive office. Our principal website is www.colorstarinternational.com. The information contained in, or accessible through, our website is not incorporated into this prospectus or the registration statement of which it forms a part.\n\n**Economic Substance**\n\nThe Cayman Islands has recently enacted the International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Act (2021 Revision), or the Cayman Economic Substance Act. The Company is required to comply with the Cayman Economic Substance Act. As the Company is a Cayman Islands company, compliance obligations include filing annual notifications for the Company, which need to state whether the Company is carrying out any relevant activities and if so, whether the Company has satisfied economic substance tests to the extent required under the Cayman Economic Substance Act. As it is a new regime, it is anticipated that the Cayman Economic Substance Act will evolve and be subject to further clarification and amendments. The Company may need to allocate additional resources to keep updated with these developments, and may have to make changes to our operations in order to comply with all requirements under the Cayman Economic Substance Act. Failure to satisfy these requirements may subject the Company to penalties under the Cayman Economic Substance Act.\n\n**_The Financial Action Task Force’s Increased Monitoring of the Cayman Islands_**\n\nIn February 2021, the Cayman Islands was added to the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) list of jurisdictions whose anti-money laundering practices are under increased monitoring, commonly referred to as the “FATF grey list.” When the FATF places a jurisdiction under increased monitoring, it means the country has committed to resolve swiftly the identified strategic deficiencies within agreed timeframes and is subject to increased monitoring during that timeframe. It is unclear how long this designation will remain in place and what ramifications, if any, the designation will have for the Company and its group.\n\n**_Certain Anti-Money Laundering Matters_**\n\nIn order to comply with legislation or regulations aimed at the prevention of money laundering, the Company may be required to adopt and maintain anti-money laundering procedures, and may require subscribers to provide evidence to verify their identity. Where permitted, and subject to certain conditions, the Company may also delegate the maintenance of our anti-money laundering procedures (including the acquisition of due diligence information) to a suitable person.\n\nThe Company reserves the right to request such information as is necessary to verify the identity of a subscriber. In the event of delay or failure on the part of the subscriber in producing any information required for verification purposes, we may refuse to accept the application, in which case any funds received will be returned without interest to the account from which they were originally debited.\n\nThe Company also reserves the right to refuse to make any redemption payment to a shareholder if directors or officers suspect or are advised that the payment of redemption proceeds to such shareholder might result in a breach of applicable anti-money laundering or other laws or regulations by any person in any relevant jurisdiction, or if such refusal is considered necessary or appropriate to ensure compliance with any such laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction.\n\nIf any person resident in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects or has reason for knowing or suspecting that another person is engaged in criminal conduct or is involved with terrorism or terrorist property and the information for that knowledge or suspicion came to their attention in the course of their business in the regulated sector, or other trade, profession, business or employment, the person will be required to report such knowledge or suspicion to (i) a nominated officer (appointed in accordance with the Proceeds of Crime Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands) or the Financial Reporting Authority of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act (As Revised), if the disclosure relates to criminal conduct or money laundering or (ii) to a police constable or a nominated officer (pursuant to the Terrorism Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands) or the Financial Reporting Authority, pursuant to the Terrorism Act (As Revised), if the disclosure relates to involvement with terrorism or terrorist financing and terrorist property. Such a report shall not be treated as a breach of confidence or of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed by any enactment or otherwise.\n\n24\n\n**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**\n\nThe Selling Shareholders and any of their respective pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their securities covered hereby on any trading market, stock exchange or other trading facility on which the securities are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. The Selling shareholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling securities:\n\n● | ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  \n---|---  \n● | block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the securities as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  \n● | purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;  \n● | an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;  \n● | privately negotiated transactions;  \n● | settlement of short sales;  \n● | in transactions through broker-dealers that agree with the Selling shareholders to sell a specified number of such securities at a stipulated price per security;  \n● | through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;  \n● | a combination of any such methods of sale; or  \n● | any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.  \n  \nThe Selling shareholders may also sell securities under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus.\n\nBroker-dealers engaged by the Selling shareholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling shareholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of securities, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with FINRA IM-2440.\n\nIn connection with the sale of the securities covered hereby, the Selling shareholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the securities in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The Selling shareholders may also sell securities short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the securities to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The Selling shareholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or create one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of securities offered by this prospectus, which securities such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction).\n\nThe Selling shareholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the securities may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the securities purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. We are requesting that each Selling Stockholder inform us that it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the securities. We will pay certain fees and expenses incurred by us incident to the registration of the securities.\n\n25\n\nBecause the Selling shareholders may be deemed to be an “underwriter” within the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act, including Rule 172 thereunder. In addition, any securities covered by this prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus. We are requesting that each Selling Stockholder confirm that there is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale securities by the Selling Stockholder.\n\nWe intend to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the securities may be resold by the Selling shareholders without registration and without regard to any volume or manner-of-sale limitations by reason of Rule 144, without the requirement for us to be in compliance with the current public information requirement under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the securities have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. The resale securities will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale securities covered hereby may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with.\n\nUnder applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale securities may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the Common Stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the Selling shareholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of the Common Stock by the Selling shareholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the Selling shareholders and are informing the Selling shareholders of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act).\n\n**Regulation M**\n\nThe anti-manipulation rules of Regulation M under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) may apply to sales of our ordinary shares and activities of the selling shareholder.\n\n26\n\n**MATERIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES APPLICABLE TO U.S. HOLDERS OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES**\n\nThe following sets forth the material Cayman Islands, Chinese and U.S. federal income tax consequences related to an investment in our ordinary shares. It is directed to U.S. Holders (as defined below) of our ordinary shares and is based upon laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this prospectus, all of which are subject to change. This description does not deal with all possible tax consequences relating to an investment in our ordinary shares, such as the tax consequences under state, local and other tax laws.\n\nThe following brief description applies only to U.S. Holders (defined below) that hold ordinary shares as capital assets and that have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. This brief description is based on the tax laws of the United States in effect as of the date of this prospectus and on U.S. Treasury regulations in effect or, in some cases, proposed, as of the date of this prospectus, as well as judicial and administrative interpretations thereof available on or before such date. All of the foregoing authorities are subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described below.\n\nThe brief description below of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to “U.S. Holders” will apply to you if you are a beneficial owner of shares and you are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,\n\n● | an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;  \n---|---  \n● | a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  \n---|---  \n● | an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or  \n---|---  \n● | a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more U.S. persons for all substantial decisions or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.  \n---|---  \n  \n**WE URGE POTENTIAL PURCHASERS OF OUR SHARES TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PURCHASING, OWNING AND DISPOSING OF OUR SHARES.**\n\n**Generally**\n\nColor Star Technology Co., Ltd. is an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands which is not currently subject to any Cayman Islands taxes. Color China is subject to Hong Kong law. CACM Group NY, Inc. and Baytao LLC are subject to U.S. laws.\n\n**Cayman Islands Taxation**\n\nThe Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to be material to us levied by the government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be applicable on instruments executed in, or after execution brought within the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is not party to any double tax treaties that are applicable to any payments made to or by our company. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands.\n\nPayments of dividends and capital in respect of the shares will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands and no withholding will be required on the payment of a dividend or capital to any holder of the shares, nor will gains derived from the disposal of the shares be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporation tax.\n\nNo stamp duty is payable in respect of the issue of the shares or on an instrument of transfer in respect of a share.\n\n27\n\n**United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**\n\nThe following discussion is a summary of U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares by a U.S. holder (as defined below) that holds our ordinary shares as “capital assets” (generally, property held for investment) under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). This discussion is based upon existing U.S. federal income tax law, which is subject to differing interpretations and may be changed, possibly with retroactive effect. No ruling has been sought from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any U.S. federal income tax consequences described below, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to particular investors in light of their individual circumstances, including investors subject to special tax rules (for example, banks or other financial institutions, insurance companies, broker-dealers, pension plans, cooperatives, traders in securities that have elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, partnerships and their partners, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, and tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations)), holders who are not U.S. holders, holders who own (directly, indirectly, or constructively) 10% or more of our voting stock, holders who will hold their ordinary shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale, or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or investors that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those summarized below. In addition, this discussion does not discuss any non-United States, alternative minimum tax, state, or local tax considerations, or the Medicare tax on net investment income. Each U.S. holder is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local, and non-United States income and other tax considerations with respect to the ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares.\n\n**_General_**\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created in, or organized under the laws of, the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust (A) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more U.S. persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (B) that has otherwise elected to be treated as a U.S. person under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations.\n\nIf a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding our ordinary shares and partners in such partnerships are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the particular United States federal income tax consequences of an investment in our ordinary shares.\n\n28\n\n**_Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations_**\n\nA non-U.S. corporation, such as our company, will be a “passive foreign investment company,” or “PFIC,” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if, in any particular taxable year, either (i) 75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of “passive” income or (ii) 50% or more of the average quarterly value of its assets (as determined on the basis of fair market value) during such year produce or are held for the production of passive income. For this purpose, cash is categorized as a passive asset and the company’s unbooked intangibles associated with active business activities may generally be classified as active assets. Passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and gains from the disposition of passive assets. We will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which we own, directly or indirectly, at least 25% (by value) of the stock.\n\nAlthough the law in this regard is unclear, we intend to treat CACM and Baytao as being owned by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and we treat it that way, not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of such entities but also because we are entitled to substantially all of their economic benefits, and, as a result, we consolidate their results of operations in our consolidated financial statements. Assuming that we are the owner of CACM and Baytao for United States federal income tax purposes, and based upon our income and assets and the value of our ordinary shares, we do not believe that we were a PFIC for the taxable years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and do not anticipate becoming a PFIC in the foreseeable future.\n\nAssuming that we are the owner of CACM and Baytao for U.S. federal income tax purposes, although we do not believe that we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and do not anticipate becoming a PFIC in the foreseeable future, the determination of whether we are or will become a PFIC will depend in part upon the value of our goodwill and other unrecorded intangibles (which will depend upon the market value of our ordinary shares from time-to-time, which may be volatile). In estimating the value of our goodwill and other unrecorded intangibles, we have taken into account our market capitalization. Among other matters, if our market capitalization is less than anticipated or subsequently declines, we may be or become a PFIC for the current or future taxable years. It is also possible that the IRS may challenge our classification or valuation of our goodwill and other unrecorded intangibles, which may result in our company being or becoming a PFIC for the current or one or more future taxable years.\n\nThe determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC will also depend, in part, on the composition of our income and assets, which may be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets and the cash raised in our initial public offering. If we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes or if we were treated as not owning CACM and Baytao for United States federal income tax purposes, our risk of being classified as a PFIC may substantially increase. Because our PFIC status for any taxable year is a factual determination that can be made only after the close of a taxable year, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for the current taxable year or any future taxable year. If we are a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. holder held our ordinary shares, we generally would continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. holder held our ordinary shares.\n\nThe discussion below under “Dividends” and “Sale or Other Disposition of ordinary shares” is written on the basis that we will not be or become a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The U.S. federal income tax rules that apply if we are a PFIC for the current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year are generally discussed below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules.”\n\n**_Dividends_**\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below, any cash distributions (including the amount of any tax withheld) paid on our ordinary shares out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, will generally be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder as dividend income on the day actually or constructively received by the U.S. holder. Because we do not intend to determine our earnings and profits on the basis of U.S. federal income tax principles, any distribution paid will generally be reported as a “dividend” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A non-corporate recipient of dividend income will generally be subject to tax on dividend income from a “qualified foreign corporation” at a reduced U.S. federal tax rate rather than the marginal tax rates generally applicable to ordinary income provided that certain holding period requirements are met.\n\n29\n\nA non-U.S. corporation (other than a corporation that is a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year) will generally be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation (a) if it is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the United States which the Secretary of Treasury of the United States determines is satisfactory for purposes of this provision and which includes an exchange of information program, or (b) with respect to any dividend it pays on stock which is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. In the event we are deemed to be a resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be eligible for the benefits of the United States-PRC income tax treaty (which the U.S. Treasury Department has determined is satisfactory for this purpose) and in that case we would be treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends paid on our ordinary shares. Each non-corporate U.S. holder is advised to consult its tax advisors regarding the availability of the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income for any dividends we pay with respect to our ordinary shares. Dividends received on the ordinary shares will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations.\n\nDividends will generally be treated as income from foreign sources for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes and will generally constitute passive category income. In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC “resident enterprise” under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, a U.S. holder may be subject to PRC withholding taxes on dividends paid on our ordinary shares. (See “—People’s Republic of China Taxation”) In that case, a U.S. holder may be eligible, subject to a number of complex limitations, to claim a foreign tax credit in respect of any foreign withholding taxes imposed on dividends received on ordinary shares. A U.S. holder who does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit for foreign tax withheld may instead claim a deduction, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in respect of such withholdings, but only for a year in which such U.S. holder elects to do so for all creditable foreign income taxes. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. U.S. holders are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances.\n\n**_Sale or Other Disposition of Ordinary Shares_**\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the disposition and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such ordinary shares. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term if the ordinary shares have been held for more than one year and will generally be United States source gain or loss for United States foreign tax credit purposes. Long-term capital gain of non-corporate U.S. holders is generally eligible for a reduced rate of taxation. The deductibility of a capital loss may be subject to limitations. In the event that we are treated as a PRC “resident enterprise” under the Enterprise Income Tax Law and gain from the disposition of the ordinary shares is subject to tax in the PRC, a U.S. holder that is eligible for the benefits of the income tax treaty between the United States and the PRC may elect to treat the gain as PRC source income. U.S. holders are advised to consult its tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a foreign tax is imposed on a disposition of our ordinary shares, including the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances and the election to treat any gain as PRC source.\n\n**_Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules_**\n\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder holds our ordinary shares, and unless the U.S. holder makes a mark-to-market election (as described below), the U.S. holder will generally be subject to special tax rules that have a penalizing effect, regardless of whether we remain a PFIC, for subsequent taxable years, on (i) any excess distribution that we make to the U.S. holder (which generally means any distribution paid during a taxable year to a U.S. holder that is greater than 125% of the average annual distributions paid in the three preceding taxable years or, if shorter, the U.S. holder’s holding period for the ordinary shares), and (ii) any gain realized on the sale or other disposition, including, under certain circumstances, a pledge, of ordinary shares. Under the PFIC rules:\n\n● | such excess distribution and/or gain will be allocated ratably over the U.S. holder’s holding period for the ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n● | such amount allocated to the current taxable year and any taxable years in the U.S. holder’s holding period prior to the first taxable year in which we are a PFIC, or pre-PFIC year, will be taxable as ordinary income;  \n---|---  \n● | such amount allocated to each prior taxable year, other than a pre-PFIC year, will be subject to tax at the highest tax rate in effect for that year; and  \n---|---  \n● | an interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the tax attributable to each prior taxable year, other than a pre-PFIC year.  \n---|---  \n  \n30\n\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder holds our ordinary shares and any of our non-United States subsidiaries is also a PFIC, such U.S. holder would be treated as owning a proportionate amount (by value) of the shares of the lower-tier PFIC for purposes of the application of these rules. U.S. holders are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to any of our subsidiaries.\n\nAs an alternative to the foregoing rules, a U.S. holder of “marketable stock” in a PFIC may make a mark-to-market election. Since we plan to have our ordinary shares listed on the Nasdaq, and provided that the ordinary shares will be regularly traded on the Nasdaq, a U.S. holder holds ordinary shares will be eligible to make a mark-to-market election if we are or were to become a PFIC. If a mark-to-market election is made, the U.S. holder will generally (i) include as ordinary income for each taxable year that we are a PFIC the excess, if any, of the fair market value of ordinary shares held at the end of the taxable year over the adjusted tax basis of such ordinary shares and (ii) deduct as an ordinary loss the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of the ordinary shares over the fair market value of such ordinary shares held at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. The U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the ordinary shares would be adjusted to reflect any income or loss resulting from the mark-to-market election. If a U.S. holder makes an effective mark-to-market election, in each year that we are a PFIC any gain recognized upon the sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares will be treated as ordinary income and loss will be treated as ordinary loss, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. If a U.S. holder makes a mark-to-market election it will be effective for the taxable year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years unless the ordinary shares are no longer regularly traded on a qualified exchange or the Internal Revenue Service consents to the revocation of the election.\n\nIf a U.S. holder makes a mark-to-market election in respect of a PFIC and such corporation ceases to be a PFIC, the U.S. holder will not be required to take into account the mark-to-market gain or loss described above during any period that such corporation is not a PFIC.\n\nBecause a mark-to-market election cannot be made for any lower-tier PFICs that a PFIC may own, a U.S. holder who makes a mark-to-market election with respect to our ordinary shares may continue to be subject to the general PFIC rules with respect to such U.S. holder’s indirect interest in any of our non-United States subsidiaries if any of them is a PFIC.\n\nWe do not intend to provide information necessary for U.S. holders to make qualified electing fund elections, which, if available, would result in tax treatment different from the general tax treatment for PFICs described above.\n\nAs discussed above under “Dividends,” dividends that we pay on our ordinary shares will not be eligible for the reduced tax rate that applies to qualified dividend income if we are a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year. In addition, if a U.S. holder owns our ordinary shares during any taxable year that we are a PFIC, such holder would generally be required to file an annual IRS Form 8621. Each U.S. holder is advised to consult its tax advisors regarding the potential tax consequences to such holder if we are or become a PFIC, including the possibility of making a mark-to-market election.\n\n**_Information Reporting_**\n\nCertain U.S. holders may be required to report information to the IRS relating to an interest in “specified foreign financial assets,” including shares issued by a non-United States corporation, for any year in which the aggregate value of all specified foreign financial assets exceeds US$50,000 (or a higher dollar amount prescribed by the IRS), subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for shares held in custodial accounts maintained with a United States financial institution). These rules also impose penalties if a U.S. holder is required to submit such information to the IRS and fails to do so.\n\nIn addition, U.S. holders may be subject to information reporting to the IRS with respect to dividends on and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares. Each U.S. holder is advised to consult with its tax advisor regarding the application of the United States information reporting rules to their particular circumstances.\n\n31\n\n**LEGAL MATTERS**\n\nThe legality and validity of the securities offered from time to time under this prospectus was passed upon Conyers Dill & Pearman to the extent governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands, who are acting as counsel to our company with respect to matters of Cayman Islands law. Ortoli Rosenstadt LLP is acting as counsel to our company regarding U.S. securities law matters. \n\nThe current address of Conyers Dill & Pearman is Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, PO Box 2681, Grand Cayman KY1-1111, Cayman Islands. The current address of Ortoli Rosenstadt LLP is 366 Madison Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York, NY 10017.\n\n32\n\n**EXPERTS**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 2019 and 2018 as set forth and incorporated by reference in this prospectus and elsewhere in the registration statement have been so included in reliance on the report of Wei, Wei & Co., LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm given on their authority as experts in accounting and auditing. The current address of Wei, Wei & Co., LLP is 133-10 39th Avenue, Flushing, NY 11354.\n\n33\n\n**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**\n\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability. We incorporated in the Cayman Islands because of certain benefits associated with being a Cayman Islands exempted company, such as political and economic stability, an effective judicial system, a favorable tax system, the absence of foreign exchange control or currency restrictions and the availability of professional and support services. However, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of securities laws that provide significantly less protection to investors as compared to the securities laws of the United States. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the United States.\n\nAll of our assets are located in China. In addition, some of our directors and officers are residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our directors and officers, or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\n\nAccording to Conyers Dill & Pearman, our local Cayman Islands’ counsel, there is uncertainty with regard to Cayman Islands law relating to whether a judgment obtained from the United States or Hong Kong courts under civil liability provisions of the securities laws will be determined by the courts of the Cayman Islands as penal or punitive in nature. If such a determination is made, the courts of the Cayman Islands will not recognize or enforce the judgment against a Cayman Islands’ company. The courts of the Cayman Islands in the past determined that disgorgement proceedings brought at the instance of the Securities and Exchange Commission are penal or punitive in nature and such judgments would not be enforceable in the Cayman Islands. Other civil liability provisions of the securities laws may be characterized as remedial, and therefore enforceable but the Cayman Islands’ Courts have not yet ruled in this regard. Our Cayman Islands’ counsel has further advised us that a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of the United States under which a sum of money is payable other than a sum payable in respect of taxes, fines, penalties or similar charges, may be subject to enforcement proceedings as a debt in the courts of the Cayman Islands.\n\nAs of the date hereof, no treaty or other form of reciprocity exists between the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong governing the recognition and enforcement of judgments.\n\nCayman Islands’ counsel further advised that although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States or Hong Kong, a judgment obtained in such jurisdictions will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment (1) is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction, (2) imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given, (3) is final, (4) is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty, and (5) was not obtained in a manner and is of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands.\n\n34\n\n**INFORMATION INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE**\n\nWe “incorporate by reference” certain documents we have filed with the SEC, which means that we are disclosing important information to you by referring you to those documents.

As a “foreign private issuer”, we are exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act prescribing certain disclosure and procedural requirements for proxy solicitations, and our officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and “short-swing” profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act, with respect to their purchases and sales of shares. In addition, we are not required to file annual, quarterly and current reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as United States companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. However, we anticipate filing with the SEC, within four months after the end of each fiscal year, an annual report on Form 20-F containing financial statements audited by an independent registered public accounting firm. We also anticipate furnishing semi-annual reports on Form 6-K containing unaudited interim financial information for the first two quarters of each fiscal year, within 6 months after the end of such quarter.\n\nThis prospectus does not contain all of the information set forth in the registration statement and the exhibits to the registration statement. For further information with respect to us and the securities the Selling shareholders are offering under this prospectus, we refer you to the registration statement and the exhibits and schedules filed as a part of the registration statement. You may read and copy the registration statement, as well as our reports, proxy statements and other information, at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.

Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n**OUR BUSINESS**\n\n**History and Development of the Company**\n\nWe are an entertainment and education company which provides online entertainment performances and online music education services via our wholly-owned subsidiary, Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”), education service carried out via our wholly-owned subsidiary CACM Group NY, Inc. (“CACM”) and our joint venture entity, Baytao LLC.\n\nColor Star Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.) was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C-corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, we changed our name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc.\n\nOn August 20, 2018, CACM Group NY, Inc. (“CACM”) was incorporated in the State of New York and is wholly owned by us. The establishment of CACM was to expand the Company’s business in the U.S. CACM has not commenced operations. \n\nOn December 27, 2018, we consummated a re-domicile merger pursuant to which we merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Cayman Islands company and the surviving entity in the merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger adopted in July 2018. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company is now governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nOn July 16, 2019, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of the Company’s memorandum and articles of association which was approved by the Company’s shareholders, the Company’s name was changed from China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. to Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.\n\n2\n\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”) and its shareholders. On February 14, 2020, the Company consummated the acquisition of Sunway Kids whereby we issued 1,989,262 ordinary shares and $2 million of cash to be paid in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sunway Kids. The $2 million cash consideration is payable in five installments over five years according to an earn-out schedule. Sunway Kids thereby became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Sunway Kids was established on February 29, 2012, under the laws of the British Virgin Islands as an offshore holding company. On August 23, 2018, Sunway Kids established its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brave Millenium Limited (“Brave Millenium”) under the laws of Hong Kong. On December 4, 2019, Brave Millenium established Chengdu Hengshanghui Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. (“Chengdu Hengshanghui”) in China as a wholly foreign owned limited liability company (the “WFOE”). On December 9, 2019, Chengdu Hengshanghui entered into a series of variable interest entity agreements with Chengdu Hengshanghui Education Consulting Co., Ltd. (“Hengshanghui Education”). Through Sunway Kids and its variable interest entity Hengshanghui Education, we were engaged in providing education and health services to day-care and preschools in China.\n\nOn March 10, 2020, CACM entered into a certain joint venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Baydolphin, Inc., a company organized under the laws of New York (“Baydolphin”). Pursuant to the JV Agreement, CACM and Baydolphin have established a limited liability company under the laws of New York, Baytao LLC (“Baytao”), which will intended to be the 100% owner of one or more operating entities in the U.S. to engage in the business of online and offline after-school education.\n\nPrior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, our core business has been the concrete business in China. Our concrete business was negatively affected by the economic cycle and government policies. The concrete industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The entire concrete industry in the PRC’s Beijing area experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years as the Beijing government continues to enforce concrete production reformation and tightened environmental laws from late 2017 to date. The reformation has caused great uncertainties for local enterprises in the construction market. Since 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down. Also, the Beijing government ordered the suspension of construction jobsites during winters to reduce air pollution since 2017. The operations of Xin Ao were also severely affected. As a result of the Company’s deteriorating cash position, we defaulted on bank loans and experienced a substantial increase in contingent liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, there was a default on a bank loan of $24,345,129. As of December 31, 2019, Xin Ao is subject to several civil lawsuits for which the Company estimated that it is more than likely to pay judgments in the amount of approximately $6.8 million (including interest and penalties of $1.6 million). During the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were additional estimated claims of approximately $0.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The Company believed it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to turn around the concrete business. As such, the Company had been actively seeking to dispose of the concrete business after the acquisition of Sunway Kids.\n\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company completed the disposition (the “Xin Ao Disposition”) of Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (“BVI-ACM”), after obtaining its shareholders’ approval on April 27, 2020 and satisfaction or waiver of all other closing conditions. Upon the closing of the Xin Ao Disposition, Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He became the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The proceeds of $600,000 from the Xin Ao Disposition have been used for the Company’s working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nOn April 27, 2020, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of its memorandum and articles of association (which was approved by the Company’s shareholders), the Company’s name was changed to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”), a Hong Kong limited company, and shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company shall acquire all of the outstanding issued shares and other equity interests in Color China from the sellers (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Color China, the Company shall issue 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company and pay an aggregate of $2,000,000 to the sellers. The Company plans to make Color China an emerging online performance and online music education provider with a significant collection of performance specific assets -- leveraging professional experience of the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) who has established good relationships with major record companies, renowned artists and entertainment agencies around the world. Immediately after the Acquisition, Color Star will own 100% of Color China. On June 3, 2020, the transaction contemplated by the Exchange Agreement was consummated when the Company issued 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company to the Sellers and the Sellers transferred all of Color China’s issued and outstanding shares to the Company.\n\n3\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the Company and the former shareholders of Sunway Kids entered into an Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment”) to the Share Exchange Agreement dated December 31, 2019, as amended. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company shall not make any Earn-out Payment to the former shareholders of Sunway Kids since Sunway Kids has been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and management of Sunway Kids believes it will be very difficult to achieve its projected financial results. On the same day, Sunway Kids and Yanliang Han (the “Purchaser”), an unrelated third party, entered into certain share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the Purchaser agreed to purchase Sunway Kids for cash consideration of $2.4 million consisting of $400,000 which shall be paid within a month of closing, and $2,000,000 to be paid in monthly installments of $200,000 over 10 months. Upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Disposition SPA on June 25, 2020, the Purchaser became the sole shareholder of Sunway Kids and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by Sunway Kids.\n\nEffective October 1, 2020, the Company changed the ticker symbol of its ordinary shares traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market from “HHT” to “CSCW,” representing the abbreviation of “Color Star Color World.” This is the new focus of the Company’s business.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nWe are an entertainment and education company providing online and offline innovative music education through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Color China and CACM. We strive to offer students professional artist training platform featured by exclusive content and live interaction, with the mission of delivering world-class entertainment learning experiences and promoting entertainment exchange between U.S. and China with our strong resources and deep connections in industry. We launched our online platform Color World on September 10, 2020, and it is currently operating in China. The curriculum development created by us includes music, sports, animation, painting and calligraphy, film and television, life skills, etc., covering plenty of aspects of entertainment, sports and culture. At present, we have signed contracts with well-known international artists and more than 50 celebrity teachers have been retained to launch online lectures. The Color World platform not only has celebrity lectures, but also celebrity concert videos, celebrity peripheral products, such as celebrity branded merchandise, and artist interactive communication. We strive to build an all-star cultural and entertainment industry chain. To establish a new entertainment industry chain combining online and offline, we also plan to establish offline education institutions. The offline education base will train during the day and perform at night to make the training base a commercial operation. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our plan to establish the offline education base has been delayed. The management of the Company will adjust our plan of development in accordance with the development of COVID-19.\n\nThe management believes that we, along with our alliance, have strong industry resources and influence to become a comprehensive online academy for global “future stars”. The Company was formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd., and changed its name to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd. in May 2020. Prior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, the Company’s core business had been focusing on the concrete business in China.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates our current corporate structure:\n\n![](image_005.jpg)\n\n**_Corporate Information_**\n\nOur principal executive office is located at 800 3rd Ave, Suite 2800, New York, NY 10022. Our telephone number is +1 (212) 220-3967. We maintain a website at https://colorstarinternational.com/ that contains information about our Company, though no information contained on our website is part of this prospectus.\n\n4\n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth under “Risk Factors” described in our most recent annual report on Form 20-F, filed on November 13, 2020 and amended on February 26, 2021, as supplemented and updated by subsequent current reports on Form 6-K that we have filed with the SEC, together with all other information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement and in any related free writing prospectus in connection with a specific offering, before making an investment decision. Each of the risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects, as well as the value of an investment in our securities, and the occurrence of any of these risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\n\nIn addition to the risk factors referenced above, as described in our most recent annual report on Form 20-F, we want to disclose the additional risk factors below.\n\n**Risks Related to Our Business and Industry**\n\n**_We have a limited operating history with our current business model, which makes it difficult to predict our prospects and our business and financial performance._**\n\nWe have a short operating history with our current business model focusing on providing online entertainment performances and online music education services. We transitioned from a concrete business company to our current business model in 2020. Our limited history of operating under the current business model may not serve as an adequate basis for evaluating our prospect and operating results, including gross billings, net revenues, cash flows and operating margins. We have encountered, and may continue to encounter in the future, risks, challenges and uncertainties associated with operating an internet-based education business and online video streaming service industry, such as building and managing reliable and secure IT systems and infrastructure, addressing regulatory compliance and uncertainty, engaging, training and retaining high quality employees such as our teaching staff and IT support staff, and improving and expanding our education content offering. If we do not manage these risks successfully, our operating and financial results may differ materially from our expectations and our business and financial performance may suffer.\n\n**_We may require additional capital, including to fund potential acquisitions and capital expenditures, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all and which depends on many factors beyond our control._**\n\nTo support our growing business, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our platform and product offerings. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our ordinary shares, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates, require additional restrictive financial and operational covenants, or require us to incur significant transaction fees, issue warrants or other equity securities, or issue convertible securities. These restrictions and covenants may restrict our ability to finance our operations and engage in, expand, or otherwise pursue our business activities and strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, and breaches of these covenants and restrictions could result in a default and an acceleration of our obligations under a debt agreement. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or our solutions under development, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.\n\nWe evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing and to an extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n5\n\n**_Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19._**\n\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus causing respiratory illness, or COVID-19, has surfaced in Wuhan, China, spreading at a fast rate in January and February of 2020, and has now developed to be a global pandemic. In reaction to this outbreak, an increasing number of countries imposed travel suspensions to and from China following the World Health Organization’s “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) announcement on January 30, 2020. Since this outbreak, business activities in China and many other countries including U.S. have been disrupted by a series of emergency quarantine measures taken by the government.\n\nAs a result, our operations in China and U.S. have been materially affected. New York, where our U.S. operations are based, is currently significantly affected by COVID-19, which led to measures taken by the New York government trying to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as reduction on the number of people in gathering and travel restrictions. Additional travel and other restrictions may be put in place to further control the outbreak in U.S. Accordingly, our operation and business have been and will continue to be adversely affected as the results of the wide-spread pandemic. Management may have to adjust or change our business plan in response to the prolonged pandemic and change of social behavior.\n\nThe extent to which COVID-19 negatively impacts our business is highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We believe that the coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to control it may have a significant negative impact on not only our business, but economic activities globally. The magnitude of this negative effect on the continuity of our business operation in China and U.S. remains uncertain. These uncertainties impede our ability to conduct our daily operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result affect our stock price and create more volatility.\n\n**_We may not be able to oversee the new joint venture efficiently._**\n\nWe may not be able to oversee Baytao, our new joint venture, efficiently, realize anticipated profits or effectively implement our growth and operating strategies. We will need to transition from a company with our primary operations in China to a company capable of supporting operations in both China and the United States. We might not be successful in such a transition. There can be no guarantee that the addition of the new joint venture will not cause us to incur additional debt and increase our exposure to market and other risks. Our failure to successfully pursue our strategies or effectively operate the joint venture entity could also have a material adverse effect on our rate of growth and operating performance.\n\n**_If we are unable to operate the “Color World” platform as planned, our results of operation will be significantly impacted._**\n\nWe launched the “Color World” platform on October 15, 2020. The attractiveness of our platform to our prospective “Star Teachers” and student subscribers depends on our ability to innovate. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and expand our platform and education services. We must also continue to enhance and improve our technology infrastructure. These efforts may require us to develop or license increasingly complex technologies. In addition, new education services and technologies developed and introduced by competitors could render our education services and technologies obsolete if we are unable to update or modify our own technology. Developing and integrating new education services and technologies into our existing platform and infrastructure could be expensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, any new features and functions may not achieve market acceptance. We may not succeed in implementing new technologies, or may incur substantial costs in doing so. Our platform and education services must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order for us to recoup our investments. Our platform and education services could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:\n\n● | we may fail to predict market demand accurately and to provide education services that meet this demand in a timely fashion;  \n---|---  \n● | our marketing efforts may be inefficient and fail to attract the potential users;  \n---|---  \n● | Star Teachers that we recruit on our platforms may not like, find useful or agree with any changes;  \n---|---  \n● | there may be defects, errors or failures on our platform;  \n---|---  \n● | there may be negative publicity about our platforms’ performance or effectiveness; and  \n---|---  \n● | there may be competing services or technologies introduced or anticipated to be introduced by our competitors.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf our platform and education services or technologies do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n6\n\n**_Our success relies on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and qualified key personnel, and our business may be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate them._**\n\nOur business operations depend on the continued services of our senior management team and qualified key personnel, particularly our executive officers and the senior management of Color China, our wholly owned subsidiary.\n\nAlthough we have provided different incentives to our senior management team, we cannot assure you that we can continue to retain their services. One or more of our key executives may be unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions. Meanwhile, we have also provided attractive compensation packages to our qualified key personnel. However, we may not be able to hire and retain these personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Some of the companies with which we compete for qualified and skilled personnel have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. In addition, we invest significant time and resources in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them.\n\nIf we are unable to retain the services of our senior management team or qualified key personnel, we may not be able to find suitable replacements or may incur significant expenses in finding such replacements, thus our future growth may be constrained, our business may be severely disrupted and our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, although we have entered into confidentiality and non-competition agreements with our senior management team and qualified key personnel, there is no assurance that any member of our senior management team or any of our qualified key personnel will not join a competitor. In the event that any dispute arises between us, on one hand, and any of our senior management and qualified key personnel, on the other hand, we may have to incur substantial costs and expenses in order to enforce such agreements, or we may be unable to enforce them at all.\n\n**_If we are unable to recruit “Star Teachers” as planned or if these instructors do not perform according to the agreements we have with them, the operation of our performance support and music education business will be negatively impacted._**\n\nProfessional artists and producers that we have begun recruiting as our Star Teachers help us build and maintain the quality of our education and services, as well as our brand and reputation. Our ability to continue to attract recruit the instructors with the necessary experience and qualifications is a key factor in the success of our operations. We seek to continue hiring experienced and successful professionals in music, film, sports, animation, television, presentations, dance, art and other entertainment industries whom are able to follow our education service protocols and deliver effective instructions based on the agreements we have with them. The market for the recruitment of these professionals is competitive, and we must also provide continued training to ensure that our instructors stay abreast of changes in student demands, teaching methodologies and other necessary changes.\n\nIn order to recruit these industry professionals as instructors on our platform, we must provide candidates with competitive compensation packages. Although we have not experienced major difficulties in recruiting or training qualified instructors thus far, we cannot guarantee we will be able to continue to recruit, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified instructors in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n7\n\n**_If we are unable to reach a critical mass of subscribers, our revenues may not be sufficient to cover the costs of our recruitment of Star Teachers._**\n\nWe are obligated to pay each of our Star Teachers on a case-by-case basis depending on the results of our negotiations. Some Star Teachers will accept fixed payments following a predefined schedule, whereas others may instead request a revenue sharing payment model whereby we will need to distribute to the Star Teachers a percentage of the net income earned from generated sales, licensing or other revenue from their courses on our platform, including a pro rata share of our subscription fees, or a hybrid of the two. If we are unable to generate enough revenue from our subscription fees from our users to cover our Star Teachers’ recruitment costs, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n**_Our education service revenue model depends on developing a subscriber base of users. If we fail to reach a critical mass of subscribers, our net revenues may not be sufficient, and we may not be able to implement our business plan._**\n\nWe expect to generate revenue primarily from the fees we collect from our users. It is critical for us to enroll subscribers in a cost-effective manner. Some of the factors, many of which are largely beyond our control, could prevent us from successfully increasing subscriptions in a cost-effective manner, or at all. These factors include, among other things, (i) reduced interest in the products and services we offer; (ii) negative publicity or perceptions regarding us, or electronic education services in general; (iii) the emergence of alternative technologies not offered by us; (iv) the inability of subscribers to pay the fees; (v) increasing market competition, particularly price reductions by competitors that we are unable or unwilling to match; and (vi) adverse changes in relevant government policies or general economic conditions. If one or more of these factors reduce market demand for our services, our subscriber base may not materialize as anticipated or our costs associated with subscriber acquisition and retention could increase, or both, any of which could materially affect our ability to grow our gross billings and net revenues. These developments could also harm our brand and reputation, which would negatively impact our ability to establish or expand our business.\n\n**_We expect to rely heavily on information and technology to operate our existing and future education products and services, and any cybersecurity incident or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could result in the loss of critical confidential information or adversely impact our reputation, business or results of operations._**\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and to compete effectively depends in part upon the satisfactory performance and reliability of our technology network, including the ability to provide features of services that are important to our customers and to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers. We also rely on our technology to maintain and process various operating and financial data that are essential to the day-to-day operation of our business and formulation of our development strategies. Our business operations and growth prospects depend on our ability to maintain and make timely and cost-effective enhancements and upgrades to our technology system and to introduce innovative additions that can meet changing operational needs in future. Therefore, we expect to continue to invest in advanced information technology and any equipment to enhance operational efficiency and reliability as we grow. Accordingly, any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our IT infrastructure could damage our reputation, decrease user satisfaction and retention, adversely impact our ability to attract new users and expand our service and product offerings, and materially disrupt our operations. If any of these occur, our business operations, reputation and prospects could be harmed.\n\n**_If our security measures are breached or fail and result in unauthorized disclosure of data by our employees or our third-party agents, we could lose existing subscribers, fail to attract new subscribers and be exposed to protracted and costly litigation._**\n\nMaintaining platform security is of critical importance to our subscribers because the platform stores and transmits proprietary and confidential information, which may include sensitive personally identifiable information that may be subject to stringent legal and regulatory obligations. As an electronic education service provider, we face an increasing number of threats to our IT infrastructure, including unauthorized activity and access by our employees or third-party agents, system viruses, worms, malicious code and organized cyber-attacks, which could breach our security and disrupt our business. We hope to introduce data security and confidentiality protocols into the cooperation agreements we enter into with third-party sales agents with whom we share prospective subscribers’ contact information. As we expand, we hope to invest in improving our technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans to prevent unauthorized access of confidential or sensitive personal information by our employees and third-party sales agents in the process of engaging prospective subscribers.\n\n8\n\nThese measures, however, may not be as effective as we anticipate. In addition, there is no assurance that our third-party sales agents will comply with contractual and legal requirements with respect to data privacy when they collect data from our prospective customers. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, we could be subject to liability or our business could be interrupted, potentially over an extended period of time. Any or all of these issues could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to attract and enroll prospective subscribers, cause prospective subscribers not to enroll or stay enrolled, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability. Further, any reputational damage resulting from breach of our security measures could create distrust of our company by prospective subscribers or investors. We may be required to expend significant management time and additional resources to protect against the threat of these disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such disruptions or breaches.\n\n**_Privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our user data and disclosure of user data could adversely impact our business and reputation._**\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business and in particular in connection with conducting sales and marketing activities with our existing and prospective subscribers as well as the utilization of our AI-powered platform programs, we collect and utilize data supplied by our users. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our users in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results.\n\nInternationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\n**_We face regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to the licensing requirement for the online transmission of internet audio-visual programs in China._**\n\nOn December 20, 2007, the National Radio and Television Administration f/k/a known as the State Administration of Press Publication Radio Film and Television, or SAPPRFT, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, jointly promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Internet Audio Visual Program Services, or the Audio Visual Program Provisions, which became effective on January 31, 2008 and were amended on August 28, 2015. Among other things, the Audio Visual Program Provisions stipulate that no entities or individuals may provide Internet audio-visual program services without a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs issued by SAPPRFT or completing the relevant filing with SAPPRFT or its local bureaus, and only state-owned or state-controlled entities are eligible to apply for a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs. On April 1, 2010, SAPPRFT promulgated the Provisional Implementations of Tentative Categories of Internet Audio Visual Program Services, or the Categories, which clarified the scope of Internet audio-visual programs services, which was amended on March 10, 2017. According to the Categories, there are four categories of Internet audio-visual program services which are further divided into seventeen sub-categories. Sub-category No. 3 to the second category covers the making and editing of certain specialized audio-visual programs concerning, among other things, educational content, and broadcasting such content to the general public online. Sub-category No. 5 of the first category and sub-category No. 7 of the second category cover the live broadcasting of important political, martial, economic, social, cultural, sports activities or events or general social or community cultural activities, sports games and other organized activities. However, there are still significant uncertainties relating to the interpretation and implementation of the Audio Visual Program Provisions, in particular, the scope of “internet audio-visual programs.” See “Regulations Relating to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs.”\n\n9\n\nWe plan to deliver our courses in live streaming format worldwide. Our teachers and students communicate and interact live with each other via our virtual learning community. The audio and video data will likely be transmitted through the platforms between specific recipients instantly without any further redaction. We believe the nature of the raw data we transmit will distinguish us from general providers of internet audio-visual program services, such as the operator of online video websites, and the provision of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions are not applicable with regard to our offering of the courses. However, we cannot assure you that the competent PRC government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to our opinion. In addition, we also plan to offer video recordings of live streaming courses and certain other audio-video contents on our electronic platforms to our students as supplementary course materials on our platforms. If the government authorities determine that our offering of the courses fall within the relevant category of Internet audio-visual program services under the Categories, we may be required to obtain the License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs.\n\nThe Categories describe “Internet audio-visual program services” in a very broad, vague manner and are unclear as to whether electronic courses, whether delivered in a live streaming format or through video recordings, fall into the definition of audio-visual programs. We have made inquiries to the relevant bureaus of SAPPRFT and were informed that online educational content provided through live streaming or recorded courses does not fall within the scope of internet audio-visual programs, the transmission of which does not require a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs. We cannot assure you that the PRC government will not ultimately take a view that live streaming or recorded courses or any other content offered on our platforms are subject to the Audio Visual Program Provisions. We currently do not hold a license for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs, and since we are not a state-owned or state-controlled entity, we are not eligible to apply for such license. If the PRC government determines that our content should be considered as “internet audio- visual programs” for the purpose of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, we may be required to obtain a license for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs. We are, however, not eligible apply for such license since we are not a state-owned or state-controlled entity. If this were to occur, we may be subject to penalties, fines, legal sanctions or an order to suspend the provision of our live streaming courses. As of the date of this annual report, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities regarding the lack of a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs in conducting of our business.\n\n**_Our failure to obtain and maintain approvals, licenses or permits in China applicable to our business could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations in the future._**\n\nAs we plan to deliver our courses in live streaming format worldwide, including in China, we may be subject to various regulations by a number of PRC regulatory authorities, such as the SAIC, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the MITT, the National Radio and Television Administration, and the State Council Information Office, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Welfare. We may be required in the future to obtain additional government approvals, licenses and permits in connection with our operations.\n\nBy way of example, depending upon regulatory interpretation, under the current PRC laws and regulations, the provision of our educational content through our electronic platform may be considered “online publishing” and may require us to obtain an Internet Publishing License, which we currently do not have.\n\nAs of the date of this report, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities regarding the lack of any the above-mentioned approvals, licenses or permits. However, we cannot guarantee that the government authorities will not impose any penalties or sanctions on us in the future, which may include warnings, fines, mandates to remedy any violations, confiscation of the gains derived from the services for which approvals, licenses or permits are required, and/or an order to cease to provide such services. In addition, we cannot guarantee that the government will not promulgate new laws and regulations that require additional licenses, permits and/or approvals for the operation of any of our existing or future business. If we are unable to obtain such licenses, permits, or approvals in a timely fashion, we could be subject to penalties and operational disruption and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n10\n\n**_We face intense competition which could adversely affect our results of operations and market share._**\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is sensitive to price, content (_i.e._ , curriculum) and quality of service. Some of our competitors may have more financial resources, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do, or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to obtain or raise capital and enter into strategic relationships more easily. We also compete with leading domestic supplier companies based on a number of factors including business model, operational capabilities, cost control and service quality, as well as in-house delivery capabilities to serve their logistics needs and compete with us.\n\nWe are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that affect many other businesses, including but not limited to:\n\n(1) | Increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare benefits;  \n---|---  \n(2) | The increasing costs of compliance with federal, state and foreign governmental agency mandates;  \n---|---  \n(3) | Any impacts on our business resulting from new domestic and international government laws and regulation;  \n---|---  \n(4) | Market conditions in the childhood education industry or the economy as a whole;  \n---|---  \n(5) | Market acceptance of our new service and growth initiatives;  \n---|---  \n(6) | Announcements of the introduction of new products and services by our competitors;  \n---|---  \n(7) | The impact of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our products and services;  \n---|---  \n(8) | Developments concerning current or future strategic collaborations; and  \n---|---  \n(9) | Widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis such as we are currently experiencing with the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf we are unable to respond to these changing market conditions, our business and financial results may be materially affected.\n\n**_We may be unable to fund any significant up-front and/or guaranteed payment cash requirements associated with our live music streaming rights, which could result in the inability to secure and retain such streaming rights and may limit our operating flexibility, which may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition._**\n\nIn order to secure event and festival live music streaming rights or hold concerts, we may be required to fund significant up-front and/or guaranteed payment cash requirements to artists or festival or event promoters prior to the event or festival taking place. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand or available capacity to advance the necessary cash for any given artist, event or festival, we would not be able to retain the rights for that artist, festival or event, such counter parties may be able to terminate their content acquisition agreements with us, and as a result our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\n**_We may be unsuccessful in developing our original content._**\n\nWe plan to continue to produce original classes, covering various areas such as singing and dancing, etc. We believe that a positive reputation with users concerning our original content is important in attracting and retaining users. To the extent our content is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to users, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. If the original content we produce does not attract new users, we may not be able to cover our expenses to produce such programs, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\n11\n\nAs we continue to develop our original content, we will become responsible for higher production costs and other expenses. We may also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. To the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\n**_We face competition for users’ attention and time._**\n\nThe market for entertainment video content is intensively competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as (i) interactive on-demand audio content and pre-recorded entertainment, (ii) broadcast radio providers, including terrestrial and Internet radio providers, (iii) cable, satellite and Internet television and movie content providers, (iv) video gaming providers and (v) other sources of entertainment for our users’ attention and time. These content and service providers pose a competitive threat to the extent existing or potential users choose to consume their content or use their services rather than our content or our services. The online marketplace for live music and music-related content may rapidly evolve and provide users with a number of alternatives or new access models, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n**_Our services and software are highly technical and may contain undetected software bugs or vulnerabilities, which could manifest in ways that could seriously harm our reputation and our business._**\n\nOur services and software are highly technical and complex. Our services or any other products we may introduce in the future, may contain undetected software bugs, hardware errors, and other vulnerabilities. These bugs and errors can manifest in any number of ways in our products, including through diminished performance, security vulnerabilities, malfunctions, or even permanently disabled products. We have a practice of regularly updating our products and some errors in our products may be discovered only after a product has been used by users, and may in some cases be detected only under certain circumstances or after extended use. Any errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities discovered in our code or backend after release could damage our reputation, drive away users, allow third parties to manipulate or exploit our software (including, for example, providing mobile device users a means to suppress advertisements without payment and gain access to features only available to the ad-supported service), lower revenue and expose us to claims for damages, any of which could seriously harm our business. Additionally, errors, bugs, or other vulnerabilities may—either directly or if exploited by third parties—affect our ability to make accurate royalty payments.\n\nWe also could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention and seriously harm our reputation and our business. In addition, if our liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be seriously harmed.\n\n**_Our business depends on a strong developing brand, and any failure to create, maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to attract and/ or expand our base of users._**\n\nMaintaining, protecting and enhancing our brand is critical to expanding our base of users and star teachers, and will depend largely on our ability to continue to develop and provide an innovative and high-quality experience for our users and to attract more celebrities to work with us, which we may not do successfully. Our brands may be impaired by a number of other factors, including any failure to keep pace with technological advances on our platform or with our services, slower load times for our services, a decline in the quality or quantity of the content available on our services, a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or any alleged violations of law, regulations, or public policy. If we do not successfully maintain a strong brand, our business could be harmed.\n\n12\n\n**_We are at risk of attempts at unauthorized access to our services, and failure to effectively prevent and remediate such attempts could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Unauthorized access to our services may cause us to misstate key performance indicators, which once discovered, corrected, and disclosed, could undermine investor confidence in the integrity of our key performance indicators and could cause our stock price to drop significantly._**\n\nWe may be impacted by attempts by third parties to manipulate and exploit our software for the purpose of gaining unauthorized access to our service. For example, there might be instances of third parties seeking to provide mobile device users a means to suppress advertisements without payment and gain access to features only available to the ad-supported services. If in the future we fail to successfully detect and address such issues, it may have artificial effects on our key performance indicators, such as content hours, content hours per MAU, and MAUs, which underlie, among other things, our contractual obligations with advertisers, as well as harm our relationship with them. This may impact our results of operations, particularly with respect to margins on our ad-supported segment, by increasing our ad-supported cost of revenue without a corresponding increase to our ad-supported revenue, which could seriously harm our business. Additionally, unlike our ad-supported users, individuals using unauthorized versions of our application are unlikely to convert to premium subscribers. Moreover, once we detect and correct such unauthorized access and any key performance indicators it affects, investor confidence in the integrity of our key performance indicators could be undermined. These could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. \n\n**_If we are forced to cancel or postpone all or part of a scheduled concert, our business may be adversely impacted, and our reputation may be harmed._**\n\nWe incur a significant amount of up-front costs when we plan and prepare for an online concert. Accordingly, if a planned concert is canceled, we would lose a substantial amount of sunk costs, fail to generate the anticipated revenue and may be forced to issue refunds for tickets sold. If we are forced to postpone a concert or event, we would incur substantial additional costs in connection with our having to stage the event on a new date, may have reduced attendance and revenue and may have to refund money to ticketholders. In addition, any cancellation or postponement could harm both our reputation and the reputation of the particular concert or event. We could be compelled to cancel or postpone all or part of an event or concert for many reasons, including such things as low attendance, adverse weather conditions, technical problems, issues with permitting or government regulation, incidents, injuries or deaths at that event or concert, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as pandemics, terrorist attacks, mass-casualty incidents and natural disasters or similar events.\n\n**_A deterioration in general economic conditions and its impact on consumer and business spending, particularly by customers in our targeted millennial generation demographic, could adversely affect our revenue and financial results._**\n\nOur business and financial results are influenced significantly by general economic conditions, in particular, those conditions affecting discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending. During economic slowdowns and recessions, many consumers could reduce their discretionary spending. An economic downturn can result in reduced ticket revenue and lower customer spending.\n\n**_We depend on relationships with key event promoters, sponsor and marketing partners, executives, managers and artists, and adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nOur business is particularly dependent upon personal relationships, as promoters and executives within entertainment companies such as ours leverage their network of relationships with artists, agents, managers and sponsor and marketing partners to secure the rights to the performers and events that are critical to our success. Due to the importance of those industry contacts, the loss of any of our officers or other key personnel who have relationships with these artists, agents or managers could adversely affect our venue management and event promotion businesses. While we have hiring policies and procedures and conduct background checks of our promoters, executives, managers and artists, they may engage in or may have in the past engaged in conduct we do not endorse or that is otherwise improper, which may result in reputational harm to us. Also, to the extent artists, agents and managers we have relationships with are replaced with individuals with whom our officers or other key personnel do not have relationships, our competitive position and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n13\n\n**_We may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties._**\n\nFrom time to time, we may be in the future subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement and other violations of the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties.\n\nWe may not be able to successfully defend against such claims, which may result in a limitation on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims and also might require us to enter into settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face an injunction prohibiting us from using the affected intellectual property in connection with our services. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel from the rest of our business. \n\nIn addition, music, Internet, technology, and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property rights. Many companies in these industries, including many of our competitors, have substantially larger patent and intellectual property portfolios than we do, which could make us a target for litigation as we may not be able to assert counterclaims against parties that sue us for patent, or other intellectual property infringement. In addition, various “non-practicing entities” that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert claims in order to extract value from technology companies. Further, from time to time we may introduce new products and services, including in territories where we currently do not have an offering, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities. It is difficult to predict whether assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or any infringement or misappropriation claims arising from such assertions will substantially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. If we are forced to defend against any infringement or misappropriation claims, whether they are with or without merit, are settled out of court, or are determined in our favor, we may be required to expend significant time and financial resources on the defense of such claims. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay significant damages, which may be even greater if we are found to have willfully infringed upon a party’s intellectual property; cease exploiting copyrighted content that we have previously had the ability to exploit; cease using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our solutions; enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, content, or materials; indemnify our partners and other third parties; and/or take other actions that may have material effects on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\n**_Changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business._**\n\nWe will rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the Internet. Changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. To the extent that network operators implement usage-based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our subscriber acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted.\n\n**_The success of our business and operations depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures, as well as affiliate and third-party computer systems, Wi-Fi and other communication systems. System interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructures may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nSystem interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in the information systems and infrastructures, both of our own systems and other computer systems and of affiliate and third-party software, Wi-Fi and other communications systems service providers on which we rely, may adversely affect our ability to operate websites, process and fulfill transactions, respond to user inquiries and generally maintain cost-efficient operations. Such interruptions could occur by virtue of natural disaster, malicious actions such as hacking or acts of terrorism or war, or human error. In addition, the loss of some or all of certain key personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain our software and systems and could subject us to systems interruptions.\n\n14\n\nAlthough we maintain up to date information technology systems and network infrastructures for the operation of our businesses, techniques used to gain unauthorized access to private networks are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to our systems and data. \n\n**_Privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data and compliance with privacy regulations could result in significant expense._**\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our users, we collect and utilize data supplied by our users. We may face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the Internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws, that limit our ability to use collected data, could have an adverse effect on our business. As our business evolves and as we expand internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of user information, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur significant expenses.\n\nIn addition, we cannot fully control the actions of third parties who may have access to the user data we collect and the user data collected by our third-party vendors. We may be unable to monitor or control such third parties and the third parties having access to our website in their compliance with the terms of our privacy policies, terms of use, and other applicable contracts, and we may be unable to prevent unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, user information. Any such misuse could hinder or prevent our efforts with respect to growth opportunities and could expose us to liability or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, these third parties may become the victim of security breaches or have practices that may result in a breach, and we could be responsible for those third-party acts or failures to act.\n\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us or the prior owners of acquired businesses to maintain the privacy of data relating to our users (including disclosing data in a manner that was objectionable to our users), to comply with our posted privacy policies, our predecessors’ posted policies, laws and regulations, rules of self-regulatory organizations, industry standards and contractual provisions to which we or they may be bound, could result in the loss of confidence in us, or result in actions against us by governmental entities or others, all of which could result in litigation and financial losses, and could potentially cause us to lose users, advertisers, revenue and employees.\n\n**_We do not have insurance coverage that is customary and standard for companies of comparable size in comparable industries_**\n\nAs of the date of this report, we have not obtained sufficient insurance coverage that is customary and standard for companies of comparable size in comparable industries, such as any liability insurance and insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, military conflicts, and wars, which could subject us to significant financial losses. The realization of any of these risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\n**Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Ordinary Shares**\n\n**_If we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, we would face possible delisting, which would result in a limited public market for our shares and make obtaining future debt or equity financing more difficult for us._**\n\nOn November 18, 2019, we received a notification letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Stockholder Equity Requirement”). The notification received had no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Nasdaq has provided us with 45 calendar days, or until January 2, 2020, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity standard. If our plan to regain compliance is accepted, Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notification letter, or until May 16, 2019, to evidence compliance. On January 2, 2020, we submitted our plan of compliance to Nasdaq.\n\n15\n\nOn January 24, 2020, we received a notice (the “Notice”) from Nasdaq stating that we were not able to regain compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement or the alternative criteria set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b) and that the Staff had determined to seek to delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq unless the Company requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). On January 28, 2020 we requested a hearing before the Panel. Such stays any suspension or delisting action by Nasdaq pending the completion of the hearing process. On January 30, 2020, we received a hearing instruction letter from Nasdaq stating that the delisting action referenced in the Notice has been stayed, pending a final written decision by the Panel.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, the Company appeared before the Panel to demonstrate its ability to regain compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement and subsequently submitted supplemental information to the Panel on March 23, 2020 pursuant to the Panel’s request. By a letter dated April 16, 2020, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that the Panel had determined to continue the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares based upon the Company’s compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement. Additionally, the Panel advised in such letter that is has placed the Company under a Panel Monitor (the “Monitor”) that shall last through April 15, 2021. Pursuant to that Monitor and as provided in the Nasdaq Rules, if at any time during the monitor period the Company fails to maintain compliance with any listing standard, Nasdaq will issue a Staff Delisting Determination and the Hearings Department will promptly schedule a new hearing.\n\nSeparately, on March 5, 2020, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Requirement”). The notification received has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company had until September 1, 2020 to regain compliance. If at any time during such 180-day period the closing bid price of the Company’s ordinary shares is at least $1 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company written confirmation of compliance.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2), as the Company maintained a closing bid price of $1.00 per share or greater for twenty (20) consecutive days from July 13, 2020 through August 7, 2020. On October 18, 2020, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the Bid Price Requirement again and were granted 180 days or until April 13, 2021 to regain compliance. On April 12, 2021, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2). On April 19, 2021, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that its Panel has determined to continue the listing of the Company’s securities on Nasdaq.\n\nNasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain the compliance with the Nasdaq rules. If we fail to comply with the Bid Price Requirement or any other listing rules when required in the future, we could be subject to suspension and delisting proceedings. If our securities lose their status on The NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities would likely trade in the over-the-counter market. If our securities were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our securities could be more difficult because smaller quantities of securities would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts’ coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event our securities are delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, further limiting the liquidity of our securities. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities. Such delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market and continued or further declines in our share price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions. \n\n16\n\n**_The price of our ordinary shares historically has been volatile, which may affect the price at which you could sell the ordinary shares._**\n\nOur ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CSCW.” The market price for the ordinary shares has varied between a high bid price of $2.67 on March 30, 2021 and a low bid price of $0.31 on June 4, 2020 in the 12-month period ended on May 13, 2021. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell the ordinary shares. The ordinary share price are likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the following:\n\n● | variations in our revenues, earnings and cash flows;  \n---|---  \n● | announcements of new investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors;  \n● | announcements of new offerings, solutions and expansions by us or our competitors;  \n● | changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;  \n● | detrimental adverse publicity about us, our services or our industry;  \n● | announcements of new regulations, rules or policies relevant for our business;  \n● | additions or departures of key personnel;  \n● | release of lockup or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding equity securities or sales of additional equity securities; and  \n● | potential litigation or regulatory investigations.  \n  \nAny of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our ordinary shares will trade.\n\nIn the past, shareholders of public companies have often brought securities class action suits against those companies following periods of instability in the market price of their securities. If we were to be involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management’s attention and other resources from our business and operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit, which could harm our results of operations. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n**_We do not intend to pay dividends on our ordinary shares for the foreseeable future, but if we intend to do so our holding company structure may limit the payment of dividends to our stockholders._**\n\nWhile we have no current intention of paying dividends, should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including as a result of restrictive covenants in loan agreements, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions as discussed below. If future dividends are paid in RMB, fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of RMB into U.S. dollars may reduce the amount received by U.S. stockholders upon conversion of the dividend payment into U.S. dollars.\n\nChinese regulations currently permit the payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. Our subsidiaries in China are also required to set aside a portion of their after tax profits according to Chinese accounting standards and regulations to fund certain reserve funds. Currently, our subsidiaries in China are the only sources of revenues or investment holdings for the payment of dividends. If they do not accumulate sufficient profits under Chinese accounting standards and regulations to first fund certain reserve funds as required by Chinese accounting standards, we will be unable to pay any dividends.\n\n17\n\n**_We may be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling our ordinary shares._**\n\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called “penny stocks” to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. If our ordinary shares becomes a “penny stock”, we may become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the “Penny Stock Rule”. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market.\n\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our ordinary shares will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our ordinary shares were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\n\n**_If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding the ordinary shares, the market price for the ordinary shares and trading volume could decline._**\n\nThe trading market for our ordinary shares will be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business. If industry or securities analysts decide to cover us and in the future downgrade our ordinary shares, the market price for our ordinary shares would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price or trading volume for our ordinary shares to decline.\n\n**_Techniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of our ordinary shares._**\n\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller’s interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a security short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market.\n\nPublic companies that have substantially all of their operations in the PRC have been the subject of short selling. Much of the scrutiny and negative publicity has centered on allegations of a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting resulting in financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result, many of these companies are now conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations and, in the interim, are subject to shareholder lawsuits and/or SEC enforcement actions.\n\n18\n\nIt is not clear what effect such negative publicity could have on us. If we were to become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we could have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. While we would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller by principles of freedom of speech, applicable law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation could be costly and time-consuming, and could distract our management from growing our business. Even if such allegations are ultimately proven to be groundless, allegations against us could severely impact our business operations, and any investment in our ordinary shares could be greatly reduced or even rendered worthless.\n\n**_We are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to U.S. domestic public companies._**\n\nBecause we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and regulations in the United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including:\n\n●| the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K;  \n---|---  \n●| the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act;  \n---|---  \n●| the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and  \n---|---  \n●| the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe are required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we intend to publish our results on a quarterly basis as press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Press releases relating to financial results and material events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information that would be made available to you were you investing in a U.S. domestic issuer.\n\n**_Because we are a foreign private issuer and are exempt from certain Nasdaq corporate governance standards applicable to U.S. issuers, you will have less protection than you would have if we were a domestic issuer._**\n\nNasdaq Listing Rules require listed companies to have, among other things, a majority of its board members be independent. As a foreign private issuer, however, we are permitted to, and we may, follow home country practice in lieu of the above requirements, or we may choose to comply with the Nasdaq requirement within one year of listing. The corporate governance practice in our home country, the Cayman Islands, does not require a majority of our board to consist of independent directors. Since a majority of our board of directors will not consist of independent directors, fewer board members will be exercising independent judgment and the level of board oversight on the management of our company may decrease as a result. In addition, the Nasdaq listing rules also require U.S. domestic issuers to have a compensation committee, a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors, and an audit committee with a minimum of three members. We, as a foreign private issuer, are not subject to these requirements. The Nasdaq listing rules may require shareholder approval for certain corporate matters, such as requiring that shareholders be given the opportunity to vote on all equity compensation plans and material revisions to those plans, certain ordinary share issuances. We intend to comply with the requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rules in determining whether shareholder approval is required on such matters and to appoint a nominating and corporate governance committee. However, we may consider following home country practice in lieu of the requirements under Nasdaq listing rules with respect to certain corporate governance standards which may afford less protection to investors.\n\n19\n\n**USE OF PROCEEDS**\n\nExcept as described in any prospectus supplement and any free writing prospectus in connection with a specific offering, we currently intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities offered under this prospectus to fund the development and commercialization of our projects and the growth of our business, primarily working capital, and for general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in technologies, products and/or businesses that we believe will enhance the value of our Company, although we have no current commitments or agreements with respect to any such transactions as of the date of this prospectus. We have not determined the amount of net proceeds to be used specifically for the foregoing purposes. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of any sale of the securities. If a material part of the net proceeds is to be used to repay indebtedness, we will set forth the interest rate and maturity of such indebtedness in a prospectus supplement. Pending use of the net proceeds will be deposited in interest bearing bank accounts. \n\n**DILUTION**\n\nIf required, we will set forth in a prospectus supplement the following information regarding any material dilution of the equity interests of investors purchasing securities in an offering under this prospectus:\n\n●| the net tangible book value per share of our equity securities before and after the offering;  \n---|---  \n●| the amount of the increase in such net tangible book value per share attributable to the cash payments made by purchasers in the offering; and  \n---|---  \n●| the amount of the immediate dilution from the public offering price which will be absorbed by such purchasers.  \n---|---  \n  \n20\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF SHARE CAPITAL**\n\nThe following description of our capital stock (which includes a description of securities we may offer pursuant to the registration statement of which this prospectus, as the same may be supplemented, forms a part) does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (“M&A”) and by the applicable provisions of Cayman Islands law.\n\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 Ordinary Shares. As of May 26, 2021, there were 90,356,629 Ordinary Shares outstanding.\n\nThe following description of our capital stock is intended as a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our M&A, which have been filed previously with the SEC, and applicable provisions of Cayman Islands law.\n\nWe, directly or through agents, dealers or underwriters designated from time to time, may offer, issue and sell, together or separately, up to $300,000,000 in the aggregate of:\n\n●| ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n●| preferred shares;  \n---|---  \n●| secured or unsecured debt securities consisting of notes, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness which may be senior debt securities, senior subordinated debt securities or subordinated debt securities, each of which may be convertible into equity securities;  \n---|---  \n●| warrants to purchase our securities;  \n---|---  \n●| rights to purchase our securities; or  \n---|---  \n●| units comprised of, or other combinations of, the foregoing securities.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe may issue the debt securities as exchangeable for or convertible into Ordinary Shares, preferred shares or other securities. The preferred shares may also be exchangeable for and/or convertible into Ordinary Shares, another series of preferred shares or other securities. The debt securities, the preferred shares, the Ordinary Shares and the warrants are collectively referred to in this prospectus as the “securities.” When a particular series of securities is offered, a supplement to this prospectus will be delivered with this prospectus, which will set forth the terms of the offering and sale of the offered securities.\n\n**Ordinary Shares**\n\nAs of May 26, 2021, there were 90,356,629 Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding, held of record by approximately 402 shareholders. We have never paid dividends on our Ordinary Shares. While any future dividends will be determined by our directors after consideration of the earnings, financial condition, and other relevant factors, it is currently expected that available cash resources will be utilized in connection with our ongoing operations.\n\nEach outstanding Ordinary Share entitles the holder thereof to one vote per share on all matters. Our M&A provide that elections for directors shall be by a plurality of votes. Shareholders do not have preemptive rights to purchase shares in any future issuance of our Ordinary Shares. Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and after payment of creditors and preferred shareholders, if any, our assets will be divided pro-rata on a share-for-share basis among the holders of the Ordinary Shares.\n\nThe holders of our Ordinary Shares are entitled to dividends out of funds legally available when and as declared by our board of directors (the “Board”). The Board has never declared a dividend and does not anticipate declaring a dividend in the foreseeable future. Should we decide in the future to pay dividends, as a holding company, our ability to do so and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including as a result of restrictive covenants in loan agreements, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive, ratably, the net assets available to stockholders after payment of all creditors.\n\n21\n\n_Transfer of Ordinary Shares_\n\nSubject to the restrictions set out below, any of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his, its or her Ordinary Shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or any other form approved by the Board or in a form prescribed by the stock exchange on which our shares are then listed.\n\nThe Board may, in its sole discretion, decline to register any transfer of Ordinary Shares whether or not it is fully paid up to the total consideration paid for such shares. The Board may also decline to register any transfer of any Ordinary Shares if (a) the instrument of transfer is not accompanied by the certificate covering the shares to which it relates or any other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor to, or his/her right to transfer the shares; or (b) the instrument of transfer is in respect of more than one class of shares.\n\nIf the Board refuses to register a transfer, they shall, within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to the transferee notice of such refusal.\n\nThe registration of transfers may be suspended and the register closed at such times and for such periods as the Board may from time to time determine, provided, however, that the registration of transfers shall not be suspended nor the register closed for more than 30 days in any year.\n\n_Winding-Up/Liquidation_\n\nOn a return of capital on winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares), a liquidator may be appointed to determine how to distribute the assets among the holders of the Ordinary Shares. If our assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay all of the paid-up capital, the assets will be distributed so that the losses are borne by our shareholders proportionately; a similar basis will be employed if the assets are more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital at the commencement of the winding up.\n\n_Calls on Ordinary Shares and Forfeiture of Ordinary Shares_\n\nThe Board may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their Ordinary Shares in a notice served to such shareholders at least 14 days prior to the specified time and place of payment. The shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid on the specified time are subject to forfeiture.\n\n_Redemption of Shares_\n\nWe may issue shares on terms that are subject to redemption, at our option or at the option of the holders, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by the Board.\n\n_Variations of Rights of Shares_\n\nAll or any of the special rights attached to any class of shares may, be varied with the resolution of at least two thirds of the issued shares of that class or a resolution passed at a general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class present in person or by proxy or with the consent in writing of the holders of at least two-thirds of the issued shares of that class.\n\n22\n\n_Inspection of Books and Records_\n\nThe Board shall from time to time determine whether and to what extent and at what times and places and under what conditions or regulations the accounts and books of the Company or any of them shall be open to the inspection of members not on the Board and no member (not on the Board) shall have any right of inspecting any account or book or document of the Company except as conferred by Companies Act or authorized by the Board or by the Company in a general meeting. However, the Board shall from time to time cause to be prepared and to be laid before the Company in a general meeting, profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, group accounts (if any) and such other reports and accounts as may be required by Companies Act. (See “Where You Can Find More Information”)\n\n_Issuance of Additional Shares_\n\nOur M&A authorizes the Board to issue additional Ordinary Shares from time to time as the Board shall determine, to the extent there are available authorized but unissued shares.\n\nIssuance of additional shares may dilute the voting power of holders of Ordinary Shares. However, our M&A provides for authorized share capital comprising Ordinary Shares and to the extent the rights attached to any class may be varied, the Company must comply with the provisions in the M&A relating to variations to rights of shares.\n\n_Exempted Company_\n\nWe are an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Act (as revised) (the “**Companies Act** ”). The Companies Act distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. A Cayman Islands exempted company:\n\n●| is a company that conducts its business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands;  \n---|---  \n●| is exempted from certain requirements of the Companies Act, including the filing an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies or the Immigration Board;  \n---|---  \n●| does not have to make its register of members open for inspection;  \n---|---  \n●| does not have to hold an annual general meeting;  \n---|---  \n●| may issue negotiable or bearer shares or shares with no par value (subject to the provisions of the Companies Act);  \n---|---  \n●| may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for 20 years in the first instance); and  \n---|---  \n●| may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands.  \n---|---  \n  \n_Register of Members_\n\nUnder Cayman Islands law, we must keep a register of members and there should be entered therein:\n\n●| the names and addresses of the members, a statement of the shares held by each member, and of the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid, on the shares of each member;  \n---|---  \n●| the date on which the name of any person was entered on the register as a member; and  \n---|---  \n●| the date on which any person ceased to be a member.  \n---|---  \n  \nUnder Cayman Islands law, the register of members of our Company is prima facie evidence of the matters set out therein (i.e. the register of members will raise a presumption of fact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted) and a member registered in the register of members is deemed as a matter of Cayman Islands law to have legal title to the shares as set against its name in the register of members. Once our register of members has been updated, the shareholders recorded in the register of members are deemed to have legal title to the shares set against their name.\n\nIf the name of any person is incorrectly entered in, or omitted from, our register of members, or if there is any default or unnecessary delay in entering on the register the fact of any person having ceased to be a member of our Company, the person or member aggrieved (or any member of our Company or our Company itself) may apply to the Cayman Islands Grand Court for an order that the register be rectified, and the Court may either refuse such application or it may, if satisfied of the justice of the case, make an order for the rectification of the register.\n\n23\n\n_Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability_\n\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our M&A requires us to indemnify our officers and directors for actions, proceedings, claims, losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (“Indemnified Losses”) incurred in their capacities as such unless such Indemnified Losses arise from dishonesty of such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\n\n**Preferred Shares**\n\nAs all the current authorized share capital is designated as Ordinary Shares, shareholders’ special resolution will be needed to amend the Company’s M&A to alter its authorized share capital if the Company decides to issue preferred shares and following such amendment to the Company’s M&As, a copy must be filed with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands. After such resolution and amendment to the Company’s M&As in accordance with and following filing amended and restated M&As with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands, the Board is empowered to allot and/or issue (with or without rights of renunciation), grant options over, offer or otherwise deal with or dispose of any unissued shares of the Company (whether forming part of the original or any increased share capital), either at a premium or at par, with or without preferred, deferred or other special rights or restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, return of capital or otherwise and to such persons, on such terms and conditions, and at such times as the Board may decide and they may allot or otherwise dispose of them to such persons (including any director of the Board) on such terms and conditions and at such time as the Board may determine.\n\nYou should refer to the prospectus supplement relating to the series of preferred shares being offered for the specific terms of that series, including:\n\n●| title of the series and the number of shares in the series;  \n---|---  \n●| the price at which the preferred shares will be offered;  \n---|---  \n●| the dividend rate or rates or method of calculating the rates, the dates on which the dividends will be payable, whether or not dividends will be cumulative or noncumulative and, if cumulative, the dates from which dividends on the preferred shares being offered will cumulate;  \n---|---  \n●| the voting rights, if any, of the holders of preferred shares being offered;  \n---|---  \n●| the provisions for a sinking fund, if any, and the provisions for redemption, if applicable, of the preferred shares being offered, including any restrictions on the foregoing as a result of arrearage in the payment of dividends or sinking fund installments;  \n---|---  \n●| the liquidation preference per share;  \n---|---  \n●| the terms and conditions, if applicable, upon which the preferred shares being offered will be convertible into our Ordinary Shares, including the conversion price, or the manner of calculating the conversion price, and the conversion period;  \n---|---  \n●| the terms and conditions, if applicable, upon which the preferred shares being offered will be exchangeable for debt securities, including the exchange price, or the manner of calculating the exchange price, and the exchange period;  \n---|---  \n●| any listing of the preferred shares being offered on any securities exchange;  \n---|---  \n●| a discussion of any material federal income tax considerations applicable to the preferred shares being offered;  \n---|---  \n●| any preemptive rights;  \n---|---  \n●| the relative ranking and preferences of the preferred shares being offered as to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or the winding up of our affairs;  \n---|---  \n●| any limitations on the issuance of any class or series of preferred shares ranking senior or equal to the series of preferred shares being offered as to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or the winding up of our affairs; and  \n---|---  \n●| any additional rights, preferences, qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the series.  \n---|---  \n  \n24\n\nUpon issuance, the preferred shares will be fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders will have paid their purchase price in full and we may not require them to pay additional funds.\n\nAny preferred share terms selected by the Board could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of our Ordinary Shares or adversely affect the rights and power, including voting rights, of the holders of our Ordinary Shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of holders of our Ordinary Shares will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred shares that may be issued by us in the future. The issuance of preferred shares could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult.\n\n**Description of Debt Securities**\n\nAs used in this prospectus, the term “debt securities” means the debentures, notes, bonds and other evidences of indebtedness that we may issue from time to time. The debt securities will either be senior debt securities, senior subordinated debt or subordinated debt securities. We may also issue convertible debt securities. Debt securities issued under an indenture (which we refer to herein as an Indenture) will be entered into between us and a trustee to be named therein. It is likely that convertible debt securities will not be issued under an Indenture.\n\nThe Indenture or forms of Indentures, if any, will be filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.\n\n_As you read this section, please remember that for each series of debt securities, the specific terms of your debt security as described in the applicable prospectus supplement will supplement and, if applicable, may modify or replace the general terms described in the summary below. The statement we make in this section may not apply to your debt security._\n\nEvents of Default Under the Indenture\n\nUnless we provide otherwise in the prospectus supplement or free writing prospectus applicable to a particular series of debt securities, the following are events of default under the indentures with respect to any series of debt securities that we may issue:\n\n●| if we fail to pay the principal or premium, if any, when due and payable at maturity, upon redemption or repurchase or otherwise;  \n---|---  \n●| if we fail to pay interest when due and payable and our failure continues for certain days;  \n---|---  \n●| if we fail to observe or perform any other covenant contained in the Securities of a Series or in this Indenture, and our failure continues for certain days after we receive written notice from the trustee or holders of at least certain percentage in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the applicable series. The written notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a “Notice of Default”;  \n---|---  \n●| if specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur; and  \n---|---  \n●| if any other event of default provided with respect to securities of that series, which is specified in a Board Resolution, a supplemental indenture hereto or an Officers’ Certificate as defined in the Form of Indenture.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe covenant in the Form of Indenture to deliver a certificate to the trustee annually, within certain days after the close of the fiscal year, to show that we are in compliance with the terms of the indenture and that we have not defaulted under the indenture.\n\nNonetheless, if we issue debt securities, the terms of the debt securities and the final form of indenture will be provided in a prospectus supplement. Please refer to the prospectus supplement and the form of indenture attached thereto for the terms and conditions of the offered debt securities. The terms and conditions may or may not include whether or not we must furnish periodic evidence showing that an event of default does not exist or that we are in compliance with the terms of the indenture.\n\nThe statements and descriptions in this prospectus or in any prospectus supplement regarding provisions of the Indentures and debt securities are summaries thereof, do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the Indentures (and any amendments or supplements we may enter into from time to time which are permitted under each Indenture) and the debt securities, including the definitions therein of certain terms.\n\nGeneral\n\nUnless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement, the debt securities will be direct secured or unsecured obligations of our company. The senior debt securities will rank equally with any of our other unsecured senior and unsubordinated debt. The subordinated debt securities will be subordinate and junior in right of payment to any senior indebtedness.\n\n25\n\nWe may issue debt securities from time to time in one or more series, in each case with the same or various maturities, at par or at a discount. Unless indicated in a prospectus supplement, we may issue additional debt securities of a particular series without the consent of the holders of the debt securities of such series outstanding at the time of the issuance. Any such additional debt securities, together with all other outstanding debt securities of that series, will constitute a single series of debt securities under the applicable Indenture and will be equal in ranking.\n\nShould an indenture relate to unsecured indebtedness, in the event of a bankruptcy or other liquidation event involving a distribution of assets to satisfy our outstanding indebtedness or an event of default under a loan agreement relating to secured indebtedness of our company or its subsidiaries, the holders of such secured indebtedness, if any, would be entitled to receive payment of principal and interest prior to payments on the senior indebtedness issued under an Indenture.\n\nProspectus Supplement\n\nEach prospectus supplement will describe the terms relating to the specific series of debt securities being offered. These terms will include some or all of the following:\n\n●| the title of debt securities and whether they are subordinated, senior subordinated or senior debt securities;  \n---|---  \n●| any limit on the aggregate principal amount of debt securities of such series;

Warrants may be issued independently or together with any other securities that may be sold by us pursuant to this prospectus or any combination of the foregoing and may be attached to, or separate from, such securities. To the extent warrants that we issue are to be publicly-traded, each series of such warrants will be issued under a separate warrant agreement to be entered into between us and a warrant agent. While the terms we have summarized below will apply generally to any warrants that we may offer under this prospectus, we will describe in particular the terms of any series of warrants that we may offer in more detail in the applicable prospectus supplement and any applicable free writing prospectus. The terms of any warrants offered under a prospectus supplement may differ from the terms described below. \n\n28\n\nWe will file as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, or will incorporate by reference from another report that we file with the SEC, the form of the warrant and/or warrant agreement, if any, which may include a form of warrant certificate, as applicable that describes the terms of the particular series of warrants we may offer before the issuance of the related series of warrants.

The warrant agent will act solely as our agent in connection with the warrants and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency or trust for or with any registered holders of warrants or beneficial owners of warrants. The following summary of material provisions of the warrants and warrant agreements is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the form of warrant and/or warrant agreement and warrant certificate applicable to a particular series of warrants.

Warrants may be exercised at any time up to the close of business on the expiration date shown in the applicable prospectus supplement, unless otherwise specified in such prospectus supplement. After the close of business on the expiration date, if applicable, unexercised warrants will become void. Warrants may be exercised in the manner described in the applicable prospectus supplement. When the warrant holder makes the payment and properly completes and signs the warrant certificate at the corporate trust office of the warrant agent, if any, or any other office indicated in the prospectus supplement, we will, as soon as possible, forward the securities or other rights that the warrant holder has purchased. If the warrant holder exercises less than all of the warrants represented by the warrant certificate, we will issue a new warrant certificate for the remaining warrants. If we so indicate in the applicable prospectus supplement, holders of the warrants may surrender securities as all or part of the exercise price for warrants. \n\n29\n\nPrior to the exercise of any warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares or preferred shares of the relevant class or series, holders of the warrants will not have any of the rights of holders of Ordinary Shares or preferred shares purchasable upon exercise, including the right to vote or to receive any payments of dividends or payments upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up on the Ordinary Shares or preferred shares purchasable upon exercise, if any. \n\n_Outstanding Warrants_\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, there are no outstanding warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares.\n\n**Description of Units**\n\nThe following description, together with the additional information we may include in any applicable prospectus supplement, summarizes the material terms and provisions of the units that we may offer under this prospectus.

The terms of any units offered under a prospectus supplement may differ from the terms described below.

In connection with any rights offering, we may enter into a standby underwriting or other arrangement with one or more underwriters or other persons pursuant to which such underwriters or other persons would purchase any offered securities remaining unsubscribed for after such rights offering. Each series of rights will be issued under a separate rights agent agreement to be entered into between us and one or more banks, trust companies or other financial institutions, as rights agent, that we will name in the applicable prospectus supplement.

If underwriters are used in the sale, the underwriters will acquire the securities for their own account, including through underwriting, purchase, security lending or repurchase agreements with us. The underwriters may resell the securities from time to time in one or more transactions, including negotiated transactions. Underwriters may sell the securities in order to facilitate transactions in any of our other securities (described in this prospectus or otherwise), including other public or private transactions and short sales. Underwriters may offer securities to the public either through underwriting syndicates represented by one or more managing underwriters or directly by one or more firms acting as underwriters. Unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement, the obligations of the underwriters to purchase the securities will be subject to certain conditions, and the underwriters will be obligated to purchase all the offered securities if they purchase any of them. The underwriters may change from time to time any public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers.\n\nIf dealers are used in the sale of securities offered through this prospectus, we will sell the securities to them as principals. They may then resell those securities to the public at varying prices determined by the dealers at the time of resale. The prospectus supplement will include the names of the dealers and the terms of the transaction.\n\nWe will provide in the applicable prospectus supplement any compensation we will pay to underwriters, dealers or agents in connection with the offering of the securities, and any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed by underwriters to participating dealers.\n\n32\n\n**Direct Sales and Sales Through Agents**\n\nWe may sell the securities offered through this prospectus directly. In this case, no underwriters or agents would be involved. Such securities may also be sold through agents designated from time to time.

Unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement, any agent will agree to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit purchases for the period of its appointment.\n\nWe may sell the securities directly to institutional investors or others who may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act with respect to any sale of those securities. The terms of any such sales will be described in the prospectus supplement.\n\n**Delayed Delivery Contracts**\n\nIf the prospectus supplement indicates, we may authorize agents, underwriters or dealers to solicit offers from certain types of institutions to purchase securities at the public offering price under delayed delivery contracts.

The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the commission payable for solicitation of those contracts.\n\n**Market Making, Stabilization and Other Transactions**\n\nUnless the applicable prospectus supplement states otherwise, other than our Ordinary Shares, all securities we offer under this prospectus will be a new issue and will have no established trading market. We may elect to list offered securities on an exchange or in the over-the-counter market. Any underwriters that we use in the sale of offered securities may make a market in such securities, but may discontinue such market making at any time without notice. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the securities will have a liquid trading market.\n\nAny underwriter may also engage in stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Rule 104 under the Securities Exchange Act. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the underlying security in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the securities. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the securities in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions.\n\nPenalty bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the securities originally sold by the syndicate member are purchased in a syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions. Stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the securities to be higher than it would be in the absence of the transactions. The underwriters may, if they commence these transactions, discontinue them at any time.\n\n**General Information**\n\nAgents, underwriters, and dealers may be entitled, under agreements entered into with us, to indemnification by us against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Our agents, underwriters, and dealers, or their affiliates, may be customers of, engage in transactions with or perform services for us, in the ordinary course of business.\n\n33\n\n**LEGAL MATTERS**\n\nExcept as otherwise set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement, certain legal matters in connection with the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus will be passed upon for us by Kaufman & Canoles, P.C. to the extent governed by the laws of the United States, and by Conyers Dill & Pearman to the extent governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands. If legal matters in connection with offerings made pursuant to this prospectus are passed upon by counsel to underwriters, dealers or agents, such counsel will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to any such offering. \n\n**EXPERTS**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in this prospectus for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 have been audited by Wei, Wei & Co., LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as set forth in their report thereon and incorporated herein by reference, and are included in reliance upon such report given on the authority of such firm as experts in accounting and auditing.\n\n**FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\nThe financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 are included in our Annual Report on Form 20-F, which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus.\n\n**INFORMATION INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE**\n\nThe SEC allows us to “incorporate by reference” into this prospectus the information we file with the SEC.

Since this prospectus may not contain all of the information that you may find important, you should review the full text of these documents. If we have filed a contract, agreement or other document as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, you should read the exhibit for a more complete understanding of the document or matter involved. Each statement in this prospectus, including statements incorporated by reference as discussed above, regarding a contract, agreement or other document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual document.\n\nWe are subject to the information reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that are applicable to foreign private issuers, and, in accordance with these requirements, we file annual and current reports and other information with the SEC. You may inspect, read (without charge) and copy the reports and other information we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an internet website at  _www.sec.gov_ that contains our filed reports and other information that we file electronically with the SEC.\n\nWe maintain a corporate website at https://colorstarinternational.com/. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute a part of this prospectus.\n\n**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**\n\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability. We incorporated in the Cayman Islands because of certain benefits associated with being a Cayman Islands exempted company, such as political and economic stability, an effective judicial system, a favorable tax system, the absence of foreign exchange control or currency restrictions and the availability of professional and support services. However, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of securities laws that provide significantly less protection to investors as compared to the securities laws of the United States. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the United States.\n\nAll of our assets are located in China. In addition, some of our directors and officers are residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our directors and officers, or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\n\nAccording to Conyers Dill & Pearman, our local Cayman Islands’ counsel, there is uncertainty with regard to Cayman Islands law relating to whether a judgment obtained from the United States or Hong Kong courts under civil liability provisions of the securities laws will be determined by the courts of the Cayman Islands as penal or punitive in nature. If such a determination is made, the courts of the Cayman Islands will not recognize or enforce the judgment against a Cayman Islands’ company. The courts of the Cayman Islands in the past determined that disgorgement proceedings brought at the instance of the Securities and Exchange Commission are penal or punitive in nature and such judgments would not be enforceable in the Cayman Islands. Other civil liability provisions of the securities laws may be characterized as remedial, and therefore enforceable but the Cayman Islands’ Courts have not yet ruled in this regard. Our Cayman Islands’ counsel has further advised us that a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of the United States under which a sum of money is payable other than a sum payable in respect of taxes, fines, penalties or similar charges, may be subject to enforcement proceedings as a debt in the courts of the Cayman Islands.\n\nAs of the date hereof, no treaty or other form of reciprocity exists between the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong governing the recognition and enforcement of judgments.\n\nCayman Islands’ counsel further advised that although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States or Hong Kong, a judgment obtained in such jurisdictions will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment (1) is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction, (2) imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given, (3) is final, (4) is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty, and (5) was not obtained in a manner and is of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands.\n\n**INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES**\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.\n\n35\n\n**COLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.**\n\n**$300,000,000**\n\nOrdinary Shares\n\nPreferred Shares\n\nDebt Securities\n\nWarrants\n\nRights\n\nUnits\n\n**PROSPECTUS**\n\n**The date of this prospectus is , 2021.**\n\n**PART II**\n\n**INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS**\n\n**Item 8. Indemnification of Directors and Officers**\n\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our M&A requires us to indemnify our officers and directors for actions, proceedings, claims, losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (“Indemnified Losses”) incurred in their capacities as such unless such Indemnified Losses arise from dishonesty of such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\n\n**Item 9.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement.  \n---|---  \n(iii) | To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.  \n---|---  \n  \n_provided, however_ , that paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission by the registrant pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b). \n\n(2) | That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.  \n---|---  \n  \nII-1\n\n(3) | To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.  \n---|---  \n(4) | That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:  \n---|---  \n(i) | Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and  \n---|---  \n(ii) | Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. _Provided_ , _however_ , that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.  \n---|---  \n(5) | That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:  \n---|---  \n(i) | Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;  \n---|---  \n(ii) | Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;  \n---|---  \n(iii) | The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and  \n---|---  \n(iv) | Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.  \n---|---  \n(b) | That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the registrant’s annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant to section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.  \n---|---  \n(c) | Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.  \n---|---  \n  \nII-2\n\n**SIGNATURES**\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements for filing on Form F-3 and has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of New York, State of New York, on May 26, 2021.\n\n**COLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.**  \n---  \nBy:  | /s/ Biao (Luke) Lu  \nName:  | Biao (Luke) Lu  \nTitle: |  Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer)  \nBy:  | /s/ Lili Jiang  \nName:  | Lili Jiang  \nTitle: |  Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer)  \n  \n**POWER OF ATTORNEY**\n\nEach person whose signature appears below hereby constitutes and appoints Biao (Luke) Lu and Lili Jiang, and each of them, individually, his or her true and lawful attorneys-in-fact and agents, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, in his or her name, place and stead, in any and all capacities (including his capacity as a director and/or officer of the registrant), to sign any and all amendments and post-effective amendments and supplements to this registration statement, and including any registration statement for the same offering that is to be effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and to file the same, with all exhibits thereto and other documents in connection therewith, with the SEC, granting unto said attorneys-in-fact and agents, and each of them, full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in and about the premises, as fully to all intents and purposes as he might or could do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming all that said attorneys-in-fact and agents or any of them, or his substitute, may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, this Form F-3 registration statement has been signed by the following persons in the capacities and on the date indicated.\n\n**Name** | **Position** | **Date**  \n---|---|---  \n/s/ Biao (Luke) Lu | Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board | May 26, 2021  \nBiao (Luke) Lu  \n/s/ Lili Jiang | Chief Financial Officer  | May 26, 2021  \nLili Jiang  \n/s/ Jehan Zeb Khan | Director | May 26, 2021  \nJehan Zeb Khan  \n/s/ Long Yi | Director | May 26, 2021  \nLong Yi  \n/s/ Yingxian Xiang | Director | May 26, 2021  \nYingxian Xiang  \n/s/ Hung-Jen Kuo | Director  | May 26, 2021  \nHung-Jen Kuo  \n  \nII-3\n"

(the \"Company\") dismissed Wei, Wei & Co., LLP (“Wei Wei”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.\n\nThe audit reports of Wei Wei on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the Company's fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, there were no disagreements between the Company and Wei Wei on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which disagreement(s), if not resolved to Wei Wei’s satisfaction, would have caused Wei Wei to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in its reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such periods.\n\nDuring the Company’s years ended June 30, 2019 and 2020, except with respect to the material weaknesses described below, there were no “reportable events” (defined below) requiring disclosure pursuant to Item 16F(a)(1)(iv) of Form 20-F. As used herein, the term “reportable event” means any of the items listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(v)(A)-(D) of Item 16F of Form 20-F. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management's assessment: (1) the personnel primarily responsible for the preparation of our financial statements do not have requisite levels of knowledge, experience and training in the application of U.S. GAAP commensurate with our financial reporting requirements, and (2) ineffective supervision of the Company’s internal and disclosure controls over financial reporting, which resulted in a number of internal control deficiencies that were identified as being significant. \n\nIn accordance with Item 16F(a)(3) of Form 20-F, the Company has provided Wei Wei with a copy of the foregoing disclosures and has requested that Wei Wei review such disclosures and provide a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) stating whether or not it agrees with the statements made herein. Attached as Exhibit 99.1 is a copy of Wei Wei’s letter addressed to the SEC relating to the statements made by the Company in this Report on Form 6-K.\n\nOn April 7, 2021, the Audit Committee approved the appointment of Audit Alliance LLP (\"Audit Alliance \") as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to perform independent audit services for the year ended June 30, 2021.\n\nDuring the two fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 and through the subsequent interim period to April 6, 2021, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted Audit Alliance regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or on the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the consolidated financial statements of the Company, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company that Audit Alliance concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of either a disagreement or a reportable event as described above.\n\n**Exhibits.**\n\n**Exhibit No.** | **Description**  \n---|---  \n16.1 | [Letter from Wei Wei & Co., LLP, dated April 9, 2021.](ea139331_ex16-1colorstar.htm)  \n  \n1 \n\n**SIGNATURES**\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\n\nDated: April 13, 2021\n\n**COLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.**  \n---  \nBy: | /s/ Biao (Luke) Lu  \nName:  | Biao (Luke) Lu  \nTitle: | Chief Executive Office  \n  \n2 \n"

Before making an investment in the Ordinary Shares, you should read the entire prospectus carefully for a more complete understanding of our business, including our consolidated financial statements and the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” incorporated by reference into this prospectus._\n\n**History and Development of the Company**\n\nWe are an entertainment and education company which provides online entertainment performances and online music education services via our wholly-owned subsidiary, Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”), and education service carried out via our wholly-owned subsidiary CACM Group NY, Inc. (“CACM”) and our joint venture entity, Baytao LLC.\n\nColor Star Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.) was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C-corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, we changed our name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc.\n\nOn August 20, 2018, CACM was incorporated in the State of New York and is wholly owned by us. The establishment of CACM was to expand the Company’s business in the U.S. CACM has not commenced operations. \n\nOn December 27, 2018, we consummated a re-domicile merger pursuant to which we merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Cayman Islands company and the surviving entity in the merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger adopted in July 2018. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company is now governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nOn July 16, 2019, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of the Company’s memorandum and articles of association which was approved by the Company’s shareholders, the Company’s name was changed from China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. to Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”) and its shareholders. On February 14, 2020, the Company consummated the acquisition of Sunway Kids whereby we issued 1,989,262 Ordinary Shares and $2 million of cash to be paid in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sunway Kids. The $2 million cash consideration is payable in five installments over five years according to an earn-out schedule. Sunway Kids thereby became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Sunway Kids was established on February 29, 2012, under the laws of the British Virgin Islands as an offshore holding company. On August 23, 2018, Sunway Kids established its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brave Millenium Limited (“Brave Millenium”) under the laws of Hong Kong. On December 4, 2019, Brave Millenium established Chengdu Hengshanghui Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. (“Chengdu Hengshanghui”) in China as a wholly foreign owned limited liability company (the “WFOE”). On December 9, 2019, Chengdu Hengshanghui entered into a series of variable interest entity agreements with Chengdu Hengshanghui Education Consulting Co., Ltd. (“Hengshanghui Education”). Through Sunway Kids and its variable interest entity Hengshanghui Education, we were engaged in providing education and health services to day-care and preschools in China.\n\nOn March 10, 2020, CACM entered into a certain joint venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Baydolphin, Inc., a company organized under the laws of New York (“Baydolphin”). Pursuant to the JV Agreement, CACM and Baydolphin established a limited liability company under the laws of New York, Baytao LLC (“Baytao”) that is intended to be the 100% owner of one or more operating entities in the U.S. to engage in the business of online and offline after-school education.\n\n1\n\nPrior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, our core business has been the concrete business in China. Our concrete business was negatively affected by the economic cycle and government policies. The concrete industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The entire concrete industry in the PRC’s Beijing area experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years as the Beijing government continues to enforce concrete production reformation and tightened environmental laws from late 2017 to date. The reformation causes great uncertainties for local enterprises in the construction market. Since 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down. Also, the Beijing government ordered the suspension of construction jobsites during winters to reduce air pollution since 2017. The operations of Xin Ao were also severely affected. As a result of the Company’s deteriorating cash position, we defaulted on bank loans and experienced a substantial increase in contingent liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, there was a default on a bank loan of $24,345,129. As of December 31, 2019, Xin Ao is subject to several civil lawsuits for which the Company estimated that it is more than likely to pay judgments in the amount of approximately $6.8 million (including interest and penalties of $1.6 million). During the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were additional estimated claims of approximately $0.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The Company believed it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to turn around the concrete business. As such, the Company had been actively seeking to dispose of the concrete business after the acquisition of Sunway Kids.\n\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company completed the disposition (the “Xin Ao Disposition”) of Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (“BVI-ACM”), after obtaining its shareholders’ approval on April 27, 2020 and satisfaction or waiver of all other closing conditions. Upon the closing of the Xin Ao Disposition, Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He became the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The proceeds of $600,000 from the Xin Ao Disposition have been used for the Company’s working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nOn April 27, 2020, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of its memorandum and articles of association (which was approved by the Company’s shareholders), the Company’s name was changed to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”), a Hong Kong limited company, and shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company shall acquire all of the outstanding issued shares and other equity interests in Color China from the sellers (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Color China, the Company shall issue 4,633,333 Ordinary Shares of the Company and pay an aggregate of $2,000,000 to the sellers. The Company plans to make Color China an emerging online performance and online music education provider with a significant collection of performance specific assets -- leveraging professional experience of the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) who has established good relationships with major record companies, renowned artists and entertainment agencies around the world. Immediately after the Acquisition, Color Star will own 100% of Color China. On June 3, 2020, the transaction contemplated by the Exchange Agreement was consummated when the Company issued 4,633,333 Ordinary Shares of the Company to the Sellers and the Sellers transferred all of Color China’s issued and outstanding shares to the Company.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the Company and the former shareholders of Sunway Kids entered into an Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment”) to the Share Exchange Agreement dated December 31, 2019, as amended. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company shall not make any Earn-out Payment to the former shareholders of Sunway Kids since Sunway Kids has been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and management of Sunway Kids believes it will be very difficult to achieve its projected financial results. On the same day, Sunway Kids and Yanliang Han (the “Purchaser”), an unrelated third party, entered into certain share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the Purchaser agreed to purchase Sunway Kids for cash consideration of $2.4 million consisting of $400,000 which shall be paid within a month of closing, and $2,000,000 to be paid in monthly installments of $200,000 over 10 months. Upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Disposition SPA on June 25, 2020, the Purchaser became the sole shareholder of Sunway Kids and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by Sunway Kids.\n\n2\n\nEffective October 1, 2020, the Company changed the ticker symbol of its Ordinary Shares traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market from “HHT” to “CSCW”, representing the abbreviation of “Color Star Color World.” This is the new focus of the Company’s business.\n\n**Organizational structure**\n\nBelow is the Company’s corporate structure chart as of the date of this prospectus.\n\n![](image_002.jpg)\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nWe are an entertainment and education company providing online and offline innovative music education through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Color China and CACM. We strive to offer students professional artist training platform featured by exclusive content and live interaction, with the mission of delivering world-class entertainment learning experiences and promoting entertainment exchange between U.S. and China with our strong resources and deep connections in industry. We launched our online platform Color World on September 10, 2020 and it is currently operating in China. The curriculum development created by us includes music, sports, animation, painting and calligraphy, film and television, life skills, etc., covering plenty of aspects of entertainment, sports and culture. At present, we have signed contracts with well-known international artists and more than 50 celebrity teachers have been retained to launch online lectures. The Color World platform not only has celebrity lectures, but also celebrity concert videos, celebrity peripheral products, such as celebrity branded merchandise, and artist interactive communication. We strive to build an all-star cultural and entertainment industry chain. To establish a new entertainment industry chain combining online and offline, we also plan to establish offline education institutions. The offline education base will train during the day and perform at night to make the training base a commercial operation. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our plan to establish the offline education base has been delayed. The management of the Company will adjust our plan of development in accordance with the development of COVID-19.\n\nThe management believes that we, along with our alliance, have strong industry resources and influence to become a comprehensive online academy for global “future stars”. The Company was formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd., and changed its name to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd. in May 2020. Prior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, the Company’s core business had been focusing on the concrete business in China.\n\n**Our Competition**\n\nThe online education market is rapidly expanding and estimated to reach $320 billion by 20254. With the acceleration of online learning due to social distancing, this industry is experiencing huge growth. We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is sensitive to price, content (i.e. curriculum) and quality of service. With online learning adoption accelerating and creating new opportunities, competition is heating up for companies actively competing to capture market share, with the presence of a large number of service and content providers in the market bringing huge volumes of educational content online.\n\n3\n\nWe face intense competition in our online business and compete primarily with online education providers and content sharing platforms who are already established and who are beginning to target entertainment education, with a trend of “fan culture” and “idol economies” in Asia where talent shows are popular and have launched a large number of amateur stars. We are uniquely positioned, as a comprehensive online and offline entertainment education services provider with all-star teacher lineup, as well as the strong resources and wide connections in industry. Below are a few of our closest competitors below and the unique ways we are differentiated in our view.\n\n● | MasterClass is an American online education platform on which students can access tutorials and lectures pre-recorded by experts in various fields. Unlike us who offer students a professional artists training platform featured by exclusive content and live interaction, MasterClass’ classes are typically not interactive, though at least one course included “interactive assignments” where the student acted with other students, either in person or over Skype. Classes cover topics like writing, sports, and cooking, with 33 artist instructors focused on entertainment and music teaching. MasterClass’ member subscription fee is $15/month, a little more expensive than us.  \n---|---  \n● | LearnWorlds is a stand-alone online course platform for instructors to create, sell and promote their online courses. Users will be charged at least $79 per month to either sell courses or get access to free courses, which means that everyone who is qualified (not just experts and celebrities) could create and sell their courses on the platform. Users are not offered abundant tools for marketing their courses.  \n---|---  \n● | Vimeo is an American video hosting, sharing, and services platform headquartered in New York City. Vimeo operates on an ad-free basis, and instead derives revenue by providing subscription plans for video content producers and offering software as a service (SaaS) with video creation, editing, and broadcasting tools, enterprise software solutions, as well as the means for video professionals to connect with clients and other professionals.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Our Competitive Strengths**\n\nWe differ from various other competitors in our core content of “star online + entertainment teaching” and the combination of online and offline teaching. We plan to cross the boundaries between celebrity entertainment and online knowledge-sharing, and offers students a professional artists training platform featured by exclusive content and live interaction by top artists and celebrities globally, as the first online platform to bring western artists to attract Asian students and meanwhile enabling Asian artists to enter the Western markets. The Company is well connected with Asian and Western artists, and is able to group many international superstars into its proprietary platform “Color World”. As more international stars join in, coupled with our international version App to be launched in the near future, we expect the Company will continue to expand its subscriber base and gain market share, and bring innovative changes to the current state of music education and entertainment industry. We believe we are as well positioned in the industry with our all-star instructor lineup, excellent combination of online and offline learning, as well as the strong resources and extensive connections, which we believe most competitors lack.\n\n4 | Research and Markets.

We target a large addressable market driven by the rapid expansion of global online education, and the rise of the “fan economies” in Asia where the younger generation is more willing to attend their idol’s livestream and spend money on their idols. Meanwhile, the popularity of talent competition shows in Asia has also inspired more ordinary people to enter the entertainment industry and pursue their dreams of being a star. We as a comprehensive entertainment education services provider, could address the growing demand from both fans and talents, and provide professional entertainment education to more than 2 billion people worldwide; and  \n---|---  \n● | **We are well positioned to capture market share with an experienced management team, all-star instructor lineup, and the combination of online and in-person training.** We strive to offer students professional artists training platform featured by exclusive content and live interaction and are well connected with artists from Asia and U.S., establishing strategic partnerships with top record companies and entertainment agencies.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Our Operations**\n\nWe are growing to become the world’s top online and offline celebrity entertainment sharing platform.

On September 9, 2020, we broadcasted the Color World Online Concert with ten Eastern and ten Western top artists/celebrities including Grammy-winning jazz guitarist Larry Carlton, R&B singer-songwriter Ashanti, and “Pop Music Queen” Na Ying from mainland China to global audiences via its official platform “Color World” and attracted over half a million viewers from mainland China and all over the world to watch online, reaching over 10 million hits on global social media networks, which we believe is a milestone to the Company.\n\n**Online Store**\n\nOur Color World App is expected to add an online store feature on October 25, 2020, mainly selling celebrity co-branded peripheral products including clothing, shoes, hats, watches, digital products, wine, and other categories. An increased number of active users can also be expected, as more fans join and use the App, allowing us in a more competitive position to provide complete experience for global users.\n\n**_Offline Business_**\n\n**Music Festival**\n\nWe are currently in discussion with multiple well-established music festival brands to co-organize up to 30 music festivals with different genres over the next five years in different cities across Asia and beyond. The management of the Company will closely monitor the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and adjust our plans of co-organizing the music festivals to protect the safety of our customers and employees and to comply with the applicable laws and regulations.\n\n**Our Customers**\n\nWe had no sales during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 from our continuing operations and we had no accounts receivable as of June 30, 2020. \n\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we had two customers, whose sales accounted for more than 10% of our total sales from discontinued operations. Five customers accounted for approximately 52.1% of the Company’s sales for the year ended June 30, 2019 from discontinued operations. The total accounts receivable from these customers from discontinued operations amounted to approximately $13.4 million as of June 30, 2019. \n\n**Sales and Marketing**\n\n**_Marketing Channels_**\n\nWe market our course offerings and enhance brand awareness through various online and mobile channels. We place advertisements and conduct marketing on mainstream social media platforms in China. At the same time, we also generate sales leads from word-of-mouth referrals by our students and parents of students. We believe our high quality course offerings and satisfactory student experience will continue to contribute word-of-mouth referrals.\n\nA unique approach for the online concert promotions was adopted by the Company where ticket prices were initially set very low with additional opportunities for purchasers to take part in the distribution of ticket sales in order to receive referral rewards. This indirect ticket sales model, and a large amount of resulting passive income, promises more diversified marketing strategies for online music.\n\n6\n\n**Research and Development**\n\n**_Technology and Infrastructure_**\n\nTechnology is the backbone of our highly scalable business model. Our strong technological capabilities enable us to deliver a superior student experience and improve operational efficiency. Our technology team, coupled with our proprietary artificial intelligence technology and the growing volume of data generated from our operations, has continued to identify opportunities for improvements in our technology infrastructure and applications.\n\n**_Live Broadcasting Technology_**\n\nLive broadcasting technology development has been our main focus since our inception. Currently, our proprietary live broadcasting technology makes it possible for as many as 200,000 students to join a live broadcasting class simultaneously, without compromising video quality.\n\n**Intellectual Property**\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, we have two domain names: www.colorstarinternational.com and www.color-star.cn.\n\n**Our Labor Force**\n\nAs of October 30, 2020, we employed 40 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees. As required by applicable PRC law, we have entered into employment contracts with all our officers, managers and employees. We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees and we have not experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulty in recruiting staff.\n\n**Recent Financing**\n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company and certain institutional investors entered into certain securities purchase agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to such investors an aggregate of 2,727,274 Ordinary Shares in a registered direct offering and warrants to purchase up to 2,727,274 Ordinary Shares in a concurrent private placement, for gross proceeds of approximately $1.5 million.

Investment risks can be market-wide as well as unique to a specific industry or company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the risks described in our Annual Report could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment._\n\n**_The sale of a substantial amount of our Ordinary Shares or Ordinary Shares, including resale of the Ordinary Shares issued to or issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants held by the selling shareholder in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Ordinary Shares._**\n\nWe are registering for resale up to an aggregate of 13,976,252 Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our Ordinary Shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Ordinary Shares. We cannot predict if and when selling shareholders may sell such shares in the public markets. Furthermore, in the future, we may issue additional Ordinary Shares or other equity or debt securities convertible into Ordinary Shares. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and could cause our share price to decline. \n\n**CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis prospectus and our SEC filings that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus contain or incorporate by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.

In accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), “beneficial ownership” includes any Ordinary Shares as to which the Selling Shareholders have sole or shared voting power or investment power and any Ordinary Shares that the Selling Shareholders have the right to acquire within sixty (60) days (including Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares that are currently exercisable or exercisable within sixty (60) days).\n\nThe second column indicates the number of Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by the Selling Shareholders, based on their respective ownership as of December 11, 2020. The second column also assumes the exercise of all of the Warrants held by the Selling Shareholders as of December 11, 2020, without regard to any limitations on exercise described in this prospectus or in the Warrants.\n\nThe third column lists the Ordinary Shares being offered by this prospectus by the Selling Shareholders.\n\nThis prospectus covers the resale of all of the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants that are held by the Selling Shareholders. The Selling Shareholders can offer all, some or none of their Ordinary Shares, thus we have no way of determining the number of the Ordinary Shares underlying Warrants that will be held after this offering. Therefore, the fourth and fifth columns assume that the Selling Shareholders will sell all of the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants which are covered by this prospectus.

Our directors may also decline to register any transfer of Ordinary Shares if (a) the instrument of transfer is not accompanied by the certificate covering the shares to which it relates or any other evidence as our Board of Directors may reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor to, or his/her right to transfer the shares; or (b) the instrument of transfer is in respect of more than one class of shares.\n\nIf our directors refuse to register a transfer, they shall, within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to the transferee notice of such refusal.\n\nThe registration of transfers may be suspended and the register closed at such times and for such periods as our Board of Directors may from time to time determine, provided, however, that the registration of transfers shall not be suspended nor the register closed for more than 30 days in any year.\n\n**_Winding-Up/Liquidation_**\n\nOn a return of capital on winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares), a liquidator may be appointed to determine how to distribute the assets among the holders of the Ordinary Shares. If our assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay all of the paid-up capital, the assets will be distributed so that the losses are borne by our shareholders proportionately; a similar basis will be employed if the assets are more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital at the commencement of the winding up.\n\n**_Calls on Ordinary Shares and Forfeiture of Ordinary Shares_**\n\nOur Board of Directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their Ordinary Shares in a notice served to such shareholders at least 14 days prior to the specified time and place of payment. The shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid on the specified time are subject to forfeiture.\n\n**_Redemption of Shares_**\n\nWe may issue shares on terms that are subject to redemption, at our option or at the option of the holders, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by our Board of Directors.\n\n**_Inspection of Books and Records_**\n\nDirectors shall from time to time determine whether and to what extent and at what times and places and under what conditions or regulations the accounts and books of the Company or any of them shall be open to the inspection of members not being Directors and no member (not being a Director) shall have any right of inspecting any account or book or document of the Company except as conferred by Companies Law or authorized by the Directors or by the Company in a general meeting. However, the Directors shall from time to time cause to be prepared and to be laid before the Company in a general meeting, profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, group accounts (if any) and such other reports and accounts as may be required by Companies Law. (See “Where You Can Find More Information”)\n\n**_Issuance of Additional Shares_**\n\nOur Memorandum and Articles authorize our Board of Directors to issue additional Ordinary Shares from time to time as our Board of Directors shall determine, to the extent there are available authorized but unissued shares.\n\nOur Memorandum and Articles also authorizes our Board of Directors to establish from time to time one or more series of preferred shares and to determine, subject to compliance with the variation of rights of shares provision in the Memorandum and Articles, with respect to any series of preferred shares, the terms and rights of that series, including:\n\n● | the designation of the series;  \n---|---  \n● | the number of shares of the series;  \n● | the dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights; and  \n● | the rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences.  \n  \n16\n\nOur Board of Directors may, issue preferred shares without action by our shareholders to the extent there are authorized but unissued shares available.\n\n**_Anti-Takeover Provisions_**\n\nSome provisions of our Memorandum and Articles may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company or management that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that:\n\n● | authorize our Board of Directors to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to designate the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such preferred shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders (subject to variation of rights of shares provisions in our Memorandum and Articles); and  \n---|---  \n● | limit the ability of shareholders to requisition and convene general meetings of shareholders. Our Memorandum and Articles allow our shareholders holding shares representing in aggregate not less than twenty percent of our paid up share capital (as to the total consideration paid for such shares) in issue to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders, in which case our directors are obliged to call such meeting and to put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting.  \n  \nHowever, under Cayman Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under our Memorandum and Articles for a proper purpose and for what they believe in good faith to be in the best interests of our Company.\n\n**_General Meetings of Shareholders and Shareholder Proposals_**\n\nOur shareholders’ general meetings may be held in such place within or outside the Cayman Islands as our Board of Directors considers appropriate.\n\nAs a Cayman Islands exempted company, we are not obliged by the Companies Law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings. The directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting.\n\nShareholders’ general meetings and any other general meetings of our shareholders may be convened by a majority of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors shall give not less than seven days’ written notice of a shareholders’ meeting to those persons whose names appear as members in our register of members on the date the notice is given (or on any other date determined by our directors to be the record date for such meeting) and who are entitled to vote at the meeting.\n\nCayman Islands law provides shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting, and does not provide shareholders with any right to put any proposal before a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in a company’s articles of association. Our Memorandum and Articles allow our shareholders holding shares representing in aggregate not less than ten percent of our paid up share capital (as to the total consideration paid for such shares) in issue to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders, in which case our directors are obliged to call such meeting and to put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting; otherwise, our Memorandum and Articles do not provide our shareholders with any right to put any proposals before annual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings not called by such shareholders.\n\n**_Exempted Company_**\n\nWe are an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Law. The Companies Law distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. A Cayman Islands exempted company:\n\n● | is a company that conducts its business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands;  \n---|---  \n  \n17\n\n● | is exempted from certain requirements of the Companies Law, including the filing an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies or the Immigration Board;  \n---|---  \n● | does not have to make its register of members open for inspection;  \n● | does not have to hold an annual general meeting;  \n---|---  \n● | may issue negotiable or bearer shares or shares with no par value (subject to the provisions of the Companies Law);  \n● | may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for 20 years in the first instance); and  \n● | may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands.  \n  \n“Limited liability” means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the shareholder on the shares of the company (except in exceptional circumstances, such as involving fraud, the establishment of an agency relationship or an illegal or improper purpose or other circumstances in which a court may be prepared to pierce or lift the corporate veil).\n\n**_Register of Members_**\n\nUnder Cayman Islands law, we must keep a register of members and there should be entered therein:\n\n● | the names and addresses of the members, a statement of the shares held by each member, and of the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid, on the shares of each member;  \n---|---  \n● | the date on which the name of any person was entered on the register as a member; and  \n● | the date on which any person ceased to be a member.  \n  \nUnder Cayman Islands law, the register of members of our Company is prima facie evidence of the matters set out therein (i.e. the register of members will raise a presumption of fact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted) and a member registered in the register of members is deemed as a matter of Cayman Islands law to have legal title to the shares as set against its name in the register of members. Once our register of members has been updated, the shareholders recorded in the register of members are deemed to have legal title to the shares set against their name.\n\nIf the name of any person is incorrectly entered in, or omitted from, our register of members, or if there is any default or unnecessary delay in entering on the register the fact of any person having ceased to be a member of our Company, the person or member aggrieved (or any member of our Company or our Company itself) may apply to the Cayman Islands Grand Court for an order that the register be rectified, and the Court may either refuse such application or it may, if satisfied of the justice of the case, make an order for the rectification of the register.\n\n**_Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability_**\n\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our Memorandum and Articles require us to indemnify our officers and directors for actions, proceedings, claims, losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (“Indemnified Losses”) incurred in their capacities as such unless such Indemnified Losses arise from dishonesty of such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.\n\n18\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\n\n**_Options_**\n\nAs of December 9, 2020, we have no options outstanding.\n\n**_Warrants_**\n\nAs of December 9, 2020, the following warrants were issued and outstanding:\n\n●| Warrants to purchase 11,880,000 Ordinary Shares issued on September 17, 2020. These warrants have an exercise price of $0.55 per Ordinary Share, subject to adjustment, and expire 5.5 years from the date of issuance.  \n---|---  \n●| Warrants to purchase 2,096,252 Ordinary Shares issued on July 22, 2020. These warrants have an exercise price of $1.50 per Ordinary Share, subject to adjustment, and expire 5.5 years from the date of issuance.  \n●| Warrants to purchase 50,000 Ordinary Shares issued on May 13, 2020. These warrants have an initial exercise price of $0.55 per Ordinary Share and a current exercise price of $0.04 per Ordinary Share, subject to adjustment, and expire 5.5 years from the date of issuance.  \n●| Warrants to purchase 50,000 Ordinary Shares issued on April 2, 2020. These warrants have an initial exercise price of $0.55 per Ordinary Share and a current exercise price of $0.185 per Ordinary Share, subject to adjustment, and expire 5.5 years from the date of issuance.  \n  \n**_Economic Substance Legislation of the Cayman Islands_**\n\nThe Cayman Islands, together with several other non-European Union jurisdictions, have recently introduced legislation aimed at addressing concerns raised by the Council of the European Union as to offshore structures engaged in certain activities which attract profits without real economic activity. With effect from January 1, 2019, the International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Law, (2020 Revision) (the “Substance Law”) came into force in the Cayman Islands introducing certain economic substance requirements for in-scope Cayman Islands entities which are engaged in certain “relevant activities,” which in the case of exempted companies incorporated before January 1, 2019, will apply in respect of financial years commencing July 1, 2019, onwards. As we are a Cayman Islands company, compliance obligations include filing annual notifications for the Company, which need to state whether we are carrying out any relevant activities and if so, whether we have satisfied economic substance tests to the extent required under the Cayman Economic Substance Law. As it is a new regime, it is anticipated that the Substance Law will evolve and be subject to further clarification and amendments. We may need to allocate additional resources to keep updated with these developments, and may have to make changes to our operations in order to comply with all requirements under the Substance Law. Failure to satisfy these requirements may subject us to penalties under the Substance Law.\n\n**Data Protection — Privacy Notice**\n\n**_Scope_**\n\nThe legal basis for this notification is to meet the standards required in respect of, and ensure compliance with, the requirements of the Cayman Islands’ Data Protection Law, 2017 or the “DPL,” which came into effect in the Cayman Islands on September 30, 2019. This privacy notice puts investors in the Company on notice that through your investment into the Company you may provide us with certain personal information which constitutes personal data within the meaning of the DPL (“personal data”). The Company collects, uses, discloses, retains and secures personal data to the extent reasonably required only and within the parameters that could be reasonably expected during the normal course of business. The Company will only process, disclose, transfer or retain personal data to the extent legitimately required to conduct the activities of the Company on an ongoing basis or to comply with legal and regulatory obligations to which the Company is subject. The Company will only transfer personal data in accordance with the requirements of the DPL, and will apply appropriate technical and organizational information security measures designed to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing of the personal data and against the accidental loss, destruction or damage to the personal data. In our use of this personal data, we will be characterized as a “data controller” for the purposes of the DPL, while our affiliates and service providers who may receive this personal data from us in the conduct of our activities may either act as our “data processors” for the purposes of the DPL or may process personal information for their own lawful purposes in connection with services provided to the Company.\n\nIf you are a natural person, this will affect you directly. If you are a corporate investor (including, for these purposes, legal arrangements such as trusts or exempted limited partnerships) that provides us with personal data on individuals connected to you for any reason in relation to your investment into the Company, this will be relevant for those individuals and you should inform such individuals of the content.\n\n**_What rights do individuals have in respect of personal data?_**\n\nUnder the DPL, individuals must be informed of the purposes for which their personal data is processed and this privacy notice fulfils the Company’s obligation in this respect.\n\nIndividuals have rights under the DPL in certain circumstances. These may include the right to request access to their personal data, the right to request rectification or correction of personal data, the right to request that processing of personal data be stopped or restricted and the right to require that the Company cease processing personal data for direct marketing purposes.\n\n19\n\nIf you consider that your personal data has not been handled correctly, or you are not satisfied with the Company’s responses to any requests you have made regarding the use of your personal data, you have the right to complain to the Cayman Islands’ Ombudsman. The Ombudsman can be contacted by calling: +1 (345) 946-6283 or by email at info@ombudsman.ky.\n\n**_Contacting the Company_**\n\nFor further information on the collection, use, disclosure, transfer or processing of your personal data or the exercise of any of the rights listed above, please contact us through the address and telephone number of our principal executive office. Our principal website is www.colorstarinternational.com. The information contained in, or accessible through, our website is not incorporated into this prospectus or the registration statement of which it forms a part.\n\n**Material Differences between U.S. Corporate Law and Cayman Islands Corporate Law**\n\nThe Companies Law is modeled after that of English law but does not follow many recent English law statutory enactments. In addition, the Companies Law differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the significant differences between the provisions of the Companies Law applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the State of Delaware.\n\n**_Mergers and Similar Arrangements_**. A merger of two or more constituent companies under Cayman Islands law requires a plan of merger or consolidation to be approved by the directors of each constituent company and authorization by (a) a special resolution of the shareholders and (b) such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company’s articles of association.\n\nA merger between a Cayman Islands parent company and its Cayman Islands subsidiary or subsidiaries does not require authorization by a resolution of shareholders of that Cayman Islands subsidiary if a copy of the plan of merger is given to every member of that Cayman Islands subsidiary to be merged unless that member agrees otherwise. For this purpose a subsidiary is a company of which at least ninety percent (90%) of the issued shares entitled to vote are owned by the parent company.\n\nThe consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest over a constituent company is required unless this requirement is waived by a court in the Cayman Islands.\n\nSave in certain circumstances, a dissentient shareholder of a Cayman constituent company is entitled to payment of the fair value of his shares upon dissenting to a merger or consolidation. The exercise of appraisal rights will preclude the exercise of any other rights save for the right to seek relief on the grounds that the merger or consolidation is void or unlawful.\n\nIn addition, there are statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, provided that the arrangement is approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made, and who must in addition represent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meetings, convened for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not to be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that:\n\n● | the statutory provisions as to the required majority vote have been met;  \n---|---  \n● | the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the statutory majority are acting bona fide without coercion of the minority to promote interests adverse to those of the class;  \n---|---  \n● | the arrangement is such that may be reasonably approved by an intelligent and honest man of that class acting in respect of his interest; and  \n---|---  \n● | the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Law.  \n---|---  \n  \n20\n\nWhen a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90.0% of the shares within four months, the offeror may, within a two-month period commencing on the expiration of such four month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands but this is unlikely to succeed in the case of an offer which has been so approved unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith or collusion.\n\nIf an arrangement and reconstruction is thus approved, the dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights, which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of Delaware corporations, providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares.\n\n**_Shareholders’ Suits._** In principle, we will normally be the proper plaintiff and as a general rule a derivative action may not be brought by a minority shareholder. However, based on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority in the Cayman Islands, there are exceptions to the foregoing principle, including when:\n\n● | a company acts or proposes to act illegally or ultra vires;  \n---|---  \n● | the act complained of, although not ultra vires, could only be effected duly if authorized by more than a simple majority vote that has not been obtained; and  \n---|---  \n● | those who control the company are perpetrating a “fraud on the minority.”  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability_**. Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our current memorandum and articles of association permit indemnification of officers and directors for losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred in their capacities as such unless such losses or damages arise from dishonesty or fraud of such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers that provide such persons with additional indemnification beyond that provided in our current memorandum and articles of association.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\n\n**_Directors’ Fiduciary Duties_** _._ Under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director acts in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He must not use his corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, the director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.\n\nAs a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and therefore it is considered that he or she owes the following duties to the company — a duty to act bona fide in the best interests of the company, a duty not to make a profit based on his or her position as director (unless the company permits him or her to do so) and a duty not to put himself or herself in a position where the interests of the company conflict with his or her personal interest or his or her duty to a third party. A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his or her duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his or her knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands.\n\n**_Shareholder Action by Written Consent_**. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written consent by amendment to its certificate of incorporation. Cayman Islands law and our current articles of association provide that shareholders may approve corporate matters by way of a unanimous written resolution signed by or on behalf of each shareholder who would have been entitled to vote on such matter at a general meeting without a meeting being held.\n\n21\n\n**_Shareholder Proposals_**. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, provided it complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized to do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings.\n\nCayman Islands law does not provide shareholders any right to put proposals before a meeting or requisition a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in articles of association. Our current articles of association allow our shareholders holding not less than one-third of all voting power of our share capital in issue to requisition a shareholder’s meeting. Other than this right to requisition a shareholders’ meeting, our current articles of association do not provide our shareholders other right to put proposal before a meeting. As a Cayman Islands exempted company, we are not obliged by law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings.\n\n**_Cumulative Voting._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation’s certificate of incorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since it permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder’s voting power with respect to electing such director. There are no prohibitions in relation to cumulative voting under the laws of the Cayman Islands but our current articles of association do not provide for cumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation.\n\n**_Removal of Directors._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our current articles of association, directors may be removed with or without cause, by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders.\n\n**_Transactions with Interested Shareholders._** The Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware corporations whereby, unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an “interested shareholder” for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder generally is a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target’s outstanding voting share within the past three years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target’s board of directors.\n\nCayman Islands law has no comparable statute. As a result, we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the Delaware business combination statute. However, although Cayman Islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders, it does provide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and not with the effect of constituting a fraud on the minority shareholders.\n\n**_Dissolution; Winding up._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution must be approved by shareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board. Under Cayman Islands law, a company may be wound up by either an order of the courts of the Cayman Islands or by a special resolution of its members or, if the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, by an ordinary resolution of its members. The court has authority to order winding up in a number of specified circumstances including where it is, in the opinion of the court, just and equitable to do so. Under the Companies Law and our current articles of association, our company may be dissolved, liquidated or wound up by a special resolution of our shareholders.\n\n22\n\n**_Variation of Rights of Shares._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of such class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under Cayman Islands law and our current articles of association, if our share capital is divided into more than one class of shares, we may vary the rights attached to any class with the written consent of the holders of three-fourths of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by not less than three-fourths of such holders of the shares of that class as may be present at a general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.\n\n**_Amendment of Governing Documents._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation’s governing documents may be amended with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. As permitted by Cayman Islands law, our current memorandum and articles of association may only be amended with a special resolution of our shareholders.\n\n**_Rights of Non-resident or Foreign Shareholders._** There are no limitations imposed by our post-offering amended and restated memorandum and articles of association on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on our shares. In addition, there are no provisions in our current memorandum and articles of association governing the ownership threshold above which shareholder ownership must be disclosed.\n\n23\n\n**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**\n\nThe Selling Shareholders and any of their respective pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their securities covered hereby on any trading market, stock exchange or other trading facility on which the securities are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. The Selling Shareholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling securities:\n\n● | ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;  \n---|---  \n● | block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the securities as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;  \n● | purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;  \n● | an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;  \n● | privately negotiated transactions;  \n● | settlement of short sales;  \n● | in transactions through broker-dealers that agree with the Selling Shareholders to sell a specified number of such securities at a stipulated price per security;  \n● | through the writing or settlement of options or other hedging transactions, whether through an options exchange or otherwise;  \n● | a combination of any such methods of sale; or  \n● | any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.  \n  \nThe Selling Shareholders may also sell securities under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus.\n\nBroker-dealers engaged by the Selling Shareholders may arrange for other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive commissions or discounts from the Selling Shareholders (or, if any broker-dealer acts as agent for the purchaser of securities, from the purchaser) in amounts to be negotiated, but, except as set forth in a supplement to this prospectus, in the case of an agency transaction not in excess of a customary brokerage commission in compliance with FINRA Rule 2440; and in the case of a principal transaction a markup or markdown in compliance with FINRA IM-2440.\n\nIn connection with the sale of the securities covered hereby, the Selling Shareholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the securities in the course of hedging the positions they assume. The Selling Shareholders may also sell securities short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions, or loan or pledge the securities to broker-dealers that in turn may sell these securities. The Selling Shareholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions or create one or more derivative securities which require the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of securities offered by this prospectus, which securities such broker-dealer or other financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction).\n\nThe Selling Shareholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the securities may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the securities purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. We are requesting that each Selling Stockholder inform us that it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the securities. We will pay certain fees and expenses incurred by us incident to the registration of the securities.\n\n24\n\nBecause the Selling Shareholders may be deemed to be an “underwriter” within the meaning of the Securities Act, they will be subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act, including Rule 172 thereunder. In addition, any securities covered by this prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus. We are requesting that each Selling Stockholder confirm that there is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale securities by the Selling Stockholder.\n\nWe intend to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the securities may be resold by the Selling Shareholders without registration and without regard to any volume or manner-of-sale limitations by reason of Rule 144, without the requirement for us to be in compliance with the current public information requirement under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the securities have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect. The resale securities will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale securities covered hereby may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with.\n\nUnder applicable rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, any person engaged in the distribution of the resale securities may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to the Common Stock for the applicable restricted period, as defined in Regulation M, prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition, the Selling Shareholders will be subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M, which may limit the timing of purchases and sales of the Common Stock by the Selling Shareholders or any other person. We will make copies of this prospectus available to the Selling Shareholders and are informing the Selling Shareholders of the need to deliver a copy of this prospectus to each purchaser at or prior to the time of the sale (including by compliance with Rule 172 under the Securities Act).\n\n**LEGAL MATTERS**\n\nExcept as otherwise set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement, certain legal matters in connection with the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus will be passed upon for us by Pryor Cashman LLP to the extent governed by the laws of the State of New York, and by Conyers Dill & Pearman to the extent governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands. If legal matters in connection with offerings made pursuant to this prospectus are passed upon by counsel to underwriters, dealers or agents, such counsel will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to any such offering\n\n**EXPERTS**\n\nThe financial statements incorporated by reference in this prospectus for the year ended June 30, 2020 have been audited by Wei, Wei & Co., LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as set forth in their report thereon included therein, and incorporated herein by reference, and are included in reliance upon such report given on the authority of such firm as experts in accounting and auditing.\n\n25\n\n**WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION**\n\nWe have filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form F-1 under the Securities Act relating to this offering of the Ordinary Shares. This prospectus does not contain all of the information contained in the registration statement. The rules and regulations of the SEC allow us to omit certain information from this prospectus that is included in the registration statement. Statements made in this prospectus concerning the contents of any contract, agreement, or other document are summaries of all material information about the documents summarized but are not complete descriptions of all terms of these documents. If we filed any of these documents as an exhibit to the registration statement, you may read the document itself for a complete description of its terms.\n\nYou may read and copy the registration statement, including the related exhibits and schedules, and any document we file with the SEC without charge at the SEC’s public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549. You may also obtain copies of the documents at prescribed rates by writing to the Public Reference Section of the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the public reference room. The SEC also maintains an Internet website that contains reports and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are also available to the public through the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.\n\nWe are subject to the information reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that are applicable to foreign private issuers, and under those requirements are filing reports with the SEC. Those other reports or other information may be inspected without charge at the locations described above. As a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act related to the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and our officers, directors, and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, we are not required under the Exchange Act to file annual, quarterly, and current reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as United States companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. However, we will file with the SEC, within four months after the end of each fiscal year, or such applicable time as required by the SEC, an annual report on Form 20-F containing financial statements audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, and will submit to the SEC, on Form 6-K, unaudited quarterly financial information.\n\nWe maintain a corporate website at www.colorstarinternational.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute a part of this prospectus. We have included our website address in this prospectus solely as an inactive textual reference. We will post on our website any materials required to be posted on such website under corporate or securities regulations, including posting any XBRL interactive financial data required to be filed with the SEC or any other regulatory authority, and any notices of general meetings of our shareholders.\n\n**INCORPORATION OF CERTAIN INFORMATION BY REFERENCE**\n\nThe SEC allows us to “incorporate by reference” information into this document. This means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you to another document filed separately with the SEC.

To request a copy of any or all of these documents, you should write or telephone us at 800 3rd Ave, Suite 2800, New York, NY 10022, Attention: Chief Executive Officer, (212) 220-3967.\n\n**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**\n\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability. We incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands because of certain benefits associated with being a Cayman Islands company, such as political and economic stability, an effective judicial system, a favorable tax system, the absence of foreign exchange control or currency restrictions and the availability of professional and support services. The Cayman Islands, however, has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States and provides significantly less protection for investors than the United States. Additionally, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue in the Federal courts of the United States.\n\nSubstantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, all of our directors and officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or these persons, or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\n\nConyers Dill & Pearman, our counsel with respect to the laws of the Cayman Islands has advised us that there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands would (i) recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States or (ii) entertain original actions brought in the Cayman Islands against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\n\nConyers Dill & Pearman has further advised us that there is currently no statutory enforcement or treaty between the United States and the Cayman Islands providing for enforcement of judgments. A judgment obtained in the United States, however, may be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without any re-examination on the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment: (i) is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction; (ii) is final; (iii) is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty; and (iv) was not obtained in a manner and is not of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or public policy of the Cayman Islands. Furthermore, it is uncertain that Cayman Islands courts would enforce: (1) judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against us or other persons that are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws; or (2) original actions brought against us or other persons predicated upon the Securities Act. Conyers Dill & Pearman has informed us that there is uncertainty with regard to Cayman Islands law relating to whether a judgment obtained from the U.S. courts under civil liability provisions of the securities laws will be determined by the courts of the Cayman Islands as penal or punitive in nature.\n\n27\n\n**PART II**\n\n**INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS**\n\n**_Item 6. Indemnification of Directors and Officers_**\n\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Article 42 of the Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association (the “Memorandum and Articles”) of the Company provides that every Director, Secretary, or other officer of the Company (including alternate directors, proxy directors and former directors and officers), any trustee for the time being acting in relation to the Company (including any nominee shareholder holding shares in the Company) and their heirs and personal representatives (each an “Indemnified Person”) shall be entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against all actions, proceedings, costs, damages, expenses, claims, losses or liabilities which they or any of them may sustain or incur by reason of any act done or omitted in or about the execution of the duties of their respective offices or trusts or otherwise in relation thereto, including any liability incurred by him in defending any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgement is given in his favour or in which he is acquitted except to the extent that any of the foregoing arise through his dishonesty.\n\nNo Indemnified Person shall be liable (a) for any loss, damage or misfortune whatsoever which may happen to or be incurred by the Company in the execution of the duties, powers, authorities or discretions of his office or in relation thereto, (b) for the acts, receipts, neglects, defaults or omissions of any other such Director or person or (c) by reason of his having joined in any receipt for money not received by him personally or (d) for any loss on account of defect of title to any property of the Company or (e) on account of the insufficiency of any security in or upon which any money of the Company shall be invested or (f) for any loss incurred through any bank, broker or other agent or (g) for any loss occasioned by any negligence, default, breach of duty, breach of trust, error of judgement or oversight on his part or (h) for any other loss or damage due to any such cause as aforesaid except to the extent that any of the foregoing arise through his dishonesty.\n\nThe Company shall advance to each Indemnified Person reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnified Person for which indemnity will or could be sought. In connection with any advance of any expenses hereunder, the Indemnified Person shall execute an undertaking to repay the advanced amount to the Company if it shall be determined by final judgment or other final adjudication that such Indemnified Person was not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article. If it shall be determined by a final judgment or other final adjudication that such Indemnified Person was not entitled to indemnification with respect to such judgment, costs or expenses, then such party shall not be indemnified with respect to such judgment, costs or expenses and any advancement shall be returned to the Company (without interest) by the Indemnified Person.\n\nThe Directors, on behalf of the Company, may purchase and maintain insurance for the benefit of any Director or other officer of the Company against any liability which, by virtue of any rule of law, would otherwise attach to such person in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust of which such person may be guilty in relation to the Company.\n\nInsofar as indemnification by us for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to provisions of the Memorandum and Articles, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Commission, such indemnification is against public policy and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification by such director, officer or controlling person of us in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being offered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\n\nII-1\n\n**_Item 7. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities_**\n\nDuring the last three years, we have issued securities in the following transactions, each of which was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) thereof and/or Regulation S promulgated thereunder. \n\n●| In May 2018, the Company sold 300,000 ordinary shares at $2.00 per share to certain unrelated third-party individuals;  \n---|---  \n●| In July 2018, the Company sold 45,977 ordinary shares at $6.525 per share for total proceeds of $300,000 to certain third-party individuals;  \n---|---  \n●| In August 2018, the Company sold 50,000 ordinary shares at $3.00 per share for total proceeds of $150,000 to a third-party individual;  \n---|---  \n●| In May 2019, the Company sold 200,000 ordinary shares at $2.50 per share for total proceeds of $500,000 to a third-party individual;  \n---|---  \n●| In January 2020, the Company sold 2,000,000 ordinary shares at $1.00 per share for total proceeds of $2.0 million to a third-party;  \n---|---  \n●| In January 2020, the Company issued 3,403,037 Ordinary Shares in connection with debt repayments of approximately $5.24 million;  \n---|---  \n●| In February 2020, the Company issued 1,989,262 Ordinary Shares in connection with an acquisition;  \n---|---  \n●| On April 2, 2020, the Company issued to certain institutional investors warrants to purchase up to 2,727,274 Ordinary Shares in a concurrent private placement related to a registered direct offering, in which Company sold to such investors an aggregate of 2,727,274 Ordinary Shares for gross proceeds of approximately $1.5 million.

Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules_**\n\nThe exhibit index attached hereto is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n**_Item 9. Undertakings_**\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\n\nThe undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:\n\n(1) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\n(2) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:\n\n(a) To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act;\n\n(b) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (§230.424(b) of this chapter) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and\n\n(c) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement.\n\n(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.\n\n(4) To file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement to include any financial statements required by “Item 8.A. of Form 20-F (17 CFR 249.220f)” at the start of any delayed offering or throughout a continuous offering. Financial statements and information otherwise required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act need not be furnished, provided that the registrant includes in the prospectus, by means of a post-effective amendment, financial statements required pursuant to this paragraph (a)(4) and other information necessary to ensure that all other information in the prospectus is at least as current as the date of those financial statements.\n\n(5) That for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4), or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.\n\n(6) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\nII-3\n\n**SIGNATURES**\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to

Description of Securities**.\n\nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 5. Interests of Named Experts and Counsel**.\n\nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 6. Indemnification of Directors and Officers**.\n\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Article 42 of the Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association (the “Memorandum and Articles”) of the Company provides that every Director, Secretary, or other officer of the Company (including alternate directors, proxy directors and former directors and officers), any trustee for the time being acting in relation to the Company (including any nominee shareholder holding shares in the Company) and their heirs and personal representatives (each an “Indemnified Person”) shall be entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against all actions, proceedings, costs, damages, expenses, claims, losses or liabilities which they or any of them may sustain or incur by reason of any act done or omitted in or about the execution of the duties of their respective offices or trusts or otherwise in relation thereto, including any liability incurred by him in defending any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgement is given in his favour or in which he is acquitted except to the extent that any of the foregoing arise through his dishonesty.\n\nNo Indemnified Person shall be liable (a) for any loss, damage or misfortune whatsoever which may happen to or be incurred by the Company in the execution of the duties, powers, authorities or discretions of his office or in relation thereto, (b) for the acts, receipts, neglects, defaults or omissions of any other such Director or person or (c) by reason of his having joined in any receipt for money not received by him personally or (d) for any loss on account of defect of title to any property of the Company or (e) on account of the insufficiency of any security in or upon which any money of the Company shall be invested or (f) for any loss incurred through any bank, broker or other agent or (g) for any loss occasioned by any negligence, default, breach of duty, breach of trust, error of judgement or oversight on his part or (h) for any other loss or damage due to any such cause as aforesaid except to the extent that any of the foregoing arise through his dishonesty.\n\nThe Company shall advance to each Indemnified Person reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnified Person for which indemnity will or could be sought. In connection with any advance of any expenses hereunder, the Indemnified Person shall execute an undertaking to repay the advanced amount to the Company if it shall be determined by final judgment or other final adjudication that such Indemnified Person was not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article. If it shall be determined by a final judgment or other final adjudication that such Indemnified Person was not entitled to indemnification with respect to such judgment, costs or expenses, then such party shall not be indemnified with respect to such judgment, costs or expenses and any advancement shall be returned to the Company (without interest) by the Indemnified Person.\n\nII-1\n\nThe Directors, on behalf of the Company, may purchase and maintain insurance for the benefit of any Director or other officer of the Company against any liability which, by virtue of any rule of law, would otherwise attach to such person in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust of which such person may be guilty in relation to the Company.\n\nInsofar as indemnification by us for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to provisions of the Memorandum and Articles, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Commission, such indemnification is against public policy and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification by such director, officer or controlling person of us in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being offered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\n\n**Item 7. Exemption from Registration Claimed**.\n\nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 8. Exhibits**.\n\nReference is hereby made to the Exhibit Index, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n**Item 9. Undertakings**.\n\nA. The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:\n\n(1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement:\n\n(a) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act;\n\n(b) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of this Registration Statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in this Registration Statement; and\n\n(c) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in this Registration Statement or any material change to such information in this Registration Statement;\n\n_provided_ , _however_ , that paragraphs (1)(a) and (1)(b) above do not apply if the information required to be included in a post- effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the Registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference in this Registration Statement.\n\n(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\n(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.\n\nB. The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the Registrant’s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan’s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is incorporated by reference in this Registration Statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\nC. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that, in the opinion of the Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\n\nII-2\n\n**SIGNATURES**\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all the requirements for filing on Form S-8 and has duly caused this Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of New York, State of New York on this 8th day of December, 2020.\n\n**COLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.**  \n---  \nBy: | /s/ Biao (Luke) Lu  \nName:  | Biao (Luke) Lu  \nTitle:  | Chief Executive Officer  \n  \nII-3\n\n**POWER OF ATTORNEY**\n\nKNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, the undersigned hereby constitute and appoint Biao (Luke) Lu and Lili Jiang, or either of them, his true and lawful attorney-in-facts and agent, each with full power of substitution and resubstitution, for him and in his name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, to sign any and all amendments (including post-effective amendments) or supplements to this Registration Statement, or any related registration statement filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and to file the same, with exhibits thereto, and other documents in connection therewith, with the Commission, granting unto said attorney-in-fact and agents, and each of them, full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite or necessary to be done in connection therewith, as fully to all intents and purposes as he might or could do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming all that each of said attorneys-in-fact and agents, or any of them, or their or his or her substitute or substitutes, may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, this Registration Statement has been signed by the following persons in the capacities and on the dates indicated.\n\n**Signature** | **Title** | **Date**  \n---|---|---  \n/s/ Biao (Luke) Lu | Chairman of the Board of Directors | December 8, 2020  \nBiao (Luke) Lu | and Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer)  \n/s/ Lili Jiang | Chief Financial Officer | December 8, 2020  \nLili Jiang | (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer)  \n/s/ Yingxian (Elaine) Xiang | Independent Director | December 8, 2020  \nYingxian (Elaine) Xiang  \n/s/ Hung-Jen Kuo | Independent Director | December 8, 2020  \nHung-Jen Kuo  \n/s/ Xiaoyuan Zhang | Independent Director | December 8, 2020  \nXiaoyuan Zhang  \n  \nII-4\n\n**EXHIBIT INDEX**\n\n**Exhibit No.** | **Description**  \n---|---  \n5.1* | [Opinion of Conyers Dill & Pearman (regarding validity of Ordinary Shares being registered)](ea131151ex5-1_colorstartech.htm).  \n10.1* | [Amendment No. 2 to 2019 Equity Incentive Plan of Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.](ea131151ex10-1_colorstartech.htm)  \n23.1* | [Consent of Conyers Dill & Pearman (included in its opinion filed as Exhibit 5.1).](ea131151ex5-1_colorstartech.htm)  \n23.2* | [Consent of Wei, Wei & Co., LLP](ea131151ex23-2_colorstartech.htm)  \n24.1* | [Power of Attorney (included in the signature page hereto).](#s_001)  \n  \n* filed herewith\n\nII-5\n"

Risk Factors**\n\n_An investment in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all other information contained in this annual report, including the matters discussed under the headings “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” before you decide to invest in our_ ordinary shares _. We are a holding company with substantial operations in China and are subject to a legal and regulatory environment that in many respects differs from the United States. If any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that are not presently foreseeable to us, actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and our future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected._\n\n**Risks Related to Our Business and Industry**\n\n**_We have a limited operating history with our current business model, which makes it difficult to predict our prospects and our business and financial performance._**\n\nWe have a short operating history with our current business model focusing on providing online entertainment performances and online music education services. We transitioned from a concrete business company to our current business model in 2020. Our limited history of operating under the current business model may not serve as an adequate basis for evaluating our prospect and operating results, including gross billings, net revenues, cash flows and operating margins. We have encountered, and may continue to encounter in the future, risks, challenges and uncertainties associated with operating an internet-based education business and online video streaming service industry, such as building and managing reliable and secure IT systems and infrastructure, addressing regulatory compliance and uncertainty, engaging, training and retaining high quality employees such as our teaching staff and IT support staff, and improving and expanding our education content offering. If we do not manage these risks successfully, our operating and financial results may differ materially from our expectations and our business and financial performance may suffer.\n\n**_We may require additional capital, including to fund potential acquisitions and capital expenditures, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all and which depends on many factors beyond our control._**\n\nTo support our growing business, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our platform and product offerings. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates, require additional restrictive financial and operational covenants, or require us to incur significant transaction fees, issue warrants or other equity securities, or issue convertible securities. These restrictions and covenants may restrict our ability to finance our operations and engage in, expand, or otherwise pursue our business activities and strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, and breaches of these covenants and restrictions could result in a default and an acceleration of our obligations under a debt agreement. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or our solutions under development, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.\n\nWe evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing and to an extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n**_Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19._**\n\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus causing respiratory illness, or COVID-19, has surfaced in Wuhan, China, spreading at a fast rate in January and February of 2020, and has now developed to be a global pandemic. In reaction to this outbreak, an increasing number of countries imposed travel suspensions to and from China following the World Health Organization’s “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) announcement on January 30, 2020. Since this outbreak, business activities in China and many other countries including U.S. have been disrupted by a series of emergency quarantine measures taken by the government.\n\n4\n\nAs a result, our operations in China and U.S. have been materially affected. New York, where our U.S. operations are based, is currently significantly affected by COVID-19, which led to measures taken by the New York government trying to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as reduction on the number of people in gathering and travel restrictions. Additional travel and other restrictions may be put in place to further control the outbreak in U.S. Accordingly, our operation and business have been and will continue to be adversely affected as the results of the wide-spread pandemic. Management may have to adjust or change our business plan in response to the prolonged pandemic and change of social behavior.\n\nThe extent to which COVID-19 negatively impacts our business is highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We believe that the coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to control it may have a significant negative impact on not only our business, but economic activities globally. The magnitude of this negative effect on the continuity of our business operation in China and U.S. remains uncertain. These uncertainties impede our ability to conduct our daily operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result affect our stock price and create more volatility.\n\n**_We may not be able to oversee the new joint venture efficiently._**\n\nWe may not be able to oversee Baytao, our new joint venture, efficiently, realize anticipated profits or effectively implement our growth and operating strategies. We will need to transition from a company with our primary operations in China to a company capable of supporting operations in both China and the United States. We might not be successful in such a transition. There can be no guarantee that the addition of the new joint venture will not cause us to incur additional debt and increase our exposure to market and other risks. Our failure to successfully pursue our strategies or effectively operate the joint venture entity could also have a material adverse effect on our rate of growth and operating performance.\n\n5\n\n**_If we are unable to operate the “Color World” platform as planned, our results of operation will be significantly impacted._**\n\nWe launched the “Color World” platform on October 15, 2020. The attractiveness of our platform to our prospective “Star Teachers” and student subscribers depends on our ability to innovate. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and expand our platform and education services. We must also continue to enhance and improve our technology infrastructure. These efforts may require us to develop or license increasingly complex technologies. In addition, new education services and technologies developed and introduced by competitors could render our education services and technologies obsolete if we are unable to update or modify our own technology. Developing and integrating new education services and technologies into our existing platform and infrastructure could be expensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, any new features and functions may not achieve market acceptance. We may not succeed in implementing new technologies, or may incur substantial costs in doing so. Our platform and education services must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order for us to recoup our investments. Our platform and education services could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:\n\n●| we may fail to predict market demand accurately and to provide education services that meet this demand in a timely fashion;  \n---|---  \n● | our marketing efforts may be inefficient and fail to attract the potential users;  \n---|---  \n● | Star Teachers that we recruit on our platforms may not like, find useful or agree with any changes;  \n---|---  \n● | there may be defects, errors or failures on our platform;  \n---|---  \n● | there may be negative publicity about our platforms’ performance or effectiveness; and  \n---|---  \n● | there may be competing services or technologies introduced or anticipated to be introduced by our competitors.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf our platform and education services or technologies do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n**_Our success relies on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and qualified key personnel, and our business may be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate them._**\n\nOur business operations depend on the continued services of our senior management team and qualified key personnel, particularly our executive officers and the senior management of Color China, our wholly owned subsidiary.\n\nAlthough we have provided different incentives to our senior management team, we cannot assure you that we can continue to retain their services. One or more of our key executives may be unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions. Meanwhile, we have also provided attractive compensation packages to our qualified key personnel. However, we may not be able to hire and retain these personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Some of the companies with which we compete for qualified and skilled personnel have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. In addition, we invest significant time and resources in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them.\n\nIf we are unable to retain the services of our senior management team or qualified key personnel, we may not be able to find suitable replacements or may incur significant expenses in finding such replacements, thus our future growth may be constrained, our business may be severely disrupted and our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, although we have entered into confidentiality and non-competition agreements with our senior management team and qualified key personnel, there is no assurance that any member of our senior management team or any of our qualified key personnel will not join a competitor. In the event that any dispute arises between us, on one hand, and any of our senior management and qualified key personnel, on the other hand, we may have to incur substantial costs and expenses in order to enforce such agreements, or we may be unable to enforce them at all.\n\n6\n\n**_If we are unable to recruit “Star Teachers” as planned or if these instructors do not perform according to the agreements we have with them, the operation of our performance support and music education business will be negatively impacted._**\n\nProfessional artists and producers that we have begun recruiting as our Star Teachers help us build and maintain the quality of our education and services, as well as our brand and reputation. Our ability to continue to attract recruit the instructors with the necessary experience and qualifications is a key factor in the success of our operations. We seek to continue hiring experienced and successful professionals in music, film, sports, animation, television, presentations, dance, art and other entertainment industries whom are able to follow our education service protocols and deliver effective instructions based on the agreements we have with them. The market for the recruitment of these professionals is competitive, and we must also provide continued training to ensure that our instructors stay abreast of changes in student demands, teaching methodologies and other necessary changes.\n\nIn order to recruit these industry professionals as instructors on our platform, we must provide candidates with competitive compensation packages. Although we have not experienced major difficulties in recruiting or training qualified instructors thus far, we cannot guarantee we will be able to continue to recruit, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified instructors in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n**_If we are unable to reach a critical mass of subscribers, our revenues may not be sufficient to cover the costs of our recruitment of Star Teachers._**\n\nWe are obligated to pay each of our Star Teachers on a case-by-case basis depending on the results of our negotiations. Some Star Teachers will accept fixed payments following a predefined schedule, whereas others may instead request a revenue sharing payment model whereby we will need to distribute to the Star Teachers a percentage of the net income earned from generated sales, licensing or other revenue from their courses on our platform, including a pro rata share of our subscription fees, or a hybrid of the two. If we are unable to generate enough revenue from our subscription fees from our users to cover our Star Teachers’ recruitment costs, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n**_Our education service revenue model depends on developing a subscriber base of users. If we fail to reach a critical mass of subscribers, our net revenues may not be sufficient, and we may not be able to implement our business plan._**\n\nWe expect to generate revenue primarily from the fees we collect from our users. It is critical for us to enroll subscribers in a cost-effective manner. Some of the factors, many of which are largely beyond our control, could prevent us from successfully increasing subscriptions in a cost-effective manner, or at all. These factors include, among other things, (i) reduced interest in the products and services we offer; (ii) negative publicity or perceptions regarding us, or electronic education services in general; (iii) the emergence of alternative technologies not offered by us; (iv) the inability of subscribers to pay the fees; (v) increasing market competition, particularly price reductions by competitors that we are unable or unwilling to match; and (vi) adverse changes in relevant government policies or general economic conditions. If one or more of these factors reduce market demand for our services, our subscriber base may not materialize as anticipated or our costs associated with subscriber acquisition and retention could increase, or both, any of which could materially affect our ability to grow our gross billings and net revenues. These developments could also harm our brand and reputation, which would negatively impact our ability to establish or expand our business.\n\n7\n\n**_We expect to rely heavily on information and technology to operate our existing and future education products and services, and any cybersecurity incident or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could result in the loss of critical confidential information or adversely impact our reputation, business or results of operations._**\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and to compete effectively depends in part upon the satisfactory performance and reliability of our technology network, including the ability to provide features of services that are important to our customers and to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers. We also rely on our technology to maintain and process various operating and financial data that are essential to the day-to-day operation of our business and formulation of our development strategies. Our business operations and growth prospects depend on our ability to maintain and make timely and cost-effective enhancements and upgrades to our technology system and to introduce innovative additions that can meet changing operational needs in future. Therefore, we expect to continue to invest in advanced information technology and any equipment to enhance operational efficiency and reliability as we grow. Accordingly, any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our IT infrastructure could damage our reputation, decrease user satisfaction and retention, adversely impact our ability to attract new users and expand our service and product offerings, and materially disrupt our operations. If any of these occur, our business operations, reputation and prospects could be harmed.\n\n**_If our security measures are breached or fail and result in unauthorized disclosure of data by our employees or our third-party agents, we could lose existing subscribers, fail to attract new subscribers and be exposed to protracted and costly litigation._**\n\nMaintaining platform security is of critical importance to our subscribers because the platform stores and transmits proprietary and confidential information, which may include sensitive personally identifiable information that may be subject to stringent legal and regulatory obligations. As an electronic education service provider, we face an increasing number of threats to our IT infrastructure, including unauthorized activity and access by our employees or third-party agents, system viruses, worms, malicious code and organized cyber-attacks, which could breach our security and disrupt our business. We hope to introduce data security and confidentiality protocols into the cooperation agreements we enter into with third-party sales agents with whom we share prospective subscribers’ contact information. As we expand, we hope to invest in improving our technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans to prevent unauthorized access of confidential or sensitive personal information by our employees and third-party sales agents in the process of engaging prospective subscribers.\n\nThese measures, however, may not be as effective as we anticipate. In addition, there is no assurance that our third-party sales agents will comply with contractual and legal requirements with respect to data privacy when they collect data from our prospective customers. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, we could be subject to liability or our business could be interrupted, potentially over an extended period of time. Any or all of these issues could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to attract and enroll prospective subscribers, cause prospective subscribers not to enroll or stay enrolled, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability. Further, any reputational damage resulting from breach of our security measures could create distrust of our company by prospective subscribers or investors. We may be required to expend significant management time and additional resources to protect against the threat of these disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such disruptions or breaches.\n\n8\n\n**_Privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our user data and disclosure of user data could adversely impact our business and reputation._**\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business and in particular in connection with conducting sales and marketing activities with our existing and prospective subscribers as well as the utilization of our AI-powered platform programs, we collect and utilize data supplied by our users. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our users in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results.\n\nInternationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\n**_We face regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to the licensing requirement for the online transmission of internet audio-visual programs in China._**\n\nOn December 20, 2007, the National Radio and Television Administration f/k/a known as the State Administration of Press Publication Radio Film and Television, or SAPPRFT, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, jointly promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Internet Audio Visual Program Services, or the Audio Visual Program Provisions, which became effective on January 31, 2008 and were amended on August 28, 2015. Among other things, the Audio Visual Program Provisions stipulate that no entities or individuals may provide Internet audio-visual program services without a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs issued by SAPPRFT or completing the relevant filing with SAPPRFT or its local bureaus, and only state-owned or state-controlled entities are eligible to apply for a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs. On April 1, 2010, SAPPRFT promulgated the Provisional Implementations of Tentative Categories of Internet Audio Visual Program Services, or the Categories, which clarified the scope of Internet audio-visual programs services, which was amended on March 10, 2017. According to the Categories, there are four categories of Internet audio-visual program services which are further divided into seventeen sub-categories. Sub-category No. 3 to the second category covers the making and editing of certain specialized audio-visual programs concerning, among other things, educational content, and broadcasting such content to the general public online. Sub-category No. 5 of the first category and sub-category No. 7 of the second category cover the live broadcasting of important political, martial, economic, social, cultural, sports activities or events or general social or community cultural activities, sports games and other organized activities. However, there are still significant uncertainties relating to the interpretation and implementation of the Audio Visual Program Provisions, in particular, the scope of “internet audio-visual programs.” See “Regulations Relating to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs.”\n\nWe plan to deliver our courses in live streaming format worldwide. Our teachers and students communicate and interact live with each other via our virtual learning community. The audio and video data will likely be transmitted through the platforms between specific recipients instantly without any further redaction. We believe the nature of the raw data we transmit will distinguish us from general providers of internet audio-visual program services, such as the operator of online video websites, and the provision of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions are not applicable with regard to our offering of the courses. However, we cannot assure you that the competent PRC government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to our opinion. In addition, we also plan to offer video recordings of live streaming courses and certain other audio-video contents on our electronic platforms to our students as supplementary course materials on our platforms. If the government authorities determine that our offering of the courses fall within the relevant category of Internet audio-visual program services under the Categories, we may be required to obtain the License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs.\n\n9\n\nThe Categories describe “Internet audio-visual program services” in a very broad, vague manner and are unclear as to whether electronic courses, whether delivered in a live streaming format or through video recordings, fall into the definition of audio-visual programs. We have made inquiries to the relevant bureaus of SAPPRFT and were informed that online educational content provided through live streaming or recorded courses does not fall within the scope of internet audio-visual programs, the transmission of which does not require a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs. We cannot assure you that the PRC government will not ultimately take a view that live streaming or recorded courses or any other content offered on our platforms are subject to the Audio Visual Program Provisions. We currently do not hold a license for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs, and since we are not a state-owned or state-controlled entity, we are not eligible to apply for such license. If the PRC government determines that our content should be considered as “internet audio- visual programs” for the purpose of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, we may be required to obtain a license for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs. We are, however, not eligible apply for such license since we are not a state-owned or state-controlled entity. If this were to occur, we may be subject to penalties, fines, legal sanctions or an order to suspend the provision of our live streaming courses. As of the date of this annual report, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities regarding the lack of a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs in conducting of our business.\n\n**_Our failure to obtain and maintain approvals, licenses or permits in China applicable to our business could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations in the future._**\n\nAs we plan to deliver our courses in live streaming format worldwide, including in China, we may be subject to various regulations by a number of PRC regulatory authorities, such as the SAIC, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the MITT, the National Radio and Television Administration, and the State Council Information Office, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Welfare. We may be required in the future to obtain additional government approvals, licenses and permits in connection with our operations.\n\nBy way of example, depending upon regulatory interpretation, under the current PRC laws and regulations, the provision of our educational content through our electronic platform may be considered “online publishing” and may require us to obtain an Internet Publishing License, which we currently do not have.\n\nAs of the date of this report, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities regarding the lack of any the above-mentioned approvals, licenses or permits. However, we cannot guarantee that the government authorities will not impose any penalties or sanctions on us in the future, which may include warnings, fines, mandates to remedy any violations, confiscation of the gains derived from the services for which approvals, licenses or permits are required, and/or an order to cease to provide such services. In addition, we cannot guarantee that the government will not promulgate new laws and regulations that require additional licenses, permits and/or approvals for the operation of any of our existing or future business. If we are unable to obtain such licenses, permits, or approvals in a timely fashion, we could be subject to penalties and operational disruption and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n**_We face intense competition which could adversely affect our results of operations and market share._**\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is sensitive to price, content (_i.e._ , curriculum) and quality of service. Some of our competitors may have more financial resources, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do, or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to obtain or raise capital and enter into strategic relationships more easily. We also compete with leading domestic supplier companies based on a number of factors including business model, operational capabilities, cost control and service quality, as well as in-house delivery capabilities to serve their logistics needs and compete with us.\n\nWe are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that affect many other businesses, including but not limited to:\n\n(1) | Increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare benefits;  \n---|---  \n  \n10\n\n(2) | The increasing costs of compliance with federal, state and foreign governmental agency mandates;  \n---|---  \n(3) | Any impacts on our business resulting from new domestic and international government laws and regulation;  \n---|---  \n(4) | Market conditions in the childhood education industry or the economy as a whole;  \n---|---  \n(5) | Market acceptance of our new service and growth initiatives;  \n---|---  \n(6) | Announcements of the introduction of new products and services by our competitors;  \n---|---  \n(7) | The impact of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our products and services;  \n---|---  \n(8) | Developments concerning current or future strategic collaborations; and  \n---|---  \n(9) | Widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis such as we are currently experiencing with the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf we are unable to respond to these changing market conditions, our business and financial results may be materially affected.\n\n**_We may be unable to fund any significant up-front and/or guaranteed payment cash requirements associated with our live music streaming rights, which could result in the inability to secure and retain such streaming rights and may limit our operating flexibility, which may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition._**\n\nIn order to secure event and festival live music streaming rights or hold concerts, we may be required to fund significant up-front and/or guaranteed payment cash requirements to artists or festival or event promoters prior to the event or festival taking place. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand or available capacity to advance the necessary cash for any given artist, event or festival, we would not be able to retain the rights for that artist, festival or event, such counter parties may be able to terminate their content acquisition agreements with us, and as a result our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\n**_We may be unsuccessful in developing our original content._**\n\nWe plan to continue to produce original classes, covering various areas such as singing and dancing, etc. We believe that a positive reputation with users concerning our original content is important in attracting and retaining users. To the extent our content is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to users, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. If the original content we produce does not attract new users, we may not be able to cover our expenses to produce such programs, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\nAs we continue to develop our original content, we will become responsible for higher production costs and other expenses. We may also take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. To the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\n\n11\n\n**_We face competition for users’ attention and time._**\n\nThe market for entertainment video content is intensively competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as (i) interactive on-demand audio content and pre-recorded entertainment, (ii) broadcast radio providers, including terrestrial and Internet radio providers, (iii) cable, satellite and Internet television and movie content providers, (iv) video gaming providers and (v) other sources of entertainment for our users’ attention and time. These content and service providers pose a competitive threat to the extent existing or potential users choose to consume their content or use their services rather than our content or our services. The online marketplace for live music and music-related content may rapidly evolve and provide users with a number of alternatives or new access models, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n**_Our services and software are highly technical and may contain undetected software bugs or vulnerabilities, which could manifest in ways that could seriously harm our reputation and our business._**\n\nOur services and software are highly technical and complex. Our services or any other products we may introduce in the future, may contain undetected software bugs, hardware errors, and other vulnerabilities. These bugs and errors can manifest in any number of ways in our products, including through diminished performance, security vulnerabilities, malfunctions, or even permanently disabled products. We have a practice of regularly updating our products and some errors in our products may be discovered only after a product has been used by users, and may in some cases be detected only under certain circumstances or after extended use. Any errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities discovered in our code or backend after release could damage our reputation, drive away users, allow third parties to manipulate or exploit our software (including, for example, providing mobile device users a means to suppress advertisements without payment and gain access to features only available to the ad-supported service), lower revenue and expose us to claims for damages, any of which could seriously harm our business. Additionally, errors, bugs, or other vulnerabilities may—either directly or if exploited by third parties—affect our ability to make accurate royalty payments.\n\nWe also could face claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention and seriously harm our reputation and our business. In addition, if our liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be seriously harmed.\n\n**_Our business depends on a strong developing brand, and any failure to create, maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to attract and/ or expand our base of users._**\n\nMaintaining, protecting and enhancing our brand is critical to expanding our base of users and star teachers, and will depend largely on our ability to continue to develop and provide an innovative and high-quality experience for our users and to attract more celebrities to work with us, which we may not do successfully. Our brands may be impaired by a number of other factors, including any failure to keep pace with technological advances on our platform or with our services, slower load times for our services, a decline in the quality or quantity of the content available on our services, a failure to protect our intellectual property rights or any alleged violations of law, regulations, or public policy. If we do not successfully maintain a strong brand, our business could be harmed.\n\n**_We are at risk of attempts at unauthorized access to our services, and failure to effectively prevent and remediate such attempts could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Unauthorized access to our services may cause us to misstate key performance indicators, which once discovered, corrected, and disclosed, could undermine investor confidence in the integrity of our key performance indicators and could cause our stock price to drop significantly._**\n\nWe may be impacted by attempts by third parties to manipulate and exploit our software for the purpose of gaining unauthorized access to our service. For example, there might be instances of third parties seeking to provide mobile device users a means to suppress advertisements without payment and gain access to features only available to the ad-supported services. If in the future we fail to successfully detect and address such issues, it may have artificial effects on our key performance indicators, such as content hours, content hours per MAU, and MAUs, which underlie, among other things, our contractual obligations with advertisers, as well as harm our relationship with them. This may impact our results of operations, particularly with respect to margins on our ad-supported segment, by increasing our ad-supported cost of revenue without a corresponding increase to our ad-supported revenue, which could seriously harm our business. Additionally, unlike our ad-supported users, individuals using unauthorized versions of our application are unlikely to convert to premium subscribers. Moreover, once we detect and correct such unauthorized access and any key performance indicators it affects, investor confidence in the integrity of our key performance indicators could be undermined. These could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. \n\n12\n\n**_If we are forced to cancel or postpone all or part of a scheduled concert, our business may be adversely impacted, and our reputation may be harmed._**\n\nWe incur a significant amount of up-front costs when we plan and prepare for an online concert. Accordingly, if a planned concert is canceled, we would lose a substantial amount of sunk costs, fail to generate the anticipated revenue and may be forced to issue refunds for tickets sold. If we are forced to postpone a concert or event, we would incur substantial additional costs in connection with our having to stage the event on a new date, may have reduced attendance and revenue and may have to refund money to ticketholders. In addition, any cancellation or postponement could harm both our reputation and the reputation of the particular concert or event. We could be compelled to cancel or postpone all or part of an event or concert for many reasons, including such things as low attendance, adverse weather conditions, technical problems, issues with permitting or government regulation, incidents, injuries or deaths at that event or concert, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as pandemics, terrorist attacks, mass-casualty incidents and natural disasters or similar events.\n\n**_A deterioration in general economic conditions and its impact on consumer and business spending, particularly by customers in our targeted millennial generation demographic, could adversely affect our revenue and financial results._**\n\nOur business and financial results are influenced significantly by general economic conditions, in particular, those conditions affecting discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending. During economic slowdowns and recessions, many consumers could reduce their discretionary spending. An economic downturn can result in reduced ticket revenue and lower customer spending.\n\n**_We depend on relationships with key event promoters, sponsor and marketing partners, executives, managers and artists, and adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nOur business is particularly dependent upon personal relationships, as promoters and executives within entertainment companies such as ours leverage their network of relationships with artists, agents, managers and sponsor and marketing partners to secure the rights to the performers and events that are critical to our success. Due to the importance of those industry contacts, the loss of any of our officers or other key personnel who have relationships with these artists, agents or managers could adversely affect our venue management and event promotion businesses. While we have hiring policies and procedures and conduct background checks of our promoters, executives, managers and artists, they may engage in or may have in the past engaged in conduct we do not endorse or that is otherwise improper, which may result in reputational harm to us. Also, to the extent artists, agents and managers we have relationships with are replaced with individuals with whom our officers or other key personnel do not have relationships, our competitive position and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n**_We may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties._**\n\nFrom time to time, we may be in the future subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement and other violations of the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties.\n\nWe may not be able to successfully defend against such claims, which may result in a limitation on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims and also might require us to enter into settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face an injunction prohibiting us from using the affected intellectual property in connection with our services. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and may divert the attention of our management and technical personnel from the rest of our business. \n\n13\n\nIn addition, music, Internet, technology, and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property rights. Many companies in these industries, including many of our competitors, have substantially larger patent and intellectual property portfolios than we do, which could make us a target for litigation as we may not be able to assert counterclaims against parties that sue us for patent, or other intellectual property infringement. In addition, various “non-practicing entities” that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert claims in order to extract value from technology companies. Further, from time to time we may introduce new products and services, including in territories where we currently do not have an offering, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities. It is difficult to predict whether assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or any infringement or misappropriation claims arising from such assertions will substantially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. If we are forced to defend against any infringement or misappropriation claims, whether they are with or without merit, are settled out of court, or are determined in our favor, we may be required to expend significant time and financial resources on the defense of such claims. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay significant damages, which may be even greater if we are found to have willfully infringed upon a party’s intellectual property; cease exploiting copyrighted content that we have previously had the ability to exploit; cease using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign our solutions; enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, content, or materials; indemnify our partners and other third parties; and/or take other actions that may have material effects on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\n**_Changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business._**\n\nWe will rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the Internet. Changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business. To the extent that network operators implement usage-based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our subscriber acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted.\n\n**_The success of our business and operations depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures, as well as affiliate and third-party computer systems, Wi-Fi and other communication systems. System interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructures may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nSystem interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in the information systems and infrastructures, both of our own systems and other computer systems and of affiliate and third-party software, Wi-Fi and other communications systems service providers on which we rely, may adversely affect our ability to operate websites, process and fulfill transactions, respond to user inquiries and generally maintain cost-efficient operations. Such interruptions could occur by virtue of natural disaster, malicious actions such as hacking or acts of terrorism or war, or human error. In addition, the loss of some or all of certain key personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain our software and systems and could subject us to systems interruptions.\n\nAlthough we maintain up to date information technology systems and network infrastructures for the operation of our businesses, techniques used to gain unauthorized access to private networks are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to our systems and data. \n\n**_Privacy concerns could limit our ability to leverage our subscriber data and compliance with privacy regulations could result in significant expense._**\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with merchandising our service to our users, we collect and utilize data supplied by our users. We may face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Other businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data collected on the Internet regarding users’ browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws, that limit our ability to use collected data, could have an adverse effect on our business. As our business evolves and as we expand internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of user information, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur significant expenses.\n\n14\n\nIn addition, we cannot fully control the actions of third parties who may have access to the user data we collect and the user data collected by our third-party vendors. We may be unable to monitor or control such third parties and the third parties having access to our website in their compliance with the terms of our privacy policies, terms of use, and other applicable contracts, and we may be unable to prevent unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, user information. Any such misuse could hinder or prevent our efforts with respect to growth opportunities and could expose us to liability or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, these third parties may become the victim of security breaches or have practices that may result in a breach, and we could be responsible for those third-party acts or failures to act.\n\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us or the prior owners of acquired businesses to maintain the privacy of data relating to our users (including disclosing data in a manner that was objectionable to our users), to comply with our posted privacy policies, our predecessors’ posted policies, laws and regulations, rules of self-regulatory organizations, industry standards and contractual provisions to which we or they may be bound, could result in the loss of confidence in us, or result in actions against us by governmental entities or others, all of which could result in litigation and financial losses, and could potentially cause us to lose users, advertisers, revenue and employees.\n\n**_We do not have insurance coverage that is customary and standard for companies of comparable size in comparable industries_**\n\nAs of the date of this report, we have not obtained sufficient insurance coverage that is customary and standard for companies of comparable size in comparable industries, such as any liability insurance and insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, military conflicts, and wars, which could subject us to significant financial losses. The realization of any of these risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\n**Risks Related to the Ownership of Our ordinary shares**\n\n**_If we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, we would face possible delisting, which would result in a limited public market for our shares and make obtaining future debt or equity financing more difficult for us._**\n\nOn November 18, 2019, we received a notification letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Stockholder Equity Requirement”). The notification received had no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Nasdaq has provided us with 45 calendar days, or until January 2, 2020, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity standard. If our plan to regain compliance is accepted, Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notification letter, or until May 16, 2019, to evidence compliance. On January 2, 2020, we submitted our plan of compliance to Nasdaq.\n\nOn January 24, 2020, we received a notice (the “Notice”) from Nasdaq stating that we were not able to regain compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement or the alternative criteria set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b) and that the Staff had determined to seek to delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq unless the Company requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). On January 28, 2020 we requested a hearing before the Panel. Such request will stay any suspension or delisting action by Nasdaq pending the completion of the hearing process. On January 30, 2020, we received a hearing instruction letter from Nasdaq stating that the delisting action referenced in the Notice has been stayed, pending a final written decision by the Panel.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, the Company appeared before the Panel to demonstrate its ability to regain compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement and subsequently submitted supplemental information to the Panel on March 23, 2020 pursuant to the Panel’s request. By a letter dated April 16, 2020, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that the Panel had determined to continue the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares based upon the Company’s compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement. Additionally, the Panel advised in such letter that is has placed the Company under a Panel Monitor (the “Monitor”) that shall last through April 15, 2021. Pursuant to that Monitor and as provided in the Nasdaq Rules, if at any time during the monitor period the Company fails to maintain compliance with any listing standard, Nasdaq will issue a Staff Delisting Determination and the Hearings Department will promptly schedule a new hearing.\n\n15\n\nSeparately, on March 5, 2020, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Requirement”). The notification received has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company had until September 1, 2020 to regain compliance. If at any time during such 180-day period the closing bid price of the Company’s ordinary shares is at least $1 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company written confirmation of compliance.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2), as the Company maintained a closing bid price of $1.00 per share or greater for twenty (20) consecutive days from July 13, 2020 through August 7, 2020. On October 18, 2020, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the Bid Price Requirement again and were granted 180 days or until April 13, 2021 to regain compliance.\n\nNasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain the compliance with the Nasdaq rules. If we fail to comply with the Bid Price Requirement or any other listing rules when required in the future, we could be subject to suspension and delisting proceedings. If our securities lose their status on The NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities would likely trade in the over-the-counter market. If our securities were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our securities could be more difficult because smaller quantities of securities would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts’ coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event our securities are delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, further limiting the liquidity of our securities. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities. Such delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market and continued or further declines in our share price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions. \n\n**_The price of our ordinary shares historically has been volatile, which may affect the price at which you could sell the ordinary shares._**\n\nOur ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CSCW.” The market price for the ordinary shares has varied between a high bid price of $3.00 on September 17, 2019 and a low bid price of $0.31 on June 4, 2020 in the 12-month period ended on October 15, 2020. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell the ordinary shares. The ordinary share price are likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the following:\n\n● | variations in our revenues, earnings and cash flows;  \n---|---  \n● | announcements of new investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors;  \n● | announcements of new offerings, solutions and expansions by us or our competitors;  \n● | changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;  \n● | detrimental adverse publicity about us, our services or our industry;  \n● | announcements of new regulations, rules or policies relevant for our business;  \n● | additions or departures of key personnel;  \n● | release of lockup or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding equity securities or sales of additional equity securities; and  \n● | potential litigation or regulatory investigations.  \n  \nAny of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our ordinary shares will trade.\n\n16\n\nIn the past, shareholders of public companies have often brought securities class action suits against those companies following periods of instability in the market price of their securities. If we were to be involved in a class action suit, it could divert a significant amount of our management’s attention and other resources from our business and operations and require us to incur significant expenses to defend the suit, which could harm our results of operations. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, if a claim is successfully made against us, we may be required to pay significant damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n**_We do not intend to pay dividends on our ordinary shares for the foreseeable future, but if we intend to do so our holding company structure may limit the payment of dividends to our stockholders._**\n\nWhile we have no current intention of paying dividends, should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including as a result of restrictive covenants in loan agreements, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions as discussed below. If future dividends are paid in RMB, fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of RMB into U.S. dollars may reduce the amount received by U.S. stockholders upon conversion of the dividend payment into U.S. dollars.\n\nChinese regulations currently permit the payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. Our subsidiaries in China are also required to set aside a portion of their after tax profits according to Chinese accounting standards and regulations to fund certain reserve funds. Currently, our subsidiaries in China are the only sources of revenues or investment holdings for the payment of dividends. If they do not accumulate sufficient profits under Chinese accounting standards and regulations to first fund certain reserve funds as required by Chinese accounting standards, we will be unable to pay any dividends.\n\n**_We may be subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions and you may have difficulty selling our ordinary shares._**\n\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called “penny stocks” to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. If our ordinary shares becomes a “penny stock”, we may become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the “Penny Stock Rule”. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and “accredited investors” (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market.\n\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our ordinary shares will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our ordinary shares were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\n\n**_If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding the ordinary shares, the market price for the ordinary shares and trading volume could decline._**\n\nThe trading market for our ordinary shares will be influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business. If industry or securities analysts decide to cover us and in the future downgrade our ordinary shares, the market price for our ordinary shares would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price or trading volume for our ordinary shares to decline.\n\n17\n\n**_Techniques employed by short sellers may drive down the market price of our ordinary shares._**\n\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller’s interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a security short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market.\n\nPublic companies that have substantially all of their operations in the PRC have been the subject of short selling. Much of the scrutiny and negative publicity has centered on allegations of a lack of effective internal control over financial reporting resulting in financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result, many of these companies are now conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations and, in the interim, are subject to shareholder lawsuits and/or SEC enforcement actions.\n\nIt is not clear what effect such negative publicity could have on us. If we were to become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we could have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. While we would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller by principles of freedom of speech, applicable law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation could be costly and time-consuming, and could distract our management from growing our business. Even if such allegations are ultimately proven to be groundless, allegations against us could severely impact our business operations, and any investment in our ordinary shares could be greatly reduced or even rendered worthless.\n\n**_We are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to U.S. domestic public companies._**\n\nBecause we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and regulations in the United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including:\n\n● | the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K;  \n---|---  \n● | the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act;  \n● | the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and  \n● | the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.  \n  \nWe are required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we intend to publish our results on a quarterly basis as press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Press releases relating to financial results and material events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information that would be made available to you were you investing in a U.S. domestic issuer.\n\n**_Because we are a foreign private issuer and are exempt from certain Nasdaq corporate governance standards applicable to U.S. issuers, you will have less protection than you would have if we were a domestic issuer._**\n\nNasdaq Listing Rules require listed companies to have, among other things, a majority of its board members be independent. As a foreign private issuer, however, we are permitted to, and we may, follow home country practice in lieu of the above requirements, or we may choose to comply with the Nasdaq requirement within one year of listing. The corporate governance practice in our home country, the Cayman Islands, does not require a majority of our board to consist of independent directors. Since a majority of our board of directors will not consist of independent directors, fewer board members will be exercising independent judgment and the level of board oversight on the management of our company may decrease as a result. In addition, the Nasdaq listing rules also require U.S. domestic issuers to have a compensation committee, a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors, and an audit committee with a minimum of three members. We, as a foreign private issuer, are not subject to these requirements. The Nasdaq listing rules may require shareholder approval for certain corporate matters, such as requiring that shareholders be given the opportunity to vote on all equity compensation plans and material revisions to those plans, certain ordinary share issuances. We intend to comply with the requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rules in determining whether shareholder approval is required on such matters and to appoint a nominating and corporate governance committee. However, we may consider following home country practice in lieu of the requirements under Nasdaq listing rules with respect to certain corporate governance standards which may afford less protection to investors.\n\n18\n\n**ITEM 4.** | **INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY**  \n---|---  \n  \n**History and Development of the Company**\n\nWe are an entertainment and education company which provides online entertainment performances and online music education services via our wholly-owned subsidiary, Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”), education service carried out via our wholly-owned subsidiary CACM Group NY, Inc. (“CACM”) and our joint venture entity, Baytao LLC.\n\nColor Star Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.) was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C-corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, we changed our name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc.\n\nOn August 20, 2018, CACM Group NY, Inc. (“CACM”) was incorporated in the State of New York and is wholly owned by us. The establishment of CACM was to expand the Company’s business in the U.S. CACM has not commenced operations. \n\nOn December 27, 2018, we consummated a re-domicile merger pursuant to which we merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Cayman Islands company and the surviving entity in the merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger adopted in July 2018. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company is now governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nOn July 16, 2019, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of the Company’s memorandum and articles of association which was approved by the Company’s shareholders, the Company’s name was changed from China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. to Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”) and its shareholders. On February 14, 2020, the Company consummated the acquisition of Sunway Kids whereby we issued 1,989,262 ordinary shares and $2 million of cash to be paid in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sunway Kids. The $2 million cash consideration is payable in five installments over five years according to an earn-out schedule. Sunway Kids thereby became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Sunway Kids was established on February 29, 2012, under the laws of the British Virgin Islands as an offshore holding company. On August 23, 2018, Sunway Kids established its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brave Millenium Limited (“Brave Millenium”) under the laws of Hong Kong. On December 4, 2019, Brave Millenium established Chengdu Hengshanghui Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. (“Chengdu Hengshanghui”) in China as a wholly foreign owned limited liability company (the “WFOE”). On December 9, 2019, Chengdu Hengshanghui entered into a series of variable interest entity agreements with Chengdu Hengshanghui Education Consulting Co., Ltd. (“Hengshanghui Education”). Through Sunway Kids and its variable interest entity Hengshanghui Education, we were engaged in providing education and health services to day-care and preschools in China.\n\nOn March 10, 2020, CACM entered into a certain joint venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Baydolphin, Inc., a company organized under the laws of New York (“Baydolphin”). Pursuant to the JV Agreement, CACM and Baydolphin have established a limited liability company under the laws of New York, Baytao LLC (“Baytao”), which will intended to be the 100% owner of one or more operating entities in the U.S. to engage in the business of online and offline after-school education.\n\n19\n\nPrior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, our core business has been the concrete business in China. Our concrete business was negatively affected by the economic cycle and government policies. The concrete industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The entire concrete industry in the PRC’s Beijing area experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years as the Beijing government continues to enforce concrete production reformation and tightened environmental laws from late 2017 to date. The reformation causes great uncertainties for local enterprises in the construction market. Since 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down. Also, the Beijing government ordered the suspension of construction jobsites during winters to reduce air pollution since 2017. The operations of Xin Ao were also severely affected. As a result of the Company’s deteriorating cash position, we defaulted on bank loans and experienced a substantial increase in contingent liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, there was a default on a bank loan of $24,345,129. As of December 31, 2019, Xin Ao is subject to several civil lawsuits for which the Company estimated that it is more than likely to pay judgments in the amount of approximately $6.8 million (including interest and penalties of $1.6 million). During the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were additional estimated claims of approximately $0.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The Company believed it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to turn around the concrete business. As such, the Company had been actively seeking to dispose of the concrete business after the acquisition of Sunway Kids.\n\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company completed the disposition (the “Xin Ao Disposition”) of Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (“BVI-ACM”), after obtaining its shareholders’ approval on April 27, 2020 and satisfaction or waiver of all other closing conditions. Upon the closing of the Xin Ao Disposition, Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He became the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The proceeds of $600,000 from the Xin Ao Disposition have been used for the Company’s working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nOn April 27, 2020, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of its memorandum and articles of association (which was approved by the Company’s shareholders), the Company’s name was changed to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”), a Hong Kong limited company, and shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company shall acquire all of the outstanding issued shares and other equity interests in Color China from the sellers (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Color China, the Company shall issue 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company and pay an aggregate of $2,000,000 to the sellers. The Company plans to make Color China an emerging online performance and online music education provider with a significant collection of performance specific assets -- leveraging professional experience of the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) who has established good relationships with major record companies, renowned artists and entertainment agencies around the world. Immediately after the Acquisition, Color Star will own 100% of Color China. On June 3, 2020, the transaction contemplated by the Exchange Agreement was consummated when the Company issued 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company to the Sellers and the Sellers transferred all of Color China’s issued and outstanding shares to the Company.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the Company and the former shareholders of Sunway Kids entered into an Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment”) to the Share Exchange Agreement dated December 31, 2019, as amended. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company shall not make any Earn-out Payment to the former shareholders of Sunway Kids since Sunway Kids has been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and management of Sunway Kids believes it will be very difficult to achieve its projected financial results. On the same day, Sunway Kids and Yanliang Han (the “Purchaser”), an unrelated third party, entered into certain share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the Purchaser agreed to purchase Sunway Kids for cash consideration of $2.4 million consisting of $400,000 which shall be paid within a month of closing, and $2,000,000 to be paid in monthly installments of $200,000 over 10 months. Upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Disposition SPA on June 25, 2020, the Purchaser became the sole shareholder of Sunway Kids and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by Sunway Kids.\n\nEffective October 1, 2020, the Company changed the ticker symbol of its ordinary shares traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market from “HHT” to “CSCW”, representing the abbreviation of “Color Star Color World.” This is the new focus of the Company’s business.\n\n20\n\n**Organizational structure**\n\nBelow is the Company’s corporate structure chart as of the date of this report.\n\n![](image_001.jpg)\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nWe are an entertainment and education company providing online and offline innovative music education through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Color China and CACM. We strive to offer students professional artist training platform featured by exclusive content and live interaction, with the mission of delivering world-class entertainment learning experiences and promoting entertainment exchange between U.S. and China with our strong resources and deep connections in industry. We launched our online platform Color World on September 10, 2020 and it is currently operating in China. The curriculum development created by us includes music, sports, animation, painting and calligraphy, film and television, life skills, etc., covering plenty of aspects of entertainment, sports and culture. At present, we have signed contracts with well-known international artists and more than 50 celebrity teachers have been retained to launch online lectures. The Color World platform not only has celebrity lectures, but also celebrity concert videos, celebrity peripheral products, such as celebrity branded merchandise, and artist interactive communication. We strive to build an all-star cultural and entertainment industry chain. To establish a new entertainment industry chain combining online and offline, we also plan to establish offline education institutions. The offline education base will train during the day and perform at night to make the training base a commercial operation. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our plan to establish the offline education base has been delayed. The management of the Company will adjust our plan of development in accordance with the development of COVID-19.\n\nThe management believes that we, along with our alliance, have strong industry resources and influence to become a comprehensive online academy for global “future stars”. The Company was formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd., and changed its name to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd. in May 2020. Prior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, the Company’s core business had been focusing on the concrete business in China.\n\n21\n\n**Our Competition**\n\nThe online education market is rapidly expanding and estimated to reach $320 billion by 20254. With the acceleration of online learning due to social distancing, this industry is experiencing huge growth. We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is sensitive to price, content (i.e. curriculum) and quality of service. With online learning adoption accelerating and creating new opportunities, competition is heating up for companies actively competing to capture market share, with the presence of a large number of service and content providers in the market bringing huge volumes of educational content online.\n\nWe face intense competition in our online business and compete primarily with online education providers and content sharing platforms who are already established and who are beginning to target entertainment education, with a trend of “fan culture” and “idol economies” in Asia where talent shows are popular and have launched a large number of amateur stars. We are uniquely positioned, as a comprehensive online and offline entertainment education services provider with all-star teacher lineup, as well as the strong resources and wide connections in industry. Below are a few of our closest competitors below and the unique ways we are differentiated in our view.\n\n●| MasterClass is an American online education platform on which students can access tutorials and lectures pre-recorded by experts in various fields. Unlike us who offer students a professional artists training platform featured by exclusive content and live interaction, MasterClass’ classes are typically not interactive, though at least one course included “interactive assignments” where the student acted with other students, either in person or over Skype. Classes cover topics like writing, sports, and cooking, with 33 artist instructors focused on entertainment and music teaching. MasterClass’ member subscription fee is $15/month, a little more expensive than us.  \n---|---  \n●| LearnWorlds is a stand-alone online course platform for instructors to create, sell and promote their online courses. Users will be charged at least $79 per month to either sell courses or get access to free courses, which means that everyone who is qualified (not just experts and celebrities) could create and sell their courses on the platform. Users are not offered abundant tools for marketing their courses.  \n---|---  \n●| Vimeo is an American video hosting, sharing, and services platform headquartered in New York City. Vimeo operates on an ad-free basis, and instead derives revenue by providing subscription plans for video content producers and offering software as a service (SaaS) with video creation, editing, and broadcasting tools, enterprise software solutions, as well as the means for video professionals to connect with clients and other professionals.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Our Competitive Strengths**\n\nWe differ from various other competitors in our core content of “star online + entertainment teaching” and the combination of online and offline teaching. We are set to break past the boundaries between celebrity entertainment and online knowledge-sharing, and offers students a professional artists training platform featured by exclusive content and live interaction by top artists and celebrities globally, as the first online platform to bring western artists to attract Asian students and meanwhile enabling Asian artists to enter the Western markets. The Company is well connected with artists from Asian to Western, and is able to group many international superstars into its proprietary platform “Color World”. As more international stars join in, coupled with our international version App to be launched in the near future, we expect the Company will continue to expand its subscriber base and gain market share, and bring innovative changes to the current state of music education and entertainment industry. We believe we are as well positioned in the industry with our all-star instructor lineup, excellent combination of online and offline learning, as well as the strong resources and extensive connections, which we believe most competitors lack.\n\n4| Research and Markets.

The continued shift of education from in person to virtual is driving higher demand and significant revenue for market vendors in the industry. We target a large addressable market driven by the rapid expansion of global online education, and the rise of the “fan economies” in Asia where the younger generation is more willing to attend their idol’s livestream and spend money on their idols. Meanwhile, the popularity of talent competition shows in Asia has also inspired more ordinary people to enter the entertainment industry and pursue their dreams of being a star. We as a comprehensive entertainment education services provider, could address the growing demand from both fans and talents, and provide professional entertainment education to more than 2 billion people worldwide; and  \n---|---  \n●| **We are well positioned to capture market share with an experienced management team, all-star instructor lineup, and the combination of online and in-person training.** We strive to offer students professional artists training platform featured by exclusive content and live interaction and are well connected with artists from Asia and U.S., establishing strategic partnerships with top record companies and entertainment agencies.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Our Operations**\n\nWe are growing to become combination of creating the world’s top online and offline celebrity entertainment sharing platform.

The platform focuses on the interactive participation of members and fans, making the platform more entertaining. Fans can interact with their idols, and they can also upload their own works for celebrity tutors and audiences across the network to watch comments. The celebrity live streaming section, which was launched on October 15, 2020, allows more celebrities to communicate and interact with our users through the Internet.\n\nThe Color World platform generates revenue primarily through paid membership subscriptions priced at $9.90 per user per month. Members can access most video courses on the platform for free and will be charged the tuition fee of $30/hour for taking classes of tier 1 artists and $15/hour for learning from Tier 2 artists. First three months of launch costs only $1.5/hour to attract downloads and there have been over 500,000 registered users as of the date of this report.\n\n5| Research and Markets.

Currently, we have entered into educational licensing and performance agreements with approximately over 40 global artists and professionals in industry for their services as instructors on the Color World platform, and are seeking out and contracting more star teachers in a variety of fields such as music, film, sports, animation, television, presentations, dance, and art to provide its prospective student subscribers with a large repertoire of first-hand exposure to and lessons from professionals in their desired fields.\n\n**Online Concert**\n\nThe Company established its own music festival brand “Color International Music Festival” and its CEO has the experiences of holding more than 100 star concerts with its partners every year. On September 9, 2020, we broadcasted the Color World Online Concert with ten Eastern and ten Western top artists/celebrities including Grammy-winning jazz guitarist Larry Carlton, R&B singer-songwriter Ashanti, and “Pop Music Queen” Na Ying from mainland China to global audiences via its official platform “Color World” and attracted over half a million viewers from mainland China and all over the world to watch online, reaching over 10 million hits on global social media networks, which we believe is a milestone to the Company.\n\n**Online Store**\n\nOur Color World App is expected to add an online store feature on October 25, 2020, mainly selling celebrity co-branded peripheral products including clothing, shoes, hats, watches, digital products, wine, and other categories. An increased number of active users can also be expected, as more fans join and use the App, allowing us in a more competitive position to provide complete experience for global users.\n\n**_Offline Business_**\n\n**Music Festival**\n\nWe are currently in discussion with multiple well-established music festival brands to co-organize up to 30 music festivals with different genres over the next five years in different cities across Asia and beyond. The management of the Company will closely monitor the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and adjust our plans of co-organizing the music festivals to protect the safety of our customers and employees and to comply with the applicable laws and regulations.\n\n**Our Customers**\n\nWe had no sales during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 from our continuing operations and we had no accounts receivable as of June 30, 2020. \n\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we had two customers, whose sales accounted for more than 10% of our total sales from discontinued operations. Five customers accounted for approximately 52.1% of the Company’s sales for the year ended June 30, 2019 from discontinued operations. The total accounts receivable from these customers from discontinued operations amounted to approximately $13.4 million as of June 30, 2019. \n\n24\n\n**Sales and Marketing**\n\n**_Marketing Channels_**\n\nWe market our course offerings and enhance brand awareness through various online and mobile channels. We place advertisements and conduct marketing on mainstream social media platforms in China. At the same time, we also generate sales leads from word-of-mouth referrals by our students and parents of students. We believe our high quality course offerings and satisfactory student experience will continue to contribute word-of-mouth referrals.\n\nA unique approach for the online concert promotions was adopted by the Company where ticket prices were initially set very low with additional opportunities for purchasers to take part in the distribution of ticket sales in order to receive referral rewards. This indirect ticket sales model, and a large amount of resulting passive income, promises more diversified marketing strategies for online music.\n\n**Research and Development**\n\n**_Technology and Infrastructure_**\n\nTechnology is the backbone of our highly scalable business model. Our strong technological capabilities enable us to deliver a superior student experience and improve operational efficiency. Our technology team, coupled with our proprietary artificial intelligence technology and the growing volume of data generated from our operations, has continued to identify opportunities for improvements in our technology infrastructure and applications.\n\n**_Live Broadcasting Technology_**\n\nLive broadcasting technology development has been our main focus since our inception. Currently, our proprietary live broadcasting technology makes it possible for as many as 200,000 students to join a live broadcasting class simultaneously, without compromising video quality.\n\n**Intellectual Property**\n\nAs of the date of this report, we have two domain names: www.colorstarinternational.com and www.color-star.cn.\n\n**Our Labor Force**\n\nAs of October 30, 2020, we employed 40 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees. As required by applicable PRC law, we have entered into employment contracts with all our officers, managers and employees. We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees and we have not experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulty in recruiting staff.\n\n25\n\n**Restatement and Independent Investigation**\n\nOn October 6, 2018, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with the Company’s then independent registered public accounting firm, Friedman LLP (“Friedman”) concluded, that the Company’s audited financial statements at and for the period ended June 30, 2017 contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K originally filed with the SEC on September 28, 2018 as well as the unaudited financial statements at and for the periods ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 contained in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q originally filed on November 15, 2017, February 13, 2018 and May 15, 2018, respectively, should no longer be relied upon. The Company’s review of the above mentioned filings revealed that the financial statements in such filings contained errors primarily as a result of omission of certain contingencies.\n\nAs a result of such review, the Company has restated the financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 as well as those for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017.\n\nAs a result of the errors described above, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the ends of each of the applicable restatement periods.\n\nIn connection with above finding, the Audit Committee commenced an independent investigation into the reasons that led to the Company’s conclusion that the previously filed financials should no longer be relied upon. Specially, the Audit Committee engaged an independent investigation team to investigate the circumstances surrounding errors in Company’s financial statements, which primarily resulted from the omission of certain actual and contingent legal liabilities. The investigation concluded in mid-November 2018. The investigation team found several reasons that appear to have caused, or contributed to, the failures to promptly identify and disclose the legal proceedings and contingencies, including, 1) the Head of the Legal Department’s significant lack of understanding of the important of timely disclosure of legal proceedings and the Legal Department’s problematic decision-making process with regard to reporting of legal proceedings; 2) the Company’s lack of accounting personnel trained in U.S. GAAP; 3) the Company’s need for a full-time CFO; 4) the ongoing lack of communication and coordination between executive management and the various departments within the Company; and 5) the Company’s failures to timely address significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has completed its process of conducting a comprehensive review of the issues identified by the investigation team and has taken all remedial measures recommended by the Audit Committee within its resources to cure the majority of its material weaknesses in its internal and disclosure control procedures. \n\nMatters relating to or arising from the Audit Committee investigation and the associated material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting, including adverse publicity, have caused us to incur significant legal, accounting and other professional fees and other costs, have exposed us to greater risks associated with other civil litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions, have diverted resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy and may have impacted our ability to attract and retain customers, employees and vendors.\n\n**Regulations**\n\nThis section sets forth a summary of the most significant rules and regulations that affect our business activities in China.\n\n**_Regulation Related to Value-added Telecommunications Services_**\n\nOn September 25, 2000, the State Council issued the PRC Regulations on Telecommunications, or the Telecommunications Regulations, as last amended on February 6, 2016, to regulate telecommunications activities in China. The Telecommunications Regulations divided the telecommunications services into two categories, namely “infrastructure telecommunications services” and “value-added telecommunications services.” Pursuant to the Telecommunications Regulations, operators of value-added telecommunications services, or VATS, must first obtain a Value-added Telecommunications Business Operating License, or VATS License, from the MIIT, or its provincial level counterparts. On July 3, 2017, the MIIT promulgated the Administrative Measures on Telecommunications Business Operating Licenses, which set forth more specific provisions regarding the types of licenses required to operate VATS, the qualifications and procedures for obtaining such licenses and the administration and supervision of such licenses.\n\n26\n\nThe Amended Classified Catalog of Telecommunications Services (2015 Version), or the Amended 2016 MIIT Catalog, which took effect on June 6, 2019, defines information services as “the information services provided for users through public communications networks or internet by means of information gathering, development, processing and the construction of the information platform.” Moreover, information services continue to be classified as a category of VATS and are clarified to include information release and delivery services, information search and query services, information community platform services, information real-time interactive services, and information protection and processing services under the Amended 2016 MIIT Catalog. The Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services, or ICP Measures, promulgated by the PRC State Council on September 25, 2000 and most recently amended on January 8, 2011, set forth more specific rules on the provision of internet information services. According to ICP Measures, any company that engages in the provision of commercial internet information services shall obtain a sub-category VATS License for Internet Information Services, or ICP License, from the relevant government authorities before providing any commercial internet information services within the PRC. Pursuant to the above-mentioned regulations, “commercial internet information services” generally refer to provision of specific information content, online advertising, web page construction and other online application services through internet for profit making purpose.\n\nIn addition to the Telecommunications Regulations and the other regulations discussed above, the provision of commercial internet information services on mobile internet applications is regulated by the Administrative Provisions on Mobile Internet Applications Information Services, which was promulgated by Cyberspace Administration of China, or the CAC, on June 28, 2016 and came into effect on August 1, 2016. The providers of mobile internet applications are subject to requirements under these provisions, including acquiring the qualifications and complying with other requirements provided by laws and regulations and being responsible for information security.\n\n**_Regulation Related to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs_**\n\nTo regulate the provision of audio-visual program services to the public via the internet, including through mobile networks, within the territory of the PRC, the State Administration of Press Publication Radio Film and Television, or the SAPPRFT (currently known as National Radio and Television Administration), and the MIIT jointly promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Internet Audio-Visual Program Service, or the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, on December 20, 2007, which came into effect on January 31, 2008 and was last amended on August 28, 2015.

In general, providers of online audio-visual program services must be either state-owned or state-controlled entities, and the business to be carried out by such providers must satisfy the overall planning and guidance catalog for internet audio-visual program service determined by the SAPPRFT.\n\nOn May 21, 2008, SAPPRFT issued a Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Application and Approval of License for the Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs, as amended on August 28, 2015, which sets out detailed provisions concerning the application and approval process regarding the License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs. According to the above regulations, providers of internet audio-visual program services that engaged in such services prior to the promulgation of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions are eligible to apply for the license so long as those providers did not violate the relevant laws and regulations in the past or their violation of the laws and regulations is minor in scope and can be rectified in a timely manner and they have no records of violation during the last three months prior to the promulgation of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions.\n\nOn March 30, 2009, SAPPRFT promulgated the Notice on Strengthening the Administration of the Content of Internet Audio-Visual Programs, which reiterates the pre-approval requirements for the audio-visual programs transmitted via the internet, including through mobile networks, where applicable, and prohibits certain types of internet audio-visual programs containing violence, pornography, gambling, terrorism, superstition or other similarly prohibited elements.\n\nOn March 10, 2017, SAPPRFT issued the Provisional Implementation of the Tentative Categories of Internet Audio-Visual Program Services, or the Categories, which revised the previous version issued on March 17, 2010. According to the Categories, there are four categories of internet audio and video programs services which are further divided into seventeen sub-categories. The third sub-category to the second category covers the making and editing of certain specialized audio-visual programs concerning, among other things, educational content, and broadcasting such content to the general public online.\n\nOn March 16, 2018, the SAPPRFT promulgated the Notice on Further Regulating the Transmission Order of Internet Audio-Visual Program Services, providing that the classic literary works, radio, film and television programs, internet original audio-visual programs shall not be re-edited, re-dubbed, re-subtitled or partly captured and consolidated as a new program without authorizations and providers of internet audio-visual program services shall strictly manage and supervise such re-edited programs uploaded by the internet users and shall not provide any transmission channel for those internet audio-visual programs which have political orientation issues, copyright issues or content issues.\n\n27\n\n**_Regulation Related to Internet Live Streaming Services_**\n\nOn September 2, 2016, the SAPPRFT promulgated the Notice on Strengthening the Administration of Live Streaming Services of Internet Audio-Visual Program, which provides that any entity that intends to engage in live audio-visual broadcasting of major political, military, economic, social, cultural or sport events or activities, or live audio-visual broadcasting of general social or cultural group activities, general sporting events or other organizational events, must obtain a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs with a permitted operation scope covering the above business activities. Any entity or individual without qualification is prohibited from broadcasting live audio-visual programs involving news, variety shows, sports, interviews, commentary or other forms of programs through any online live-streaming platform or online live broadcasting booth, nor are they permitted to start a live broadcasting channel for any audio-visual programs. In addition, any entity without such license shall not operate audio-visual live streaming business and the live streaming programs provided by the qualified company shall not contain any content forbidden by laws and regulations.\n\nOn November 4, 2016, the CAC promulgated the Provisions on the Administration of Internet Live Streaming Services, or the Internet Live Streaming Provisions, effective from December 1, 2016. Under the Internet Live Stream Provisions, “internet live streaming service” is defined as the activities of continuously releasing real-time information to the public on internet in such forms as videos, audios, images and texts and the “internet live streaming service provider” is defined thereunder as an operator of the platform providing internet live streaming platform services. The Internet Live Streaming Provisions provide that internet live streaming service providers shall examine and verify the identity information of internet live-streaming issuers and file the identity information of the issuers with local counterparts of the CAC.\n\nOn July 12, 2017, the CAC issued a Notice on Development of the Filing Work for Enterprises Providing Internet Live Streaming Services, which provides that all the companies providing internet live streaming services shall file with the local authority since July 15, 2017, otherwise the CAC or its local counterparts may impose administrative sanctions on such companies.\n\nPursuant to the Circular on Tightening the Administration of Internet Live-Streaming Services jointly issued by the MIIT, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, or the MCOT, and several other government agencies on August 1, 2018, live streaming services providers are required to file with the local public security authority within 30 days after it commences the service online.\n\n**_Regulation Related to Production and Distribution of Radio and Television Programs_**\n\nOn 19 July 2004, SAPPRFT promulgated the Administrative Measures on the Production and Operation of Radio and Television Programs, or the Radio and TV Programs Measures, which became effective on 20 August 2004 and were amended on August 28, 2015 and October 31, 2018. The Radio and TV Programs Measures are applicable for establishing institutions that produce and distribute radio and television programs or for the production of radio and television programs like programs with a special topic, column programs, variety shows, animated cartoons, radio plays and television dramas and for activities like transactions and agency transactions of program copyrights. Pursuant to the Radio and TV Programs Measures, any entity that intends to produce or operate radio or television programs must first obtain the Permit for Production and Operation of Radio and TV Programs from SAPPRFT or its local branches.\n\n28\n\n**_Regulation Related to Internet Culture Activities_**\n\nOn May 10, 2003, the Ministry of Culture, or MOC (currently known as the MCOT), promulgated the Interim Administrative Provisions on Internet Culture, or the Internet Culture Provisions, which became effective on July 1, 2003 and was amended on February 17, 2011 and December 15, 2017. The Internet Culture Provisions require internet information services providers engaging in commercial “internet culture activities” to obtain an Internet Culture Business Operating License from the MOC. “Internet cultural activity” is defined under the Internet Culture Provisions as an act of provision of internet cultural products and related services, which includes (i) the production, duplication, importation, and broadcasting of the internet cultural products; (ii) the online dissemination whereby cultural products are posted on the internet or transmitted via the internet to end-users, such as computers, fixed-line telephones, mobile phones, television sets and games machines, for online users’ browsing, use or downloading; and (iii) the exhibition and competition of the internet cultural products. In addition, “internet cultural products” is defined under the Internet Culture Provisions as cultural products produced, broadcast and disseminated via the internet, which mainly include internet cultural products especially produced for the internet, such as online music entertainment, online games, online shows and plays (programs), online performances, online works of art and online cartoons, and internet cultural products produced from cultural products such as music entertainment, games, shows and plays (programs), performances, works of art, and cartoons through certain techniques and duplicating those to internet for dissemination.\n\nOn May 14, 2019, the General Office of MOC promulgated the Notice on Adjusting the Scope of Internet Culture Business Operating License and Further Standardize the Approval Work, which provides that online music, online shows and plays, online performances, online works of art, online cartoons, displays and games are the activities that fall in the scope of Internet Culture Business Operating License, and further clarifies that educational live streaming activities are not online performances.\n\n**_Regulation Related to Online Publishing_**\n\nOn February 4, 2016, the SAPPRFT (currently reformed into the State Administration of Press and Publication (National Copyright Bureau) under the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China) and the MIIT jointly issued the Administrative Provisions on Online Publishing Services, or the Online Publishing Provisions, which came into effect on March 10, 2016. Under the Online Publishing Provisions, any entity providing online publishing services shall obtain an Online Publishing Services Permit. “Online publishing services” refer to the provision of online publications to the public through information networks; and “online publications” refer to digital works with publishing features such as having been edited, produced or processed and are available to the public through information networks, including: (i) written works, pictures, maps, games, cartoons, audio/video reading materials and other original digital works containing useful knowledge or ideas in the field of literature, art, science or other fields; (ii) digital works of which the content is identical to that of any published book, newspaper, periodical, audio/video product, electronic publication or the like; (iii) network literature databases or other digital works, derived from any of the aforesaid works by selection, arrangement, collection or other means; and (iv) other types of digital works as may be determined by the SAPPRFT.\n\nAs of the date of this annual report, there are no explicit interpretation from the governmental authorities or prevailing enforcement practice deeming the provision of our educational content to our students through our online platform as “online publishing” which requires an Online Publishing Service Permit. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the local PRC authorities would adopt a different practice. In addition, it remains uncertain whether the PRC governmental authorities would issue more explicit interpretation and rules or promulgate new laws and regulations.\n\n29\n\n**_Regulation Related to Internet Information Security and Privacy Protection_**\n\nThe PRC Constitution states that the PRC laws protect the freedom and privacy of communications of citizens and prohibit infringement of such rights. PRC governmental authorities have enacted laws and regulations on internet information security and protection of personal information from any abuse or unauthorized disclosure. The Decisions on Maintaining Internet Security which was enacted by the Standing Committee of the PRC National People’s Congress, or the SCNPC on December 28, 2000 and amended on August 27, 2009, may subject violators to criminal punishment in the PRC for any effort to: (i) gain improper entry into a computer or system of strategic importance; (ii) disseminate politically disruptive information; (iii) leak state secrets; (iv) spread false commercial information; or (v) infringe intellectual property rights. The Ministry of Public Security has promulgated measures that prohibit use of the internet in ways which, among other things, result in a leakage of state secrets or a spread of socially destabilizing content. If an information service provider violates these measures, the Ministry of Public Security and the local security bureaus may revoke its operating license and shut down its websites.\n\nPursuant to the Decision on Strengthening the Protection of Online Information issued by the SCNPC on December 28, 2012, and the Order for the Protection of Telecommunication and Internet User Personal Information issued by the MIIT on July 16, 2013, any collection and use of user personal information must be subject to the consent of the user, abide by the principles of legality, rationality and necessity and be within the specified purposes, methods and scopes. “Personal information” is defined as information that identifies a citizen, the time or location for his/her use of telecommunication and internet services or involves privacy of any citizen such as his/her birth date, ID card number, and address.

These Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP._\n\n**5A. Operating Results**\n\n**Overview**\n\n__Summary of Business__\n\nWe are an entertainment and education company which provides online entertainment performance and online music education services via our wholly-owned subsidiary, Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”). Our core business used to be concrete business. In February 2020, the Company acquired Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”) and consequently shifted its business from concrete business to online education service, targeting preschool children. In May and June 2020, the Company completed the disposition of its former subsidiary, Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (along with its subsidiary and the variable interest entity in China) and Sunway Kids, respectively, and exited the concrete business and preschool children online education service. In June 2020, the Company acquired Color China and thereafter became engaged in the businesses of providing online and offline paid knowledge services for the media, entertainment and culture industries globally. \n\nColor China is an emerging company in the performance support and music education business with a significant collection of music performance specific equipment. The hiring of our management team has extensive experience in large-scale entertainment performance, music equipment leasing and intellectual property (“IP”) licensing. Our newly appointed CEO, Mr. Biao Lu, has unique experience in working with many renowned artists and has established good relationships with major record companies and entertainment agencies around the world. Leveraging its unique resources, Color China was in the process of building an online entertainment and music education platform featuring artists and professional producers as its lead instructors. The online cultural entertainment platform, Color World, was officially launched globally on September 10, 2020. We will be producing and streaming celebrity-taught online lessons and celebrity generated content videos on this platform. The platform will also create a live-streaming and audio community and serve as an e-commerce channel for commercialized celebrity IP products.\n\nCACM collaborates with Baydolphin, Inc. (“Baydolphin”) and together established a joint venture company, Baytao, a limited liability company focusing on the online after-school tutoring program for students in New York. The Company plans to use Baytao as a platform to extend its online education/music education programs. The online after-school tutoring program, Baydolphin Education, is still in the developing stage.\n\n32\n\n__Management’s Plan for the Business__\n\nWe believe that the online entertainment and music education platform built by Color China will bring innovative changes to the current state of music education and entertainment industry, with the goal to eliminate the boundaries of nationality, region, and cultural differences in the entertainment and music areas. Through the Internet, Color China can provide professional entertainment and music education globally. We aim to recruit an All-Star Crew to be coaches on the Color Star program, including top-notch professional vocalists, producers, musicians and more.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and caused massive global health and economic crisis, while also causing large-scale social and behavioral changes in societies. Online entertainment and education are experiencing enormous growth which we believe will last long after the pandemic. We believe that these market conditions have created tremendous opportunities for our business plans, and therefore we expect to focus on the expansion of Color China’s and Baytao’s business in light of their great potential for revenue generation and profitability.\n\n**Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance**\n\nWe believe that the following factors will continue to affect our financial performance:\n\n●| Experienced Management. Management’s technical knowledge and business relationships give us the ability to collaborate with major record companies, entertainment agencies and teaching experts, which provides us with leverage to expand our recognition, promote our products and attract more students rapidly. If there were to be any significant turnover in our senior management, it could deplete the expertise and knowledge held by our existing senior management team.  \n---|---  \n●| Innovation Efforts. We strive to produce the most innovative advanced products to the users of our platforms. We entered into technical service contracts with platform developers and program licensees to further improve our products and to better user experience. If our research and development efforts were not sufficient to adapt to the change in technology in the industries, our products might not compete effectively.  \n---|---  \n  \nResults of Operations\n\nThe tables in the following discussion summarize our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated.\n\n_For the Years Ended June 30, 2020 vs. June 30, 2019_\n\n**For the Years ended**  \n---  \nJune 30,  \nPercentage  \n2020 | 2019 | Change | Change  \nSelling, general and administrative expenses | $| (1,598,984| ) | $| (2,065,829| ) | $| (466,845| ) | (23| )%  \nResearch and development expenses | (120,000| ) | - | 120,000 | 100| %  \nStock compensation expense | (3,444,617| ) | (4,592,200| ) | (1,147,583| ) | (25| )%  \nLoss from operations | (5,163,601| ) | (6,658,029| ) | (1,494,428| ) | (22| )%  \nTotal other expense, net | (5,041| ) | (1,393| ) | 3,648 | 262| %  \nLoss before provision for income taxes | (5,168,642| ) | (6,659,422| ) | (1,490,780| ) | (22| )%  \nProvision for income taxes | - | - | - | -| %  \nNet loss from continuing operations | (5,168,642| ) | (6,659,422| ) | (1,490,780| ) | (22| )%  \nLoss from discontinued operations | (6,457,955| ) | (7,729,108| ) | (1,271,153| ) | (16| )%  \nNet loss | $| (11,626,597| ) | $| (14,388,530| ) | $| (2,761,933| ) | (19| )%  \n  \n33\n\n**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_. **Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of advertising and marketing costs, office rent and expenses, costs associated with staff and support personnel who manage our business activities, and professional fees paid to third parties. We incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to approximately $2.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, a decrease of approximately $0.5 million. The decrease was primarily due to approximately $0.3 million decrease in salary expenses, approximately $0.1 million decrease in audit fees and approximately $0.2 million decrease in repair costs and consulting services. The decrease was offset by approximately $0.1 million increase in legal fees as we performed various acquisitions and disposals during the year ended June 30, 2020.\n\n**_Research and Development Expenses_. **Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with development of our online platforms. We spent approximately $0.1 million on the online after-school tutoring program of Baytao during the year ended June 30, 2020.\n\n**_Stock Compensation Expenses_.** Stock compensation expenses were approximately $3.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to approximately $4.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease was mainly due to lower amortization expenses in 2020 as a result a decline in deferred stock compensation.\n\n**_Loss from Operations._** We incurred a loss from operations of approximately $5.2 million and approximately $6.7 million for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease of approximately $1.5 million was primarily due to the reasons previously discussed.\n\n**_Total Other Expense, Net_.** Our total other expense, net consists of interest income and finance expense. We had total other expense, net of $5,041 and $1,393 during the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase was mainly due to that we had more bank services charges in the year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019.\n\n**_Provision for Income Taxes._** We did not incur income tax expense for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 as we had operating losses.\n\n**_Loss from Continuing Operations_.** Our loss from continuing operations decreased by approximately $1.5 million, or 22%, to loss from continuing operations of approximately $5.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2020 from a loss from continuing operations of approximately $6.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2019.

The decrease in loss from discontinued operations was predominantly due to gain on sale of discontinued operations of approximately $6.6 million as we sold BVI-ACM with significant net deficit to our prior shareholders for cash consideration of $600,000. The closing of the disposition was completed on May 6, 2020. The decrease was mainly offset by increased loss from discontinued operations as Xin Ao, a variable interest entity of BVI-ACM, which considered as a major part of discontinued operations generated less revenues and more bad debt expenses during the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. In addition, the decrease of net loss from discontinue operations also was offset by the loss on sale of Sunway Kids. We acquired Sunway Kids in February 2020. However, due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, the Company was unable to start Sunway Kids’ business and therefore decided to sell Sunway Kids at a loss of approximately $0.8 million to minimize any further losses.\n\n**_Net Loss._** We incurred a net loss of approximately $11.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, as compared to a net loss of approximately $14.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2019.

The increase in loss from discontinued operations was predominantly due to the decrease of gross profit which was driven by the decrease in sales volume and increase of inventory unit price of Xin Ao, our main operation of discontinued operations during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018.\n\n35\n\n**_Net Loss._** We incurred net loss of approximately $14.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, as compared to a net loss of approximately $7.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2018.

Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the Purchasers agreed to purchase BVI-ACM in exchange for cash consideration of $600,000. The closing of the Disposition was completed on May 6, 2020. After disposal of BVI-ACM, the Company had no continuing involvement or commitments with BVI-ACM.\n\n43\n\n_Prepayment – related party_\n\nMr. Xianfu Han, and Mr. Weili He are holding positions as president and director of Ningbo Lianlv Investment Ltd., respectively. This company owns 99% of the shares of Beijing Lianlv Technical Group Ltd. (“Beijing Lianlv”), the Company’s supplier. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s prepayment – related party of discontinued operations amounted to $456,399 and $3,027,409 for Beijing Lianlv, before any allowance, for inventory purchases, respectively.\n\n_Other receivables – related party_\n\nThis balance represents litigation against Xin Ao who entered into a capital lease agreement on behalf of Beijing Lianlv, an entity whose shareholders are Mr. Han and Mr. He. The balance was indemnified by Mr. Han and Mr. He in November 2019. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, other receivable – related party of discontinued operations from Beijing Lianlv was $165,075 and $1,397,042, respectively.\n\n_Other payables – related parties_\n\nThe balances represent the salary payables to Mr. Xianfu Han, Mr. Weili He, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) who collectively held less than 5% of the Company ordinary shares currently.\n\nOther payables – related parties consisted of the following:\n\nJune 30, 2020 | June 30, 2019 | June 30, 2018  \n---|---|---  \nXianfu Han | $| - | $| 361,336 | $| 91,336  \nWeili He | 10,711 | 396,401 | 104,428  \nTotal | 10,711 | 757,737 | 195,763  \nLess: other payables – related parties - discontinued operations | - | (217,737| ) | (195,763| )  \nOther payables – related parties – continuing operations | $| 10,711 | $| 540,000 | $| -  \n  \n_Borrowings from related party_\n\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, Hou Sing, the Company’s shareholder, lent the Company $300,000 to pay for the Company’s certain operating expenses.

Share Capital**\n\nNot Applicable.\n\n**10.B. Memorandum and Articles of Association**\n\nWe are a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability and our affairs are governed by our Memorandum and Articles, the Companies Law, the common law of the Cayman Islands, our corporate governance documents and rules and regulations of the stock exchange on which are shares are traded.\n\n45\n\nAs of the date hereof, the authorized share capital of the Company is $75,000 divided into 75,000,000 Ordinary Shares with a nominal or par value of USD 0.001 each. We have proposed to increase our authorized share capital to 200,000,000 ordinary shares of a par value of US$0.001 each by the creation of an additional 125,000,000 ordinary shares of a par value of US$0.001 each to rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares, which proposal shall be considered and voted by the shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Shareholders to be held on November 18, 2020. As of November 12, 54,861,811 Ordinary Shares are issued and outstanding. All of our issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares are fully paid.\n\n**_Ordinary Shares_**\n\nThe following are summaries of material provisions of our Memorandum and Articles, corporate governance policies and the Companies Law insofar as they relate to the material terms of our Ordinary Shares.\n\n**_Objects of Our Company_**\n\nUnder our Memorandum and Articles, the objects of our Company are unrestricted and we have the full power and authority to carry out any object not prohibited by the law of the Cayman Islands.\n\n**_Share Capital_**\n\nThe holders of our Ordinary Shares are entitled to one vote for each such share held and shall be entitled to notice of any shareholders’ meeting, and, subject to the terms of Memorandum and Articles, to vote thereat.\n\n**_Dividends_**\n\nThe holders of our Ordinary Shares are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by our Board of Directors subject to the Companies Law and to our Memorandum and Articles.\n\n**_Voting Rights_**\n\nIn respect of all matters subject to a shareholders’ vote, each Ordinary Share is entitled to one vote. Voting at any shareholders’ meeting is by show of hands unless a poll is demanded by the chairman or persons holding certain amounts of shares as set forth in the Memorandum and Articles. Actions that may be taken at a general meeting also may be taken by a unanimous resolution of the shareholders in writing.\n\nNo business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of members is present at the time when the meeting proceeds to business; two members present in person or by proxy shall be a quorum provided always that if the Company has one member of record the quorum shall be that one member present in person or by proxy. An ordinary resolution to be passed at a general meeting requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes cast.\n\nA special resolution of members is required to change the name of the Company, approve a merger, wind up the Company, amend the Memorandum and Articles and reduce the share capital.\n\n**_Transfer of Ordinary Shares_**\n\nSubject to the restrictions set out below, any of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his, its or her Ordinary Shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or any other form approved by our Board of Directors or in a form prescribed by the stock exchange on which our shares are then listed.\n\nOur Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, decline to register any transfer of Ordinary Shares whether or not it is fully paid up to the total consideration paid for such shares. Our directors may also decline to register any transfer of Ordinary Shares if (a) the instrument of transfer is not accompanied by the certificate covering the shares to which it relates or any other evidence as our Board of Directors may reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor to, or his/her right to transfer the shares; or (b) the instrument of transfer is in respect of more than one class of shares.\n\n46\n\nIf our directors refuse to register a transfer, they shall, within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to the transferee notice of such refusal.\n\nThe registration of transfers may be suspended and the register closed at such times and for such periods as our Board of Directors may from time to time determine, provided, however, that the registration of transfers shall not be suspended nor the register closed for more than 30 days in any year.\n\n**_Winding-Up/Liquidation_**\n\nOn a return of capital on winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares), a liquidator may be appointed to determine how to distribute the assets among the holders of the Ordinary Shares. If our assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay all of the paid-up capital, the assets will be distributed so that the losses are borne by our shareholders proportionately; a similar basis will be employed if the assets are more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital at the commencement of the winding up.\n\n**_Calls on Ordinary Shares and Forfeiture of Ordinary Shares_**\n\nOur Board of Directors may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their Ordinary Shares in a notice served to such shareholders at least 14 days prior to the specified time and place of payment. The shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid on the specified time are subject to forfeiture.\n\n**_Redemption of Shares_**\n\nWe may issue shares on terms that are subject to redemption, at our option or at the option of the holders, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by our Board of Directors.\n\n**_Inspection of Books and Records_**\n\nDirectors shall from time to time determine whether and to what extent and at what times and places and under what conditions or regulations the accounts and books of the Company or any of them shall be open to the inspection of members not being Directors and no member (not being a Director) shall have any right of inspecting any account or book or document of the Company except as conferred by Companies Law or authorized by the Directors or by the Company in a general meeting. However, the Directors shall from time to time cause to be prepared and to be laid before the Company in a general meeting, profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, group accounts (if any) and such other reports and accounts as may be required by Companies Law. (See “Where You Can Find More Information”)\n\n**_Issuance of Additional Shares_**\n\nOur Memorandum and Articles authorize our Board of Directors to issue additional Ordinary Shares from time to time as our Board of Directors shall determine, to the extent there are available authorized but unissued shares.\n\nOur Memorandum and Articles also authorizes our Board of Directors to establish from time to time one or more series of preferred shares and to determine, subject to compliance with the variation of rights of shares provision in the Memorandum and Articles, with respect to any series of preferred shares, the terms and rights of that series, including:\n\n● | the designation of the series;  \n---|---  \n● | the number of shares of the series;  \n● | the dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights; and  \n● | the rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences.  \n  \n47\n\nOur Board of Directors may, issue preferred shares without action by our shareholders to the extent there are authorized but unissued shares available.\n\n**_Anti-Takeover Provisions_**\n\nSome provisions of our Memorandum and Articles may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company or management that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that:\n\n● | authorize our Board of Directors to issue preferred shares in one or more series and to designate the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such preferred shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders (subject to variation of rights of shares provisions in our Memorandum and Articles); and  \n---|---  \n● | limit the ability of shareholders to requisition and convene general meetings of shareholders. Our Memorandum and Articles allow our shareholders holding shares representing in aggregate not less than twenty percent of our paid up share capital (as to the total consideration paid for such shares) in issue to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders, in which case our directors are obliged to call such meeting and to put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting.  \n  \nHowever, under Cayman Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under our Memorandum and Articles for a proper purpose and for what they believe in good faith to be in the best interests of our Company.\n\n**_General Meetings of Shareholders and Shareholder Proposals_**\n\nOur shareholders’ general meetings may be held in such place within or outside the Cayman Islands as our Board of Directors considers appropriate.\n\nAs a Cayman Islands exempted company, we are not obliged by the Companies Law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings. The directors may, whenever they think fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting.\n\nShareholders’ general meetings and any other general meetings of our shareholders may be convened by a majority of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors shall give not less than seven days’ written notice of a shareholders’ meeting to those persons whose names appear as members in our register of members on the date the notice is given (or on any other date determined by our directors to be the record date for such meeting) and who are entitled to vote at the meeting.\n\nCayman Islands law provides shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting, and does not provide shareholders with any right to put any proposal before a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in a company’s articles of association. Our Memorandum and Articles allow our shareholders holding shares representing in aggregate not less than ten percent of our paid up share capital (as to the total consideration paid for such shares) in issue to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of our shareholders, in which case our directors are obliged to call such meeting and to put the resolutions so requisitioned to a vote at such meeting; otherwise, our Memorandum and Articles do not provide our shareholders with any right to put any proposals before annual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings not called by such shareholders.\n\n**_Exempted Company_**\n\nWe are an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Law. The Companies Law distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. A Cayman Islands exempted company:\n\n● | is a company that conducts its business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands;  \n---|---  \n● | is exempted from certain requirements of the Companies Law, including the filing an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies or the Immigration Board;  \n● | does not have to make its register of members open for inspection;  \n  \n48\n\n● | does not have to hold an annual general meeting;  \n---|---  \n● | may issue negotiable or bearer shares or shares with no par value (subject to the provisions of the Companies Law);  \n● | may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for 20 years in the first instance); and  \n● | may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands.  \n  \n“Limited liability” means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the shareholder on the shares of the company (except in exceptional circumstances, such as involving fraud, the establishment of an agency relationship or an illegal or improper purpose or other circumstances in which a court may be prepared to pierce or lift the corporate veil).\n\n**_Register of Members_**\n\nUnder Cayman Islands law, we must keep a register of members and there should be entered therein:\n\n● | the names and addresses of the members, a statement of the shares held by each member, and of the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid, on the shares of each member;  \n---|---  \n● | the date on which the name of any person was entered on the register as a member; and  \n● | the date on which any person ceased to be a member.  \n  \nUnder Cayman Islands law, the register of members of our Company is prima facie evidence of the matters set out therein (i.e. the register of members will raise a presumption of fact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted) and a member registered in the register of members is deemed as a matter of Cayman Islands law to have legal title to the shares as set against its name in the register of members. Once our register of members has been updated, the shareholders recorded in the register of members are deemed to have legal title to the shares set against their name.\n\nIf the name of any person is incorrectly entered in, or omitted from, our register of members, or if there is any default or unnecessary delay in entering on the register the fact of any person having ceased to be a member of our Company, the person or member aggrieved (or any member of our Company or our Company itself) may apply to the Cayman Islands Grand Court for an order that the register be rectified, and the Court may either refuse such application or it may, if satisfied of the justice of the case, make an order for the rectification of the register.\n\n**_Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability_**\n\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our Memorandum and Articles require us to indemnify our officers and directors for actions, proceedings, claims, losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (“Indemnified Losses”) incurred in their capacities as such unless such Indemnified Losses arise from dishonesty of such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\n\n49\n\n**Material Differences between U.S. Corporate Law and Cayman Islands Corporate Law**\n\nThe Companies Law is modeled after that of English law but does not follow many recent English law statutory enactments. In addition, the Companies Law differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the significant differences between the provisions of the Companies Law applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the State of Delaware.\n\n**_Mergers and Similar Arrangements_**. A merger of two or more constituent companies under Cayman Islands law requires a plan of merger or consolidation to be approved by the directors of each constituent company and authorization by (a) a special resolution of the shareholders and (b) such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company’s articles of association.\n\nA merger between a Cayman Islands parent company and its Cayman Islands subsidiary or subsidiaries does not require authorization by a resolution of shareholders of that Cayman Islands subsidiary if a copy of the plan of merger is given to every member of that Cayman Islands subsidiary to be merged unless that member agrees otherwise. For this purpose a subsidiary is a company of which at least ninety percent (90%) of the issued shares entitled to vote are owned by the parent company.\n\nThe consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest over a constituent company is required unless this requirement is waived by a court in the Cayman Islands.\n\nSave in certain circumstances, a dissentient shareholder of a Cayman constituent company is entitled to payment of the fair value of his shares upon dissenting to a merger or consolidation. The exercise of appraisal rights will preclude the exercise of any other rights save for the right to seek relief on the grounds that the merger or consolidation is void or unlawful.\n\nIn addition, there are statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, provided that the arrangement is approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made, and who must in addition represent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meetings, convened for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not to be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that:\n\n● | the statutory provisions as to the required majority vote have been met;  \n---|---  \n● | the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the statutory majority are acting bona fide without coercion of the minority to promote interests adverse to those of the class;  \n---|---  \n● | the arrangement is such that may be reasonably approved by an intelligent and honest man of that class acting in respect of his interest; and  \n---|---  \n● | the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Law.  \n---|---  \n  \nWhen a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90.0% of the shares within four months, the offeror may, within a two-month period commencing on the expiration of such four month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands but this is unlikely to succeed in the case of an offer which has been so approved unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith or collusion.\n\nIf an arrangement and reconstruction is thus approved, the dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights, which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of Delaware corporations, providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares.\n\n50\n\n**_Shareholders’ Suits._** In principle, we will normally be the proper plaintiff and as a general rule a derivative action may not be brought by a minority shareholder. However, based on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority in the Cayman Islands, there are exceptions to the foregoing principle, including when:\n\n● | a company acts or proposes to act illegally or ultra vires;  \n---|---  \n● | the act complained of, although not ultra vires, could only be effected duly if authorized by more than a simple majority vote that has not been obtained; and  \n---|---  \n● | those who control the company are perpetrating a “fraud on the minority.”  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability_**. Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our current memorandum and articles of association permit indemnification of officers and directors for losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred in their capacities as such unless such losses or damages arise from dishonesty or fraud of such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers that provide such persons with additional indemnification beyond that provided in our current memorandum and articles of association.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\n\n**_Directors’ Fiduciary Duties_** _._ Under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director acts in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He must not use his corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, the director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the transaction was of fair value to the corporation.\n\nAs a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and therefore it is considered that he or she owes the following duties to the company — a duty to act bona fide in the best interests of the company, a duty not to make a profit based on his or her position as director (unless the company permits him or her to do so) and a duty not to put himself or herself in a position where the interests of the company conflict with his or her personal interest or his or her duty to a third party. A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his or her duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his or her knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands.\n\n**_Shareholder Action by Written Consent_**. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may eliminate the right of shareholders to act by written consent by amendment to its certificate of incorporation. Cayman Islands law and our current articles of association provide that shareholders may approve corporate matters by way of a unanimous written resolution signed by or on behalf of each shareholder who would have been entitled to vote on such matter at a general meeting without a meeting being held.\n\n51\n\n**_Shareholder Proposals_**. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal before the annual meeting of shareholders, provided it complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized to do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings.\n\nCayman Islands law does not provide shareholders any right to put proposals before a meeting or requisition a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in articles of association. Our current articles of association allow our shareholders holding not less than one-third of all voting power of our share capital in issue to requisition a shareholder’s meeting. Other than this right to requisition a shareholders’ meeting, our current articles of association do not provide our shareholders other right to put proposal before a meeting. As a Cayman Islands exempted company, we are not obliged by law to call shareholders’ annual general meetings.\n\n**_Cumulative Voting._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation’s certificate of incorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since it permits the minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder’s voting power with respect to electing such director. There are no prohibitions in relation to cumulative voting under the laws of the Cayman Islands but our current articles of association do not provide for cumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation.\n\n**_Removal of Directors._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of a corporation with a classified board may be removed only for cause with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under our current articles of association, directors may be removed with or without cause, by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders.\n\n**_Transactions with Interested Shareholders._** The Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware corporations whereby, unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation, it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an “interested shareholder” for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder generally is a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target’s outstanding voting share within the past three years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target’s board of directors.\n\nCayman Islands law has no comparable statute. As a result, we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the Delaware business combination statute. However, although Cayman Islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders, it does provide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and not with the effect of constituting a fraud on the minority shareholders.\n\n**_Dissolution; Winding up._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution must be approved by shareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation’s outstanding shares. Delaware law allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board. Under Cayman Islands law, a company may be wound up by either an order of the courts of the Cayman Islands or by a special resolution of its members or, if the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, by an ordinary resolution of its members. The court has authority to order winding up in a number of specified circumstances including where it is, in the opinion of the court, just and equitable to do so. Under the Companies Law and our current articles of association, our company may be dissolved, liquidated or wound up by a special resolution of our shareholders.\n\n52\n\n**_Variation of Rights of Shares._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation may vary the rights of a class of shares with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of such class, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Under Cayman Islands law and our current articles of association, if our share capital is divided into more than one class of shares, we may vary the rights attached to any class with the written consent of the holders of three-fourths of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a resolution passed by not less than three-fourths of such holders of the shares of that class as may be present at a general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.\n\n**_Amendment of Governing Documents._** Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a corporation’s governing documents may be amended with the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. As permitted by Cayman Islands law, our current memorandum and articles of association may only be amended with a special resolution of our shareholders.\n\n**_Rights of Non-resident or Foreign Shareholders._** There are no limitations imposed by our post-offering amended and restated memorandum and articles of association on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on our shares. In addition, there are no provisions in our current memorandum and articles of association governing the ownership threshold above which shareholder ownership must be disclosed.\n\n**10.C. Material Contracts**\n\nWe have not entered into any material contracts other than in the ordinary course of business and other than those described in this annual report. \n\n**10.D. Exchange Controls**\n\n**_Cayman Islands_**\n\nThere are currently no exchange control regulations in the Cayman Islands applicable to us or our shareholders.\n\n**_The PRC_**\n\nChina regulates foreign currency exchanges primarily through the following rules and regulations:\n\n● | Foreign Currency Administration Rules of 1996, as amended; and  \n---|---  \n● | Administrative Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange of 1996.  \n---|---  \n  \nRenminbi is not a freely convertible currency at present. Under the current PRC regulations, conversion of Renminbi is permitted in China for routine current-account foreign exchange transactions, including trade and service related foreign exchange transactions, payment of dividends and service of foreign debts. Conversion of Renminbi for most capital-account items, such as direct investments, investments in PRC securities markets and repatriation of investments, however, is still subject to the approval of SAFE.\n\nPursuant to the above-mentioned administrative rules, foreign-invested enterprises may buy, sell and/or remit foreign currencies for current account transactions at banks in China with authority to conduct foreign exchange business by complying with certain procedural requirements, such as presentment of valid commercial documents. For capital-account transactions involving foreign direct investment, foreign debts and outbound investment in securities and derivatives, approval from SAFE is a pre-condition. Capital investments by foreign-invested enterprises outside China are subject to limitations and requirements in China, such as prior approvals from the PRC Ministry of Commerce or SAFE.\n\n**10.E. Taxation**\n\nThe following summary of the material Cayman Islands, PRC and U.S. tax consequences of an investment in our ordinary shares is based upon laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary is not intended to be, nor should it be construed as, legal or tax advice and is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. This summary also does not deal with all possible tax consequences relating to an investment in our ordinary shares, such as the tax consequences under state, local, non-U.S., non-PRC, and non-Cayman Islands tax laws. Investors should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares.\n\n53\n\n_Cayman Islands Taxation_\n\nThe Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands that are likely to be material to holders of ordinary shares or ordinary shares. The Cayman Islands is not party to any double tax treaties. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands.\n\n_People’s Republic of China Taxation_\n\nUnder the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside the PRC with a “de facto management body” within the PRC is considered a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and is generally subject to a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on its worldwide income as well as tax reporting obligations. Under the Implementation Rules, a “de facto management body” is defined as a body that has material and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and properties of an enterprise. In addition, SAT Circular 82 issued in April 2009 specifies that certain offshore-incorporated enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups will be classified as PRC resident enterprises if all of the following conditions are met: (a) senior management personnel and core management departments in charge of the daily operations of the enterprises have their presence mainly in the PRC; (b) their financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in the PRC; (c) major assets, accounting books and company seals of the enterprises, and minutes and files of their board’s and shareholders’ meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (d) half or more of the enterprises’ directors or senior management personnel with voting rights habitually reside in the PRC. Further to SAT Circular 82, the SAT issued SAT Bulletin 45, which took effect in September 2011, to provide more guidance on the implementation of SAT Circular 82. SAT Bulletin 45 provides for procedures and administration details of determination on PRC resident enterprise status and administration on post-determination matters. If the PRC tax authorities determine that Color Star Technology Co., Ltd. is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. For example, Color China may be subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% with respect to its worldwide taxable income. Also, a 10% withholding tax would be imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC enterprise shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC enterprise shareholders from transferring our shares or ordinary shares and potentially a 20% of withholding tax would be imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC individual shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC individual shareholders from transferring our shares or ordinary shares.\n\nIt is unclear whether, if we are considered a PRC resident enterprise, holders of our shares or ordinary shares would be able to claim the benefit of income tax treaties or agreements entered into between China and other countries or areas. See “Risk Factors — Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in China —If we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC income tax purposes, such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders”.\n\nThe SAT issued SAT Circular 59 together with the Ministry of Finance in April 2009 and SAT Circular 698 in December 2009. Both SAT Circular 59 and SAT Circular 698 became effective retroactively as of January 1, 2008. By promulgating and implementing these two circulars, the PRC tax authorities have enhanced their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise by a non-PRC resident enterprise. Under SAT Circular 698, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of a PRC resident enterprise indirectly by disposition of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, and the overseas holding company is located in a tax jurisdiction that: (1) has an effective tax rate of less than 12.5% or (2) does not impose tax on foreign income of its residents, the non-PRC resident enterprise, being the transferor, must report to the relevant tax authority of the PRC resident enterprise this Indirect Transfer. Using a “substance over form” principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of up to 10%. Although it appears that SAT Circular 698 was not intended to apply to share transfers of publicly traded companies, there is uncertainty as to the application of SAT Circular 698 and we and our non-PRC resident investors may be at risk of being required to file a return and being taxed under SAT Circular 698 and we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with SAT Circular 698 or to establish that we should not be taxed under SAT Circular 698.\n\n54\n\nPursuant to the Arrangement between the Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income, or the Tax Arrangement, where a Hong Kong resident enterprise which is considered a non-PRC tax resident enterprise directly holds at least 25% of a PRC enterprise, the withholding tax rate in respect of the payment of dividends by such PRC enterprise to such Hong Kong resident enterprise is reduced to 5% from a standard rate of 10%, subject to approval of the PRC local tax authority. Pursuant to the Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on the Issues concerning the Application of the Dividend Clauses of Tax Agreements, or Circular 81, a resident enterprise of the counter-party to such Tax Arrangement should meet the following conditions, among others, in order to enjoy the reduced withholding tax under the Tax Arrangement: (i) it must directly own the required percentage of equity interests and voting rights in such PRC resident enterprise; and (ii) it should directly own such percentage in the PRC resident enterprise anytime in the 12 months prior to receiving the dividends. Furthermore, the Administrative Measures for Non-Resident Enterprises to Enjoy Treatments under Tax Treaties (For Trial Implementation), or the Administrative Measures, which became effective in October 2009, requires that the non-resident enterprises must obtain the approval from the relevant tax authority in order to enjoy the reduced withholding tax rate under the tax treaties. There are also other conditions for enjoying such reduced withholding tax rate according to other relevant tax rules and regulations. According to Circular 81, if the relevant tax authorities consider the transactions or arrangements we have are for the primary purpose of enjoying a favorable tax treatment, the relevant tax authorities may adjust the favorable withholding tax in the future.\n\n_United States Federal Income Taxation_\n\nThe following is a discussion of United States federal income tax considerations relating to the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of our ordinary shares by a U.S. Holder, as defined below, that acquires our ordinary shares and holds our ordinary shares as “capital assets” (generally, property held for investment) under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). This discussion is based upon existing United States federal income tax law, which is subject to differing interpretations or change, possibly with retroactive effect. No ruling has been sought from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any United States federal income tax consequences described below, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. This discussion does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxation that may be important to particular investors in light of their individual circumstances, including investors subject to special tax rules (such as, for example, certain financial institutions, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment, partnerships and their partners, tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations)), investors who are not U.S. Holders, investors that own (directly, indirectly, or constructively) 10% or more of our voting stock, investors that hold their ordinary shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale or other integrated transaction), or investors that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those summarized below. In addition, this discussion does not address any tax laws other than the United States federal income tax laws, including any state, local, alternative minimum tax or non-United States tax considerations, or the Medicare tax. Each potential investor is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the United States federal, state, local and non-United States income and other tax considerations of an investment in our ordinary shares.\n\n**_General_**\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares that is, for United States federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created in, or organized under the laws of, the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is includible in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust (A) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a United States court and which has one or more United States persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (B) that has otherwise elected to be treated as a United States person under the Code.\n\n55\n\nIf a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and partners of a partnership holding our ordinary shares are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding an investment in our ordinary shares.\n\nThe discussion set forth below is addressed only to U.S. Holders that purchase ordinary shares. Prospective purchasers are urged to consult their own tax advisors about the application of the U.S. federal income tax rules to their particular circumstances as well as the state, local, foreign and other tax consequences to them of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares.\n\n**_Taxation of Dividends and Other Distributions on our Ordinary Shares_**\n\nSubject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below, the gross amount of distributions made by us to you with respect to the ordinary shares (including the amount of any taxes withheld therefrom) will generally be includable in your gross income as dividend income on the date of receipt by you, but only to the extent that the distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). With respect to corporate U.S. Holders, the dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction allowed to corporations in respect of dividends received from other U.S. corporations.\n\nWith respect to non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individual U.S. Holders, dividends will be taxed at the lower capital gains rate applicable to qualified dividend income, provided that (1) the ordinary shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States, or we are eligible for the benefits of an approved qualifying income tax treaty with the United States that includes an exchange of information program, (2) we are not a passive foreign investment company (as discussed below) for either our taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year, and (3) certain holding period requirements are met. Because there is no income tax treaty between the United States and the Cayman Islands, clause (1) above can be satisfied only if the ordinary shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. Under U.S. Internal Revenue Service authority, ordinary shares are considered for purpose of clause (1) above to be readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States if they are listed on Nasdaq. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the lower rate for dividends paid with respect to our ordinary shares, including the effects of any change in law after the date of this report.\n\nTo the extent that the amount of the distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles), it will be treated first as a tax-free return of your tax basis in your ordinary shares, and to the extent the amount of the distribution exceeds your tax basis, the excess will be taxed as capital gain. We do not intend to calculate our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles. Therefore, a U.S. Holder should expect that a distribution will be treated as a dividend even if that distribution would otherwise be treated as a non-taxable return of capital or as capital gain under the rules described above.\n\n**_Taxation of Dispositions of Ordinary Shares_**\n\nSubject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below, you will recognize taxable gain or loss on any sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of a share equal to the difference between the amount realized (in U.S. dollars) for the share and your tax basis (in U.S. dollars) in the ordinary shares. The gain or loss will be capital gain or loss. If you are a non-corporate U.S. Holder, including an individual U.S. Holder, who has held the ordinary shares for more than one year, you may be eligible for reduced tax rates on any such capital gains. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\n**_Passive Foreign Investment Company_**\n\nA non-U.S. corporation is considered a PFIC for any taxable year if either:\n\n● | at least 75% of its gross income for such taxable year is passive income; or  \n---|---  \n● | at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets during a taxable year) is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income (the “asset test”).  \n---|---  \n  \n56\n\nPassive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of passive assets. We will be treated as owning our proportionate share of the assets and earning our proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which we own, directly or indirectly, at least 25% (by value) of the stock. In determining the value and composition of our assets for purposes of the PFIC asset test, (1) the cash we hold will generally be considered to be held for the production of passive income and (2) the value of our assets must be determined based on the market value of our ordinary shares from time to time, which could cause the value of our non-passive assets to be less than 50% of the value of all of our assets (including the cash raised in any offering) on any particular quarterly testing date for purposes of the asset test.\n\nWe must make a separate determination each year as to whether we are a PFIC. Depending on the amount of cash we hold, together with any other assets held for the production of passive income, it is possible that, for our 2018 taxable year or for any subsequent taxable year, more than 50% of our assets may be assets held for the production of passive income. We will make this determination following the end of any particular tax year. Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat our consolidated affiliated entities, as being owned by us for United States federal income tax purposes, not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of such entities but also because we are entitled to substantially all of their economic benefits, and, as a result, we consolidate their operating results in our consolidated financial statements. In particular, because the value of our assets for purposes of the asset test will generally be determined based on the market price of our ordinary shares and because cash is generally considered to be an asset held for the production of passive income, our PFIC status will depend in large part on the market price of our ordinary shares and the amount of cash we hold. Accordingly, fluctuations in the market price of the ordinary shares may cause us to become a PFIC. In addition, the application of the PFIC rules is subject to uncertainty in several respects. We are under no obligation to take steps to reduce the risk of our being classified as a PFIC, and as stated above, the determination of the value of our assets will depend upon material facts (including the market price of our ordinary shares from time to time that may not be within our control. If we are a PFIC for any year during which you hold ordinary shares, we will continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which you hold ordinary shares. However, if we cease to be a PFIC and you did not previously make a timely “mark-to-market” election as described below, you may avoid some of the adverse effects of the PFIC regime by making a “purging election” (as described below) with respect to the ordinary shares.\n\nIf we are a PFIC for your taxable year(s) during which you hold ordinary shares, you will be subject to special tax rules with respect to any “excess distribution” that you receive and any gain you realize from a sale or other disposition (including a pledge) of the ordinary shares, unless you make a “mark-to-market” election as discussed below. Distributions you receive in a taxable year that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions you received during the shorter of the three preceding taxable years or your holding period for the ordinary shares will be treated as an excess distribution. Under these special tax rules:\n\n●| the excess distribution or gain will be allocated ratably over your holding period for the ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n●| the amount allocated to your current taxable year, and any amount allocated to any of your taxable year(s) prior to the first taxable year in which we were a PFIC, will be treated as ordinary income, and  \n---|---  \n●| the amount allocated to each of your other taxable year(s) will be subject to the highest tax rate in effect for that year and the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the resulting tax attributable to each such year.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe tax liability for amounts allocated to years prior to the year of disposition or “excess distribution” cannot be offset by any net operating losses for such years, and gains (but not losses) realized on the sale of the ordinary shares cannot be treated as capital, even if you hold the ordinary shares as capital assets.\n\n57\n\nA U.S. Holder of “marketable stock” (as defined below) in a PFIC may make a mark-to-market election for such stock to elect out of the tax treatment discussed above. If you make a mark-to-market election for first taxable year which you hold (or are deemed to hold) ordinary shares and for which we are determined to be a PFIC, you will include in your income each year an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the ordinary shares as of the close of such taxable year over your adjusted basis in such ordinary shares, which excess will be treated as ordinary income and not capital gain. You are allowed an ordinary loss for the excess, if any, of the adjusted basis of the ordinary shares over their fair market value as of the close of the taxable year. However, such ordinary loss is allowable only to the extent of any net mark-to-market gains on the ordinary shares included in your income for prior taxable years. Amounts included in your income under a mark-to-market election, as well as gain on the actual sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares, are treated as ordinary income. Ordinary loss treatment also applies to any loss realized on the actual sale or disposition of the ordinary shares, to the extent that the amount of such loss does not exceed the net mark-to-market gains previously included for such ordinary shares. Your basis in the ordinary shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts. If you make a valid mark-to-market election, the tax rules that apply to distributions by corporations which are not PFICs would apply to distributions by us, except that the lower applicable capital gains rate for qualified dividend income discussed above under “— Taxation of Dividends and Other Distributions on our ordinary shares” generally would not apply.\n\nThe mark-to-market election is available only for “marketable stock”, which is stock that is traded in other than de minimis quantities on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter (“regularly traded”) on a qualified exchange or other market (as defined in applicable U.S. Treasury regulations), including Nasdaq. If the ordinary shares are regularly traded on Nasdaq and if you are a holder of ordinary shares, the mark-to-market election would be available to you were we to be or become a PFIC.\n\nAlternatively, a U.S. Holder of stock in a PFIC may make a “qualified electing fund” election with respect to such PFIC to elect out of the tax treatment discussed above. A U.S. Holder who makes a valid qualified electing fund election with respect to a PFIC will generally include in gross income for a taxable year such holder’s pro rata share of the corporation’s earnings and profits for the taxable year. However, the qualified electing fund election is available only if such PFIC provides such U.S. Holder with certain information regarding its earnings and profits as required under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. We do not currently intend to prepare or provide the information that would enable you to make a qualified electing fund election. If you hold ordinary shares in any taxable year in which we are a PFIC, you will be required to file U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 8621 in each such year and provide certain annual information regarding such ordinary shares, including regarding distributions received on the ordinary shares and any gain realized on the disposition of the ordinary shares.\n\nIf you do not make a timely “mark-to-market” election (as described above), and if we were a PFIC at any time during the period you hold our ordinary shares, then such ordinary shares will continue to be treated as stock of a PFIC with respect to you even if we cease to be a PFIC in a future year, unless you make a “purging election” for the year we cease to be a PFIC. A “purging election” creates a deemed sale of such ordinary shares at their fair market value on the last day of the last year in which we are treated as a PFIC. The gain recognized by the purging election will be subject to the special tax and interest charge rules treating the gain as an excess distribution, as described above. As a result of the purging election, you will have a new basis (equal to the fair market value of the ordinary shares on the last day of the last year in which we are treated as a PFIC) and holding period (which new holding period will begin the day after such last day) in your ordinary shares for tax purposes.\n\nYou are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to your investment in our ordinary shares and the elections discussed above.\n\n**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**\n\nDividend payments with respect to our ordinary shares and proceeds from the sale, exchange or redemption of our ordinary shares may be subject to information reporting to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and possible U.S. backup withholding at a current rate of 24%. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a U.S. Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and makes any other required certification on U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. U.S. Holders who are required to establish their exempt status generally must provide such certification on U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the U.S. information reporting and backup withholding rules.\n\n58\n\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability, and you may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and furnishing any required information. We do not intend to withhold taxes for individual shareholders. However, transactions effected through certain brokers or other intermediaries may be subject to withholding taxes (including backup withholding), and such brokers or intermediaries may be required by law to withhold such taxes.\n\nUnder the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act of 2010, certain U.S. Holders are required to report information relating to our ordinary shares, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for ordinary shares held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions), by attaching a complete Internal Revenue Service Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets, with their tax return for each year in which they hold ordinary shares.\n\n**10.F. Dividends and Paying Agents**\n\nNot Applicable.\n\n**10.G. Statement by Experts**\n\nNot Applicable.\n\n**10.H. Documents on Display**\n\nThe Company is subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will file reports, registration statements and other information with the SEC.

The re-domicile involved the Company’s merger with a newly formed subsidiary, as a result of which we became a wholly owned subsidiary of a Cayman Islands holding company (“CADC Cayman”). Each outstanding share of common stock of the Company was converted into the right to receive one ordinary share of CADC Cayman, which was issued by CADC Cayman in connection with the merger pursuant to a registered offering. There were no material modifications to the rights of our shareholders during the year ended June 30, 2020.\n\n**ITEM 15.** | **CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES**  \n---|---  \n(a)| _Disclosure Controls and Procedures_  \n---|---  \n  \nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act.\n\nBased on that evaluation, we concluded that as of June 30, 2020, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. \n\n(b)| _Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting_  \n---|---  \n  \nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements or external purposes in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020. The assessment was based on criteria established in the framework Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of June 30, 2020, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting due to the existence of the following significant deficiencies and material weaknesses: \n\n●| The personnel primarily responsible for the preparation of our financial statements do not have requisite levels of knowledge, experience and training in the application of U.S. GAAP commensurate with our financial reporting requirements;  \n---|---  \n●| Ineffective supervision of the Company’s internal and disclosure controls over financial reporting;  \n---|---  \n  \n60\n\nManagement is in the process of re-assessing the design of certain control activities and developing its remediation plan for the above identified weaknesses. The Company’s actions are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as Audit Committee oversight. The Company has implemented or will implement following remedial measures within its resources as soon as practicable:\n\n●| Establishing an internal audit function or engage an external consulting firm, to assist with assessment of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance requirements and improvement of overall internal controls;  \n---|---  \n(c)| _Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm_  \n---|---  \n  \nNot applicable.\n\n(d)| _Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_  \n---|---  \n  \nThe management is committed to improving the internal controls over financial reporting and will undertake consistent improvements or enhancements on an ongoing basis. Except as described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\n**ITEM 16.** | **RESERVED**  \n---|---  \n**ITEM 16A.** | **AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT**  \n---|---  \n  \nOur audit committee consists of Xiaoyuan Zhang, Yingxian Xiang and Hung-Jen Kuo. Our board of directors has determined Xiaoyuan Zhang, Yingxian Xiang and Hung-Jen Kuo are “independent directors” within the meaning of NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 5605(a)(2) and meet the criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A−3(b) of the Exchange Act. Xiaoyuan Zhang meets the criteria of an audit committee financial expert as set forth under the applicable rules of the SEC.\n\n**ITEM 16B.** | **CODE OF ETHICS**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Board has adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics that applies to the Company’s directors, officers and employees.

(the “Company”, “we”, or “us”) of its resignation as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. On October 11, 2018, the Board of Directors accepted such resignation. The auditor’s report of Friedman on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.\n\nOn October 6, 2018, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, after consultation with the Company’s then independent registered public accounting firm, Friedman LLP (“Friedman”) concluded, that the Company’s audited financial statements at and for the year ended June 30, 2017 contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K originally filed with the SEC on as well the unaudited financial statements at and for the periods ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 contained in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q originally filed on November 15, 2017, February 13, 2018 and May 15, 2018, respectively, should no longer be relied upon.\n\nDuring the two most recent fiscal years and through the subsequent interim period preceding Friedman’s resignation, there were no (i) “disagreements” (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) between the Company and Friedman on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Friedman would have caused Friedman to make reference to the subject matter thereof in its reports for such fiscal years and interim periods, or (ii) “reportable events” as that term is described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.\n\nWe furnished a copy of this disclosure to Friedman and have requested that Friedman furnish us with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) stating whether such firm agrees with the above statements or, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. We have received the requested letter from Friedman, and a copy of their letter is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 16, 2018 in our Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 16.1.\n\n62\n\n_(b) Engagement of New Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm_\n\nOn October 13, 2018, the Board of Directors approved the engagement of Wei, Wei & Co., LLP (“WWC”) as the Company’s new independent registered public accounting firm.\n\nDuring the two most recent fiscal years and through the subsequent interim period preceding WWC’s engagement, the Company has not consulted with WWC regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company’s financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to the Company nor oral advice was provided that WWC concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue, or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). \n\n**ITEM 16G.** | **CORPORATE GOVERNANCE**  \n---|---  \n  \nOther than as described in this section, our corporate governance practices do not differ from those followed by domestic companies listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635 generally provides that shareholder approval is required of U.S. domestic companies listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market prior to issuance (or potential issuance) of securities (i) equaling 20% or more of the company’s common stock or voting power for less than the greater of market or book value (ii) resulting in a change of control of the company; and (iii) which is being issued pursuant to a stock option or purchase plan to be established or materially amended or other equity compensation arrangement made or materially amended. Notwithstanding this general requirement, NASDAQ Listing Rule 5615(a)(3)(A) permits foreign private issuers to follow their home country practice rather than these shareholder approval requirements. The Cayman Islands do not require shareholder approval prior to any of the foregoing types of issuances. The Company, therefore, is not required to obtain such shareholder approval prior to entering into a transaction with the potential to issue securities as described above. The Board of Directors of the Company has elected to follow the Company’s home country rules as to such issuances and will not be required to seek shareholder approval prior to entering into such a transaction. \n\n**ITEM 16H.** | **MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE**  \n---|---  \n  \nNot applicable.\n\n63\n\n**PART III**\n\n**ITEM 17.** | **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**  \n---|---  \n  \nWe have elected to

(formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.) and Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. **Basis for Opinion** These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Wei, Wei & Co.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n**Note 1 – Organization and description of business**\n\nColor Star Technology Co., Ltd. (the “Company” or “Color Star”) is an entertainment and education company which provides online entertainment performances and online music education services via its wholly-owned subsidiary, Color China Entertainment Limited (“Color China”).\n\nThe Company (formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.) was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C-corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, TJS Wood Flooring, Inc. changed its name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. (“CADC Delaware”). On August 1, 2013, CADC Delaware consummated a reincorporation merger with its newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. (“CADC Nevada”), a Nevada corporation, with CADC Delaware merging into CADC Nevada and CADC Nevada being the surviving company, for the purpose of changing CADC Delaware’s state of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada. On December 27, 2018, CADC Nevada was merged with and into China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. (“CADC Cayman”), a Cayman Islands corporation, whereupon the separate existence of CADC Nevada ceased and CADC Cayman continued as the surviving entity. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company is governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nOn July 16, 2019, CADC Cayman changed its name from “China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc.” to “Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.” On April 27, 2020, Huitao Technology Co., Ltd. changed its name to “Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.”\n\n_CACM Group NY, Inc._\n\nOn August 20, 2018, CACM Group NY, Inc. (“CACM”) was incorporated in the State of New York and is 100% owned by the Company. As of the date of this report, CACM has not commenced any business operations and the Company is currently using CACM as its headquarters in the United States of America.\n\n_Baytao LLC (“Baytao”)_\n\nOn March 10, 2020, CACM entered into a joint venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Baydolphin, Inc. (“Baydolphin”), a company organized under the laws of New York. Pursuant to the JV Agreement,\n\n●| CACM and Baydolphin established a limited liability company under the laws of New York, Baytao, which will be the 100% owner of one or more operating entities in the U.S. to engage in the business of online and offline after-school education.  \n---|---  \n●| The business of Baytao shall be managed by the Board of Managers of Baytao.  \n---|---  \n●| CACM shall appoint three designees to the Board of Managers of Baytao and Baydolphin shall appoint two designees.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n_Color China_\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and caused massive global health and economic crisis, while also causing large-scale social and behavioral changes in societies. Online entertainment and online education are experiencing enormous growth which the Company believes will last long after the pandemic. In order to expand the Company’s global reach and to enter into an online business, on May 7, 2020, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with Color China, a Hong Kong limited company, and shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company acquired all of the outstanding issued shares in Color China from the sellers (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Color China, the Company agreed to issue 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company and pay an aggregate of $2,000,000 to the Sellers. On June 3, 2020, the Acquisition was consummated and the Company issued 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company to the Sellers and closed on the same date. Since Color China had no business operations other than holding a significant collection of music performance specific equipment, the transaction has been treated as an acquisition of assets, as it did not meet the definition of a business. The Company plans to make Color China an emerging online performance and online music education provider with a significant collection of performance specific assets -- leveraging professional experience of the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) who has established good relationships with major record companies, renowned artists and entertainment agencies around the world. Color China is in the process of building an online entertainment and music education platform featuring artists and professional producers as its lead instructors. Color China officially launched its online cultural entertainment platform, Color World, globally on September 10, 2020.\n\n_Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”)_\n\nSunway Kids is an education and health service provider to day-care and preschools in China. Sunway Kids has a highly skilled professional team experienced in early childhood development. It provides a well-structured system for early childhood education, including artificial intelligence and robotic technologies, intellectual campus administration software as a service system (“SAAS system”) and online education courses for kids and parents. With the introduction of the national two-child policy in China since 2015, birth rate in China has been increasing and thus provides an increase in service opportunities for the preschool education industry. With the deepening of China’s economic reforms, the disposable income of urban residents has continued to increase. With the improvement of living standards of urban residents, families are more willing to invest in education, training, and other services for their children starting at a young age.\n\nIn order to expand the Company’s revenue capacity, on December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Share Exchange Agreement”) with Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”), a British Virgin Islands company, and the shareholders of Sunway Kids (the “Sellers of SK”), pursuant to which the Company will acquire all of the outstanding issued shares of Sunway Kids (the “SK Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Sunway Kids, the Company will issue 1,989,262 ordinary shares of the Company and pay two million U.S. dollars. On February 11, 2020, the Company, Sunway Kids and the Sellers of SK entered into an Amendment No. 1 (“Amendment 1”) to the Share Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to Amendment 1, the cash consideration will be payable to the Sellers of SK according to an earn-out schedule. On February 14, 2020, the SK Acquisition was closed and the Company issued 1,989,262 ordinary shares to the Sellers of SK. The shares had a fair value of approximately $1.9 million based on the closing market price of $0.95 per share on February, 14, 2020, the acquisition date. The total consideration was valued at approximately $3.6 million, which include approximately $1.7 million based upon a 5.8% discount rate of the $2.0 million earn-out payment schedule, and approximately $1.9 million for the shares issued.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the Company and the former shareholders of Sunway Kids entered into an Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment 2”) to the Share Exchange Agreement dated December 31, 2019. Pursuant to Amendment 2, the Company shall not make any the earn-out payment to the former shareholders of Sunway Kids since Sunway Kids has been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and management of Sunway Kids believes it will be very difficult to achieve its projected financial results. On the same day, Sunway Kids and Yanliang Han (the “SK Purchaser”), an unrelated third party, entered into certain share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the SK Purchaser agreed to purchase Sunway Kids for cash consideration of $2.4 million consisting of $400,000 which shall be paid within a month of closing, and $2,000,000 to be paid in monthly installments of $200,000 over 10 months. On June 25, 2020, the transaction closed and as a result, the SK Purchaser acquired Sunway Kids and all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled them. Sunway Kids had no operations from February 14, 2020 to June 25, 2020 as management had been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The SK Purchaser subsequently settled $1.0 million of the total $2.4 million payment obligation. Although the SK Purchaser is current with its installment payment, the Company will recognize the installment payment on a cash basis as collectability of the remaining $1.4 million cannot be reasonably assured. The disposition of Sunway Kids resulted in the recognition of a loss of approximately $0.8 million that is recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the caption of “loss from discontinued operations.” The disposition of Sunway Kids was classified as a discontinued operation because it represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company’s operation on artificial intelligence education for preschool kids and financial results in accordance with ASC 205-20-45.\n\nF-8\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n_BVI-ACM_\n\nPrior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, the Company’s core business had been the concrete business in China. The Company had a wholly-owned subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands, Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (“BVI-ACM”), which was a holding company with no operations. BVI-ACM had a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary, Beijing Ao Hang Construction Material Technology Co., Ltd. (“China-ACMH”), and China-ACMH had contractual agreements with Beijing XinAo Concrete Group (“Xin Ao”) and therefore Xin Ao was considered a variable interest entity of China-ACMH. The Company, through BVI-ACM and its variable interest entities (“VIEs”), was engaged in producing general ready-mix concrete, customized mechanical refining concrete, and other concrete-related products that are only sold in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”). The Company’s concrete business was negatively affected by the economic cycle and government policies. The concrete industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The entire concrete industry in the PRC’s Beijing area experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years as the Beijing government continues to enforce concrete production reformation and tightened environmental laws from late 2017 to date. The reformation causes great uncertainties for local enterprises in the construction market. Since 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down. Also, the Beijing government ordered the suspension of construction job sites during winters to reduce air pollution since 2017. The operations of Xin Ao were also severely affected. As a result of Xin Ao’s deteriorating cash position, it defaulted on bank loans and experienced a substantial increase in contingent liabilities. The Company believed it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to turn around the concrete business. As such, the Company had been actively seeking to dispose of the concrete business after the acquisition of Sunway Kids.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company, BVI-ACM, and Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He (the “XA Purchasers”) who collectively held less than 5% ordinary shares of the Company currently), entered into a share purchase agreement (the “XA Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the XA Disposition SPA, the XA Purchasers agreed to purchase BVI-ACM for cash consideration of $600,000. Upon the closing of the transaction (the “XA Disposition”) contemplated by the XA Disposition SPA, the XA Purchasers will become the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and assume all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and VIE entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The closing of the XA Disposition was subject to certain closing conditions including the payment of the $600,000, the receipt of a fairness opinion from ViewTrade Securities Inc. and the approval of the Company’s shareholders. On May 6, 2020, the Company completed the disposition of BVI-ACM after obtaining its shareholders’ approval on April 27, 2020 and satisfaction or waiver of all other closing conditions. Upon the closing of the XA Disposition, the XA Purchases became the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The assets and liabilities and the results of operations of BVI-ACM had been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The disposal of BVI-ACM resulted in a gain of approximately $6.6 million that is recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) under the caption of “loss from discontinued operations”.\n\n**Note 2 – Summary of significant accounting policies**\n\n_Liquidity_\n\nIn assessing the Company’s liquidity, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash on-hand and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Company’s liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. As of June 30, 2020, the Company’s working capital was approximately $2.6 million with cash on-hand of approximately $1.0 million.\n\nSubsequent to June 30, 2020, the Company completed a series of equity financing transactions follows:\n\n●| On July 20, 2020, the Company sold 3,225,000 ordinary shares at the offering price of $1.30 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $4.2 million.  \n---|---  \n●| In August and September 2020, the Company’s Warrant holders converted a total of 5,227,274 warrants into a total of 5,227,274 ordinary shares at a weighted exercise price of $0.11 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $0.6 million.  \n---|---  \n● | On September 8, 2020, the Company sold 793,651 ordinary shares at the offering price of $0.63 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $0.5 million. The Company also agreed to issue 31,746 ordinary shares as additional consideration for the purchase of these shares.  \n---|---  \n●| On September 15, 2020, the Company issued and sold 13,200,000 ordinary shares at the offering price of $0.50 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $6.6 million.  \n---|---  \n● | Sales from July 1, 2020 to the date of this report of approximately $2.0 million.  \n---|---  \n  \nF-9\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nSubsequent to June 30, 2020, the Company has entered into a number of contractual and business arrangements as follows::\n\n●| On August 21, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with a non-affiliated third party (“Asset Seller”) pursuant to which the Company purchased certain machinery and equipment for stage performance for a total purchase price of $6,818,000, of which $3,000,000 shall be paid in cash and the remaining $3,818,000 shall be paid in the form of 6,060,318 ordinary shares. $2,000,000 of the cash consideration was paid in August 2020 and the remaining $1,000,000 was settled in November 2020 through a tri-party settlement agreement executed on September 29, 2020 among the Company, SK Purchaser and the Asset Seller.  \n---|---  \n● | Payments of approximately $2.1 million to the online concert agent and performing artists for the Company’s “Color World Online Concert” held on September 10, 2020.  \n---|---  \n● | Payments of approximately $3.8 million to the star agent and participating celebrities for contracting those celebrities to teach on Color World app.  \n---|---  \n● | Payments of approximately $1.4 million for capital expenditure and other generated and administrative expenses.  \n---|---  \n  \nAs a result of the aforementioned transactions, the Company’s management is of the opinion that it has sufficient funds to meet the Company’s working capital requirements and contractual commitments and related obligations as they become due starting from one year from the date of this report.\n\n_Basis of presentation_\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all the directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and VIEs listed below.\n\n_Principles of consolidation_\n\nThe consolidated financial statements reflect the activities of the following subsidiaries and VIEs. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nSubsidiaries and VIEs | Place incorporated | Ownership percentage  \n---|---|---  \nCACM | New York, USA | 100| %  \nBaytao | New York, USA | 80| %  \nColor China | Hong Kong | 100| %  \nBVI-ACM(1) | British Virgin Island | 100| %  \nChina-ACMH(1) | Beijing, China | 100| %  \nXin Ao(1) | Beijing, China | VIE  \nSunway Kids(2) | British Virgin Island | 100| %  \n(1)| The Company sold BVI-ACM and its subsidiaries to two former officers (CEO and CFO) who collectively held less than 5% ordinary shares of the Company currently for $600,000. See Note 4 – Discontinued operations for details.  \n---|---  \n(2)| The Company sold Sunway Kids and its subsidiaries to a third party for $2.4 million in June 2020. See Note 4 – Discontinued operations for details.  \n---|---  \n  \nF-10\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n_Use of estimates and assumptions_\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The significant estimates and assumptions made in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts of other receivables, prepayments and advances and deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation, and fair value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Actual results could be materially different from those estimates. \n\n_Foreign currency translation_\n\nThe reporting currency of the Company, CACM, Baytao, and Color China is the U.S. dollar (“US$”). The functional currency of BVI-ACM is the U.S. dollar. China-ACMH and Xin Ao use their local currency, the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”) as their functional currency. In accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance on Foreign Currency Translation, the Company’s results of discontinued operations and cash flows are translated at the average exchange rates during the period, assets and liabilities of discontinued operations are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date, and equity is translated at historical exchange rates.\n\nAsset and liability accounts of discontinued operations at May 6, 2020 and June 30, 2019 were translated at RMB 7.06 and RMB 6.87 to US$1.00. Equity accounts are translated at their historical rate. The average translation rates applied to the consolidated statements of discontinued operations and comprehensive loss and cash flows from July 1, 2019 to May 6, 2020 and for the year ended June 30, 2019 were RMB 7.02 and RMB 6.83 to US$1.00, respectively.\n\nTranslation gains (losses) that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations. There were no foreign currency transaction gains or losses for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n\n_Discontinued operations_\n\nIn accordance with ASU No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results when the components of an entity meet the criteria in paragraph 205-20-45-1E to be classified as discontinued operations. When all of the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations are met, including management having the authority to approve the action and committing to a plan to sell the entity or the components, the major current assets, other assets, current liabilities, and noncurrent liabilities shall be reported as components of total assets and liabilities separate from the balances of the continuing operations. At the same time, the results of discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes (benefit), shall be reported as components of net income (loss) separate from the net income (loss) of continuing operations in accordance with ASC 205-20-45. See Note 4 – Discontinued operations.\n\n_Revenue recognition_\n\nOn July 1, 2018, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were not completed as of July 1, 2018. The core principle underlying this ASU is that the Company recognizes its revenue to represent the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in such exchange. This requires the Company to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time, based on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer. The Company’s revenue streams are primarily recognized at a point in time, principally upon music performance performed or education services provided.\n\nThe ASU requires the use of a five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that the Company (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation. The application of the five-step model to the revenue streams compared to the prior guidance did not result in significant changes in the way the Company records its revenue. Upon adoption, the Company evaluated its revenue recognition policy for all revenue streams within the scope of the ASU under previous standards and using the five-step model under the new guidance and confirmed that there were no material differences in the pattern of revenue recognition.\n\nF-11\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe Company accounts for a contract with a customer when the contract is committed in writing, the rights of the parties, including payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration to collect is substantially probable.\n\nWith the acquisition of Color China, the Company plans to offer the following services:\n\n(a)| Online education academy  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company plans to earn revenue from its customers for subscription and tuition fees in connection with online courses to be instructed by individuals with extensive experience in the entertainment and/or music industries.\n\n(b)| Online concert  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company holds online concerts with its star partners. Sale of online concert via subscription fee is accounted for as a single performance obligation which is satisfied at a point in time on the day of the event. Online concert subscription fees are generally collected in advance and are initially recorded as deferred revenue. All ticket sales are final upon payment.\n\n(c)| Online store  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company plans to hold an online marketplace for merchants to sell celebrity licensed or cobranded merchandise such as fashions, cosmetics, souvenirs, among others. The Company plans to charge commission fees to e-commerce merchants for selling in the Company’s online marketplace platform when the sales transaction is completed. The Company serves as an agent and its performance obligation is to arrange for the provision of the specified goods by those e-commerce merchants, and is not responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, and it does not have the ability to control the related shipping services. Upon completion of the sales transaction, the Company will charge the e-commerce merchants a fixed rate commission fee based on the sales amount. Commission fee revenues are recognized on a net basis at the point of delivery of products, net of a return allowance, if applicable.\n\nFor the year ended June 30, 2020, the Company did not earn any revenues from the aforementioned services. \n\nAs a practical expedient, the Company elects to record the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.\n\n_Financial instruments_\n\nUS GAAP specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques for determining the fair value of financial instruments and related fair value measurements based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs). The valuation hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. In accordance with FASB ASC 820, the following summarizes the fair value hierarchy:\n\nThe three levels of inputs are defined as follows:\n\nLevel 1 | inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;  \n---|---  \nLevel 2 | inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument;  \n---|---  \nLevel 3 | inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable.  \n---|---  \n  \nFinancial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at face value or cost, which approximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rates of interest.\n\nF-12\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n_Cash and cash equivalents_\n\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\n_Other receivables_\n\nOther receivables primarily include security deposit and receivable from the disposal of its discontinued operation. Management regularly reviews the age of these receivables and changes in payment trends and will record an allowance for uncollectible when management believes collection of amounts due is at risk. Accounts considered uncollectible are written off against the allowance after exhaustive efforts at collection are made.\n\n_Prepayments and advances_\n\nPrepayments include funds deposited or advanced to outside vendors for future performance obligations, program license fees, vehicle purchase and service fees. As a standard practice in the music performance industry, many of the Company’s vendors require a certain amount to be deposited with them as a guarantee that the Company will complete its purchases on a timely basis. The Company has legally binding contracts with its vendors, the prepayments will be used to offset performance fees, program license fees, purchase price or service fees, and the amounts are refundable and bear no interest if outside vendors breach the contracts.\n\n_Property, plant and equipment_\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost or at fair value of the identifiable assets acquired on the acquisition date less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of each class of depreciable assets and is computed using the straight-line method with 0%-5% residual value.\n\nThe estimated useful lives of assets are as follows: \n\nUseful life  \n---  \nPerformance equipment | 10 years  \nOffice equipment | 5 years  \n  \n_Accounting for long-lived assets_\n\nThe Company classifies its long-lived assets into: (i) performance equipment; and (ii) office equipment.\n\nLong-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technological or other industry changes. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.\n\nIf the value of an asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less disposition costs.\n\nThere were no impairment charges for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\nCompetitive pricing pressures and changes in interest rates could materially and adversely affect the Company’s estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by the long-lived assets, and thus could result in future impairment losses.\n\nF-13\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n_Leases_\n\nEffective July 1, 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU 2016-02, “Leases” (Topic 842), and elected the practical expedients that does not require us to reassess: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are, or contain, leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (3) initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases. For lease terms of twelve months or fewer, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and liabilities. The Company also adopted the practical expedient that allows lessees to treat the lease and non-lease components of a lease as a single lease component.\n\nOperating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the adoption date of July 1, 2019 or the commencement date, whichever is earlier, based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since the implicit rate for the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company use its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, an amount equal to the lease payments, in a similar economic environment and over a similar term.\n\nLease terms used to calculate the present value of lease payments generally do not include any options to extend, renew, or terminate the lease, as the Company does not have reasonable certainty at lease inception that these options will be exercised. The Company generally considers the economic life of its operating lease ROU assets to be comparable to the useful life of similar owned assets. The Company has elected the short-term lease exception, therefore operating lease ROU assets and liabilities do not include leases with a lease term of twelve months or less. Its leases generally do not provide a residual guarantee. The operating lease ROU asset also excludes lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet as operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.\n\nThe Company reviews the impairment of its ROU assets consistent with the approach applied for its other long-lived assets. The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on its ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows of the related operations. The Company has elected to include the carrying amount of operating lease liabilities in any tested asset group and include the associated operating lease payments in the undiscounted future pre-tax cash flows.\n\n_Stock-based compensation_\n\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for employees at fair value on the grant date and recognizes the expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The Company’s expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The expected life assumption is primarily based on historical exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of an option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s current and expected dividend policy.\n\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for non-employees at fair value on the grant date and recognizes the expense over the service provider’s requisite service period.\n\n_Income taxes_\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires the Company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Under this accounting standard, the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\n\nF-14\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nASC 740-10, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” defines uncertainty in income taxes and the evaluation of a tax position as a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of that position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met. Penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the period incurred. United States federal, state and local income tax returns for year 2018 and 2019 are subject to examination by any applicable tax authorities. PRC tax returns filed for calendar years ended December 31, 2017 to 2019 are subject to examination by the applicable tax authorities.\n\n_Earnings (loss) per share_\n\nThe Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires presentation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share in conjunction with the disclosure of the methodology used in computing such earnings per share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts, such as warrants, options, restricted stock based grants and convertible preferred stock, to issue ordinary shares were exercised and converted into ordinary shares. Ordinary share equivalents having an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.\n\nDilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase ordinary shares at the average market price during the period. When the Company has a loss, no potential dilutive items are included since they would be antidilutive.\n\nStock dividends or stock splits are accounted for retroactively if the stock dividends or stock splits occur during the period, or retroactively if the stock dividends or stock splits occur after the end of the period but before the release of the financial statements, by considering it effective as of the beginning of the earliest period presented.\n\n_Comprehensive income (loss)_\n\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\n_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The amendments in this Update affect any entity that is required to apply the provisions of Topic 220, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income, and has items of other comprehensive income for which the related tax effects are presented in other comprehensive income as required by GAAP. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments in this Update is permitted, including adoption in any interim period, (1) for public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued and (2) for all other entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. The amendments in this Update should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recognized. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07 – Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees, which nonemployee share-based payment awards within the scope of Topic 718 are measured at grant-date fair value of the equity instruments that an entity is obligated to issue when the goods have been delivered or the service has been rendered and any other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments have been satisfied. The definition of the term grant date is amended to generally state the date at which a grantor and a grantee reach a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of a share based payment award. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nF-15\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement” (“ASU 2018-13”). ASU 2018-13 removes, modifies and adds certain disclosure requirements in Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurement”. ASU 2018-13 eliminates certain disclosures related to transfers and the valuations process, modifies disclosures for investments that are valued based on net asset value, clarifies the measurement uncertainty disclosure, and requires additional disclosures for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, which is an update to ASU Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduced the expected credit losses methodology for the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis, replacing the previous incurred loss methodology. The amendments in Update 2016-13 added Topic 326, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses, and made several consequential amendments to the Codification. Update 2016-13 also modified the accounting for available-for-sale debt securities, which must be individually assessed for credit losses when fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, in accordance with Subtopic 326-30, Financial Instruments— Credit Losses—Available-for-Sale Debt Securities. The amendments in this Update address those stakeholders’ concerns by providing an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option for certain financial assets previously measured at amortized cost basis. For those entities, the targeted transition relief will increase comparability of financial statement information by providing an option to align measurement methodologies for similar financial assets. Furthermore, the targeted transition relief also may reduce the costs for some entities to comply with the amendments in Update 2016-13 while still providing financial statement users with decision-useful information. ASU 2019-05 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2023 as the Company is qualified as a smaller reporting company. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2019-05 may have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01 to clarify the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under ASC 321 and investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting in ASC 323 and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under ASC 815. With respect to the interactions between ASC 321 and ASC 323, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting when applying the measurement alternative in ASC 321, immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method of accounting. With respect to forward contracts or purchased options to purchase securities, the amendments clarify that when applying the guidance in ASC 815-10-15-141(a), an entity should not consider whether upon the settlement of the forward contract or exercise of the purchased option, individually or with existing investments, the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method in ASC 323 or the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825. The ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Company does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\n__Reclassifications__\n\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year of discontinued operations presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on the accompanying statements of operations and cash flows.\n\n**Note 3 – Business Combinations**\n\n_Acquisition of Sunway Kids_\n\nIn order to expand the Company’s revenue capacity, on December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Share Exchange Agreement”) with Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”), a British Virgin Islands company, and the shareholders of Sunway Kids (the “Sellers of SK”), pursuant to which the Company will acquire all of the outstanding issued shares of Sunway Kids (the “SK Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Sunway Kids, the Company will issue 1,989,262 ordinary shares of the Company and pay two million U.S. dollars. On February 11, 2020, the Company, Sunway Kids and the Sellers of SK entered into an Amendment No. 1 (“Amendment 1”) to the Share Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to Amendment 1, the cash consideration will be payable to the Sellers of SK according to an earn-out schedule. On February 14, 2020, the SK Acquisition was closed and the Company issued 1,989,262 ordinary shares to the Sellers of SK. The shares had a fair value of approximately $1.9 million based on the closing market price of $0.95 per share on February, 14, 2020, the acquisition date. The total consideration was valued at approximately $3.6 million, which include approximately $1.7 million based upon a 5.8% discount rate of the $2.0 million earn-out payment schedule, and approximately $1.9 million for the shares issued. On June 25, 2020, Color Star, Sunway Kids, and the former shareholders of Sunway Kids entered into an Amendment No. 2 (“Amendment”) to the Share Exchange Agreement dated December 31, 2019, as amended. Pursuant to the Amendment 2, the Company shall not make any the Earn-out Payment to the former shareholders of Sunway Kids since Sunway Kids has been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and management of Sunway Kids believes it will be very difficult to achieve its projected financial results.\n\nF-16\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n(FORMERLY KNOWN AS HUITAO TECHNOLOGY, INC.)\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe Company’s acquisition of Sunway Kids was originally intended to be accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805. Due to the negative impact of COVID-19, the Company disposed of Sunway Kids (see Note 4) within the same fiscal year as Sunway Kids was unable to conduct its normal operations and achieve it business plan. In addition, due to COVID-19, the Company was unable to complete its purchase price allocation and assessment on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date in accordance with the business combination standard issued by the FASB, prior to its disposal on June 25, 2020.\n\n_Acquisition of Color China_\n\nOn May 7, 2020, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) with Color China, a Hong Kong limited company, and shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the outstanding issued shares of Color China from the sellers (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company will issue 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company and pay an aggregate of $2 million to the Sellers. Immediately after the Acquisition, Color Star will own 100% of Color China. On June 3, 2020, the transaction was closed and the Company issued 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company to the Sellers. Color China had no business operations other than holding a collection of music performance equipment.\n\nThe Company’s acquisition of Color China was accounted for as an acquisition of assets in accordance with ASC 805. The measurement is based on the fair value of the consideration given to acquire the assets (primarily performance and office equipment) held in Color China as it is more clearly evident and more reliably measurable. The total consideration given to acquire assets held in Color China at the acquisition date on June 3, 2020 were valued at approximately $4 million, consisted of 4,633,333 ordinary shares issued at a fair value of $1,963,607 based on the closing market price of $0.4238 per share on June 3, 2020, and cash payment of $2 million.\n\n**Note 4 – Discontinued Operations**\n\n_Disposal of BVI-ACM_\n\nThe Company’s concrete business was negatively affected by the economic cycle and government policies. The concrete industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The entire concrete industry in the Beijing area experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years as the Beijing government continues to enforce concrete production reformation and tightened environmental laws from late 2017 to date. The reformation causes great uncertainties for local enterprises in the construction market. Since 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down. Also, the Beijing government ordered the suspension of construction job sites during winters to reduce air pollution since 2017. The operations of Xin Ao were also severely affected. As a result of Xin Ao’s deteriorating cash position, it defaulted on bank loans and experienced a substantial increase in contingent liabilities. The Company believed it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to turn around the concrete business. Accordingly, the Company’s management decided to dispose of this business by actively seeking a purchaser after the acquisition of Sunway Kids.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company, BVI-ACM, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He (the “Purchasers”), two former officers (CEO and CFO) and collectively held less than 5% ordinary shares of the Company currently, entered into a share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the Purchasers agreed to purchase BVI-ACM in exchange for cash consideration of $600,000. Upon the closing of the transaction (the “Disposition”) the Purchasers assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and VIE entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The closing of the Disposition was completed on May 6, 2020. After disposal of BVI-ACM, the Company had no continuing involvement or commitments with BVI-ACM.\n\nF-17\n\nCOLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.

Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the SK Purchaser agreed to purchase Sunway Kids in exchange for cash consideration of $2.4 million. Upon closing of the transaction, the SK Purchaser became the sole shareholder of Sunway Kids and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities (the “VIE”) owned or controlled by Sunway Kids. The SK Purchaser settled $1.0 million of its payment obligation in November 2020 through a tri-party settlement agreement executed on September 29, 2020 among the Company, SK Purchaser and the Asset Seller. Although the SK Purchaser is current with its installment payment, the Company will recognize the remaining installment payment on a cash basis as collectability of the remaining $1.4 million cannot be reasonably assured. The disposition of Sunway Kids resulted in the recognition of a loss of approximately $0.8 million that is recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the caption of “loss from discontinued operations.”\n\nThe reconciliation of loss on sale of discontinued operations of Sunway Kids are as follows:\n\nJune 25, 2020 (unaudited)  \n---  \nTotal consideration paid | $| 3,583,952  \nForgiven of fair value of earn out payment | (1,694,153| )  \nExpenses incurred from February 14 to June 25, 2020 | (54,729| )  \nTotal consideration received | (1,000,000| )  \nTotal loss on sale of discontinued operations | $| 835,070  \n  \n_Revenue recognition by Sunway Kids_\n\nWhile owned by the Company, Sunway Kids was in the business of delivering artificial intelligence lessons for kids and it earned tuition fees in connection with lessons completed. Each lesson would be accounted for as a single performance obligation and tuition revenue would be recognized proportionately as the lessons are delivered. Tuition fees were generally collected in advance and would be initially recorded as deferred revenue.

US GAAP requires that the Company’s leases be evaluated and classified as operating or finance leases for financial reporting purposes. The classification evaluation begins at the commencement date and the lease term used in the evaluation includes the non-cancellable period for which the Company has the right to use the underlying asset, together with renewal option periods when the exercise of the renewal option is reasonably certain and failure to exercise such option which result in an economic penalty. All of the Company’s real estate leases are classified as operating leases.\n\nThe Company has a lease agreement for office space in New York from June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2021, with annual payments of $46,896.

The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The leases generally do not contain options to extend at the time of expiration.\n\n**Note 11 – Income taxes**\n\n**(a)** | **Corporate income tax**  \n---|---  \n  \n_Color Star_\n\nUnder the current laws of the Cayman Islands, Color Star is not subject to tax on income or capital gains. Additionally, upon payments of dividends to the shareholders, no Cayman Islands withholding tax will be imposed.\n\n_CACM and Baytao_\n\nCACM and Baytao are organized in the New York State in the United States. CACM and Baytao had no taxable income for the U.S. income tax purposes for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. The applicable tax rate is 21.0% for federal and 7.1% for New York State with an effective tax rate of 26.6%.\n\n_Color China_\n\nColor China is organized in Hong Kong and is subject to Hong Kong Profits Tax on the taxable income as reported in its statutory financial statements adjusted in accordance with relevant Hong Kong tax laws.

Management believes that the realization of the benefits from these losses appears uncertain due to the Company’s operating history and continued losses in the U.S. If the Company is unable to generate taxable income in its United States operations, it is more likely than not that it will not have sufficient income to utilize its deferred tax assets. Accordingly, the Company has provided a 100% valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets of approximately $134,000 and $50,000 related to its U.S. operations as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nChanges in the value allowance for deferred tax assets increased by $84,259 from $50,256 at June 30, 2019 to $134,515 at June 30, 2020.\n\n**(b)** | **Uncertain tax positions**  \n---|---  \n  \nThere were no uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, management does not anticipate any potential future adjustments which would result in a material change to its tax positions.

In June 2020, the Company acquired Color China Entertainment Limited, a Hong Kong limited company and thereafter became engaged in the businesses of providing online and offline paid knowledge services for the media, entertainment and culture industries globally. We expect significant change in results of operations for the last fiscal year.

(the “Company”) received a letter from The NASDAQ Stock Exchange regarding the Company’s failure to comply with NASDAQ Continued Listing Rule (“Rule”) 5550(a)(2), which requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share. A failure to comply with Rule 5550(a)(2) exists when listed securities fail to maintain a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days (including, in particular, the period September 3, 2020 through October 15, 2020), the Company failed to meet the aforesaid requirement.\n\nUnder Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company will be provided a compliance period of 180 calendar days, until April 14, 2021, to regain compliance. If at any time during this 180 day period the closing bid price of the Company’s securities is at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, the Company’s compliance will be regained.\n\nIn the event the Company does not regain compliance in the first compliance period, it may be eligible to apply for an additional 180 calendar days to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement. The Company will also need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period. However, if it appears to the NASDAQ staff that the Company will neither be able nor otherwise eligible to cure the deficiency, it may be subject to delisting by NASDAQ.\n\nThis report on Form 6-K is filed to satisfy the obligation under Rule 5810(b) that the Company publicly disclose the deficiency within four (4) business days after the date of the deficiency letter.\n\n1\n\n**SIGNATURES**\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\n\nDated: October 21, 2020\n\n**COLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.**  \n---  \nBy: | /s/ Biao (Luke) Lu  \nName:  | Biao (Luke) Lu  \nTitle: | Chief Executive Officer   \n  \n2\n"

(the “**Company** ”) and certain institutional investors (the “**Purchasers** ”) entered into that certain securities purchase agreement (the “**Purchase Agreement** ”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to such Purchasers an aggregate of 13,200,000 ordinary shares (the “**Shares** ”), par value $0.001 per share (the “**Ordinary Shares** ”) in a registered direct offering and warrants (the “**Warrants,** ” each, a “**Warrant** ”) to purchase up to 11,880,000 Ordinary Shares in a concurrent private placement, for gross proceeds of approximately $6.6 million (the “**Offering** ”).\n\nThe Warrants will be exercisable immediately upon the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $0.55. The Warrants will expire 5.5 years from the date of issuance. The purchase price for each Share and the corresponding warrant is $0.50. Each Warrant is subject to anti-dilution provisions to reflect stock dividends and splits or other similar transactions. The Warrants contain a mandatory exercise right for the Company to force a cash exercise of the Warrants if the Ordinary Shares trade at or above 400% of the purchase price per Share in the Offering (or $2.00) for 20 consecutive trading days.\n\nPursuant to the Purchase Agreement, from the date of the Purchase Agreement until forty-five (45) days after the closing of the Offering, the Company and its subsidiaries shall not issue any Ordinary Shares or the equivalents or file any registration statement, or amendment or supplement thereto, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “**Commission** ”), other than the prospectus supplement related to the Offering. Such restriction does not apply to certain exempt issuances as described in the Purchase Agreement, including the issuances of (i) Ordinary Shares or options pursuant a properly adopted employee stock option plan of the Company, (ii) securities issued as a result of the exercise of the convertible securities of the Company that are outstanding on the date of the Purchase Agreement, (iii) restricted Ordinary Shares issued in connection with a private placement of up to a maximum of $5 million in gross proceeds to no more than four (4) non-U.S. persons, which such private placement is subject to certain other conditions and restrictions.\n\nThe Company also agreed in the Purchase Agreement that it would file with the Commission a registration statement on Form F-1 (or such other form as the Company is then eligible to use) as soon as practicable (and in any event within 45 calendar days of the closing of the Offering) providing for the resale by the Purchasers of the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, and that it would use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective within 181 days following the closing of the Offering.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, from the date of the Purchase Agreement until such time as no Purchaser holds any of the Warrants issued in the concurrent private placement, the Company shall be prohibited from effecting or entering into an agreement to effect any issuance by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of ordinary shares or ordinary share equivalents involving a Variable Rate Transaction, which means a transaction in which the Company (i) issues or sells any debt or equity securities that are convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or include the right to receive additional ordinary shares either (A) at a conversion price, exercise price or exchange rate or other price that is based upon and/or varies with the trading prices of or quotations for the ordinary shares at any time after the initial issuance of such debt or equity securities, or (B) with a conversion, exercise or exchange price that is subject to being reset at some future date after the initial issuance of such debt or equity security or upon the occurrence of specified or contingent events directly or indirectly related to the business of the Company or the market for the ordinary shares or (ii) enters into, or effects a transaction under, any agreement, including, but not limited to, an equity line of credit or at-the-market offering facility, whereby the Company may issue securities at a future determined price.\n\nThe Company currently intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Offering closed on September 17, 2020.\n\n1  \n---  \n  \nThe Company also entered into a placement agency agreement dated September 15, 2020 (the “**Placement Agency Agreement** ”) with Maxim Group LLC, as exclusive placement agent (the “**Placement Agent** ”), pursuant to which the Placement Agent agreed to act as the placement agent in connection with the Offering. The Company agreed to pay the Placement Agent an aggregate fee equal to 7% of the gross proceeds raised in the Offering and $5,000 for non-accountable expenses. The Company also agreed to reimburse the Placement Agent for certain expenses, including for fees and expenses related to legal expenses limited to $25,000. \n\nThe Placement Agent has required that the officers and directors of the Company enter into lock-up agreements (each a “**Lock-Up Agreement** ”) pursuant to which these persons have agreed that, without the prior consent of the Placement Agent, they will not, for a period of 180 days following the closing of the Offering, subject to certain exceptions, offer, sell or otherwise dispose of or transfer any securities of the Company owned by them as of the date of the closing of the Offering or acquired during the lock-up period.\n\nA copy of the form of Placement Agency Agreement, form of the Purchase Agreement, form of Warrant, and the form of Lock-Up Agreement are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summaries of the terms of the form of Placement Agency Agreement, the form of Purchase Agreement, the form of Warrant, and the form of Lock-Up Agreement are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, such documents.\n\nOn September 16, 2020, the Company issued a press release announcing the Offering.

This summary does not contain all of the information you should consider before investing in the securities. Before making an investment decision, you should read the entire prospectus and any supplement hereto carefully, including the risk factors section, the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements incorporated herein by reference, and the documents that we incorporate by reference herein.\n\n**Our Business**\n\n**History and Development of the Company**\n\nWe are an education provider that provides performance support and music education services via our wholly-owned subsidiary, Color China Entertainment Limited, a Hong Kong limited company (“Color China”), after-school education services via our wholly-owned subsidiary CACM Group NY, Inc. (“CACM”) and our joint venture entity, Baytao LLC.\n\nColor Star Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.) was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C-corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, we changed our name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc.\n\nOn August 20, 2018, CACM Group NY, Inc. (“CACM”) was incorporated in the State of New York and is wholly owned by us. The establishment of CACM was to expand the Company’s business in the U.S. As of the date of this prospectus supplement, CACM has not commenced operations. \n\nOn December 31, 2018, we consummated a re-domicile merger pursuant to which we merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Cayman Islands company and the surviving entity in the merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger adopted in July 2018. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company is now governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nOn June 27, 2019, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of the Company’s memorandum and articles of association which was approved by the Company’s shareholders, the Company’s name was changed from China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. to Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”) and its shareholders. On February 14, 2020, the Company consummated the acquisition of Sunway Kids whereby we issued 1,989,262 ordinary shares and $2,000,000 of cash to be paid in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sunway Kids. The $2,000,000 cash consideration is payable in five installments over five years according to an earn-out schedule. Sunway Kids thereby became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Sunway Kids was established on February 29, 2012, under the laws of the British Virgin Islands as an offshore holding company. On August 23, 2018, Sunway Kids established its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brave Millenium Limited (“Brave Millenium”) under the laws of Hong Kong. On December 4, 2019, Brave Millenium established Chengdu Hengshanghui Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. (“Chengdu Hengshanghui”) in China as a wholly foreign owned limited liability company (the “WFOE”). On December 9, 2019, Chengdu Hengshanghui entered into a series of variable interest entity agreements with Chengdu Hengshanghui Education Consulting Co., Ltd. (“Hengshanghui Education”). Through Sunway Kids and its variable interest entity Hengshanghui Education, we are engaged in providing education and health services to day-care and preschools in China.\n\nS-1\n\nOn March 10, 2020, CACM entered into a certain joint venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Baydolphin, Inc., a company organized under the laws of New York (“Baydolphin”). Pursuant to the JV Agreement, CACM and Baydolphin have established a limited liability company under the laws of New York, Baytao LLC (“Baytao”), which will be the 100% owner of one or more operating entities in the U.S. to engage in the business of online and offline after-school education.\n\nPrior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, our core business had been the concrete business in China. Our concrete business is highly affected by the economic cycle and government policies. The concrete industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The entire concrete industry in the Beijing area experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years as the Beijing government continues to enforce concrete production reformation and tightened environmental laws from late 2017 to date. The reformation causes great uncertainties for local enterprises in the construction market. Since 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down. Also, the Beijing government ordered the suspension of construction jobsites during winters to reduce air pollution since 2017. The operations of Beijing Xin Ao Concrete Group Co., Ltd. (“Beijing Xin Ao”), our former variable interest entity in Beijing engaging in the concrete business, were also severely affected. As a result of the Company’s deteriorating cash position, we defaulted on bank loans and experienced a substantial increase in contingent liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, there was a default on a bank loan of $24,345,129. As of December 31, 2019, Beijing Xin Ao is subject to several civil lawsuits for which the Company estimated that it is more than likely to pay judgments in the amount of approximately $6.8 million (including interest and penalties of $1.6 million). During the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were additional estimated claims of approximately $0.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The Company believes it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to turn around the concrete business. As such, the Company disposed of the concrete business after the acquisition of Sunway Kids in more detail as below.\n\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company completed the disposition (the “Disposition”) of its former subsidiary, Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (“BVI-ACM”), after obtaining its shareholders’ approval on April 27, 2020 and satisfaction or waiver of all other closing conditions. Upon the closing of the Disposition, Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He became the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The proceeds of $600,000 from the Disposition will be used for the Company’s working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nOn May 1, 2020, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of its memorandum and articles of association (which was approved by the Company’s shareholders), the Company’s name was changed to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Color China and the shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company will acquire all of the outstanding issued shares and other equity interests in Color China from the Sellers (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Color China, the Company agreed to issue 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company and pay an aggregate of $2,000,000 to the Sellers. Headquartered in Hong Kong, China, Color China is an emerging performance equipment and music education provider with a significant collection of performance specific assets and unique experience in working with many renowned artists. On June 3, 2020, the transaction contemplated by the Exchange Agreement consummated when the Company issued 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company to the Sellers and the Sellers transferred all of Color China’s issued and outstanding shares to the Company. As such, the Company owns 100% of Color China.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the Company, Sunway Kids, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, and the former shareholders of Sunway Kids entered into Amendment No. 2 (the “Amendment”) to the Share Exchange Agreement dated December 31, 2019, as previously amended. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company shall not make any the Earn-out Payment to the former shareholders of Sunway Kids since Sunway Kids has been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and management of Sunway Kids believes it will be very difficult to achieve its projected financial results. On the same day, Sunway Kids and Yanliang Han (the “Purchaser”), entered into certain share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the Purchaser agreed to purchase Sunway Kids in exchange for cash consideration of $2,400,000 consisting of $400,000 which was paid within a month of closing, and $2,000,000 to be paid in monthly installments of $200,000 over 10 months. Upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Disposition SPA on June 25, 2020, the Purchaser became the sole shareholder of Sunway Kids and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by Sunway Kids and they are no longer subsidiaries and variable interest entities of the Company.\n\nS-2\n\nBelow is the Company’s corporate structure chart as of the date of this prospectus supplement.\n\n![](image_001.jpg)\n\n**Business Overview**\n\n_Performance Support and Music Education Business_\n\nColor China is in the performance support and music education business with a significant collection of music performance specific equipment. Color China’s management team has experience in large-scale entertainment performance, equipment leasing and IP licensing. Color China’s founders have experience in working with many artists in Asia and North America and have also established good relationships with many record companies and entertainment agencies in Asia and North America. Leveraging its resources, Color China is in the process of building an online entertainment and music education platform, “Color World,” featuring artists as its lead instructors.\n\nWe believe that the Color World platform being built by Color China and CACM will bring innovative changes to the current state of music education and entertainment industry. We believe that through the Internet, Color World platform can provide professional entertainment and music education globally.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and caused massive global health and economic crisis, while also causing large-scale social and behavioral changes in societies. We believe Color China’s business plan could satisfy people’s entertainment need during this pandemic as most of our business is conducted on a “touch-free” online basis, and therefore expects to focus on the expansion of Color China’s business in light of its potential for revenue generation and profitability.\n\nColor China has entered into various educational licensing and performance agreements with artists and professionals (“Star Teachers”) in the entertainment industry for their services as instructors on the Color World platform and has secured the rights to the exclusive streaming of online lessons taught by the Star Teachers on the platform. Color China is also in the process of seeking out and contracting more Star Teachers in a variety of fields such as music, film, sports, animation, television, presentations, dance, and art to provide its prospective student subscribers with a large repertoire of first-hand exposure to and lessons from professionals in their desired fields.\n\nThe Color World platform will generate revenue primarily through paid membership subscriptions to our online courses. The Company also plans to generate revenue through the sales of relevant products, including but not limited to peripheral products of entertainment stars and trendy brands. Over time, we may develop more sources of revenues. Our freemium model allows us to attract users with free services and convert them into paying users. On our “Color World” platform, individual users can access a number of our courses and services for free. We convert non-paying users to paying users through a variety of means. For example, we intend to provide free trial periods to our users to allow them try premium contents that can usually be accessed exclusively by paid subscribers, free credits to users for trying premium courses, prompts with personalized suggestions on how users can improve their skills with links to our paid courses, and discounts on peripheral products for paid subscribers.\n\nS-3\n\n_Joint Venture with Baydolphin, Inc._\n\nOn March 10, 2020, CACM entered into the JV Agreement with Baydolphin. Pursuant to the JV Agreement, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, CACM and Baydolphin agreed to establish a limited company under the laws of New York, Baytao LLC (the “JV”), which will be the 100% owner of one or more operating entities in the U.S. to engage in the business of after-school education (the “Operating Entities”).\n\nPursuant to the JV Agreement, CACM shall contribute necessary capital for the Operating Entities to fund their operations and obtain the right to use of certain software platform and other technologies related to it from the Company, which will be provided to the JV and Operating Entities with no charge to facilitate the operation of the Operating Entities and provide online classes to the registered students of Operating Entities, and Baydolphin shall be responsible for managing the Operating Entities with its expertise in after-school education, including but not limited to recruiting and training personnel for the Operating Entities and implementing all promotional and marketing activities incidental to the Operating Entities. Eighty percent (80%) of the net profits or net loss of the joint venture will be distributed to or assigned to CACM and the remaining twenty percent (20%) being distributed to or assigned to Baydolphin.\n\n_U.S. After-School Education Business_\n\nPursuant to the JV Agreement, once Baytao sets up one or more Operating Entities, CACM shall contribute the necessary capital for the Operating Entities to fund their operations, and the Company will provide Baytao and Operating Entities with the use of its technologies at no extra costs to facilitate the operations of the Operating Entities and provide online classes to the registered students of the Operating Entities. Furthermore, Baydolphin is responsible for managing the Operating Entities with its expertise in after-school education, including but not limited to recruiting and training personnel for the Operating Entities and implementing all promotional and marketing activities incidental to the Operating Entities.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nOn September 4, 2020, the Company and GPL Ventures LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“GPL”) entered into a securities purchase agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to GPL an aggregate of up to 3,174,603 ordinary shares, in a registered direct offering, for gross proceeds of up to approximately $2 million. These shares were agreed to be issued in four separate installments. The first installment of $500,000 worth of shares, or 793,651 shares were issued at $0.63 per share and the first offering closed on September 8, 2020. The Company also issued 31,746 ordinary shares to GPL as additional consideration. Pursuant to such securities purchase agreement, each of GPL and the Company has the right not to proceed with any subsequent installments, with or without cause by giving the other party notice. On September 15, 2020, the securities purchase agreement was terminated. No additional ordinary shares of the Company were sold to GPL after the closing of the first installment of $500,000.\n\nOn August 21, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with a non-affiliated third party pursuant to which the Company purchased certain machinery and equipment for stage performance (the “Purchased Assets”) for a total purchase price of $6,818,000, of which $3,000,000 shall be paid in cash and the remaining $3,818,000 shall be paid in the form of 6,060,318 ordinary shares of the Company, valued at $0.63 per share, the closing price of our ordinary shares on August 20, 2020. $2,000,000 of the cash consideration was paid and the remaining $1,000,000 shall be paid within sixty days of the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Purchased Assets will be in furtherance of the Company’s performance support and music education business.\n\nOn August 12, 2020, Wei Pei tendered his notice of resignation to the Company due to personal reason, effective on the date thereof. Mr. Pei had served as Company’s independent director, Chairperson of the Nominating and Governance Committee and member of the Audit and Compensation Committee. On the same date, the Board of Directors (“the Board”) of the Company appointed Mr. Hung-Jen Kuo to fill the vacancies left by Mr. Pei in the all of his positions with the Company.\n\nOn July 20, 2020, the Company and certain institutional investors entered into certain securities purchase agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to such investors an aggregate of 3,225,000 ordinary shares in a registered direct offering and warrants to purchase up to 2,096,252 ordinary shares in a concurrent private placement, for gross proceeds of approximately $4.19 million. This offering closed on July 22, 2020.\n\nOn July 17, 2020, Yang (Sean) Liu resigned from his position as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chairman of the Board. On the same date, Mr. Liu was appointed as the Vice President of Technology of the Company.\n\nOn July 17, 2020, Biao Lu was appointed as CEO and Chairman of the Board to fill in the vacancy created by Mr. Liu’s resignation, effective immediately.\n\n**Corporate Information**\n\nOur principal executive office is located on 800 3rd Ave, Suite 2800, New York, NY 10022.

If any of the following events actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations and could result in a complete loss of your investment._\n\n_You should also carefully consider the risk factors set forth under “Risk Factors” described in our most recent annual report on Form 20-F, filed on November 15, 2019, together with all other information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and in any related free writing prospectus in connection with a specific offering, before making an investment decision._\n\n**Risks Related to the Current Pandemic**\n\n**_Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19._**\n\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus causing respiratory illness, or COVID-19, has surfaced in Wuhan, China, spreading at a fast rate in January and February of 2020, and confirmed cases were also reported in other parts of the world. In reaction to this outbreak, an increasing number of countries imposed travel suspensions to and from China following the World Health Organization’s “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) announcement on January 30, 2020. Since this outbreak, business activities in China and many other countries including U.S. have been disrupted by a series of emergency quarantine measures taken by the government.\n\nAs a result, our operations in China and U.S. have been materially affected. Our offices in Chengdu were temporarily closed until early March. Although our offices re-opened in early March, since no children have been allowed to attend daycare centers or preschools as of the date of this Prospectus, Sunway Kids has not been able to generate any meaningful revenue since the start of the pandemic. Additionally, New York, where our U.S. operations are based, is currently significantly affected by COVID-19, which led to measures taken by the New York government trying to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as closure of schools and travel restrictions. Additional travel and other restrictions may be put in place to further control the outbreak in U.S. As a result of these, management has to temporarily postpone the rolling out of our afterschool centers in New York. The launching of the online education platform we are jointly developing with Color China has also been delayed. Accordingly, our operation and business have been and will continue to be adversely affected as the results of the wide-spread pandemic. Management may have to adjust or change our business plan in response to the prolonged pandemic and change of social behavior.\n\nThe extent to which COVID-19 negatively impacts our business is highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We believe that the coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to control it may have a significant negative impact on not only our business, but economic activities globally. The magnitude of this negative effect on the continuity of our business operation in China and U.S. remains uncertain. These uncertainties impede our ability to conduct our daily operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result affect our stock price and create more volatility.\n\nS-6\n\n**Risks Related to our Joint Venture with Baydolphin, Inc.**\n\n**_We may not be able to oversee the new joint venture efficiently._**\n\nWe may not be able to oversee Baytao, our new joint venture, efficiently, realize anticipated profits or effectively implement our growth and operating strategies. As we begin our operations in the United States through our joint venture, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. We will need to transition from a company with our primary operations in China to a company capable of supporting operations in both China and the United States. We might not be successful in such a transition. There can be no guarantee that the addition of the new joint venture will not cause us to incur additional debt and increase our exposure to market and other risks. Our failure to successfully pursue our strategies or effectively operate the joint venture entity could also have a material adverse effect on our rate of growth and operating performance.\n\n**_There may be integration issues between Baytao and Color China’s technologies._**\n\nThe services provided by Baytao will need to be integrated with Color China’s existing software and technologies so as to achieve our operating strategies. If we are unable to achieve a successful integration with Color China’s software and technologies, we may not be successful in developing and marketing our new services and courses and our operating results will materially suffer. In addition, if the integrated services and courses we offer do not achieve acceptance by the marketplace, our operating results will materially suffer. Also, if new industry standards emerge that we do not anticipate or adapt to, our software products could be rendered obsolete and, as a result, our business and operating results, as well as our ability to compete in the marketplace, would be materially harmed.\n\n**Risks Related to our Acquisition of Color China Entertainment Limited**\n\n**_We may not be able to oversee the combined entity efficiently._**\n\nWe may not be able to oversee the combined entity efficiently, realize anticipated profits or effectively implement our growth and operating strategies. We are now managing two related businesses in the education industry, the music education business conducted through Color China and the online learning platform conducted via Baytao, which have different customers, suppliers, and competition landscapes. This involves risks that could adversely affect our operating results due to uncertainties involved with the new business, diversion of management’s attention in operating and managing the new business. There can be no guarantee that the addition of the new business will not cause us to incur additional debt and increase our exposure to market and other risks. In addition, Color China’s management team has very little experience with the necessary disclosure practices of a public company and may not be able to timely provide sufficient information to our accounting staff. Our failure to successfully pursue our strategies or effectively operate and manage the combined entity could also have a material adverse effect on our rate of growth and operating performance.\n\n**Risks Related to our Education Service Business**\n\n**_If we are unable to launch and operate the “Color World” platform as planned, our results of operation will be significantly impacted._**\n\nThe launch of the “Color World” platform will depend on many factors, including realistic scheduling of the development time, the effectiveness of quality control, maintaining high productivity when facing unexpected technical difficulties, the time to obtain and integrate third-party services, the changes in availabilities of software and hardware infrastructures provided by third parties, and sudden changes in government policies. Once Color World has launched, the attractiveness of our platform to our prospective “Star Teachers” and student subscribers also depends on our ability to innovate. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and expand our platform and education services. We must also continue to enhance and improve our technology infrastructure. These efforts may require us to develop or license increasingly complex technologies. In addition, new education services and technologies developed and introduced by competitors could render our education services and technologies obsolete if we are unable to update or modify our own technology. Developing and integrating new education services and technologies into our existing platform and infrastructure could be expensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, any new features and functions may not achieve market acceptance. We may not succeed in implementing new technologies, or may incur substantial costs in doing so. Our platform and education services must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order for us to recoup our investments. Our platform and education services could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:\n\n● | we may fail to predict market demand accurately and to provide education services that meet this demand in a timely fashion;  \n---|---  \n  \nS-7\n\n● | our marketing efforts may be inefficient and fail to attract the potential users;  \n---|---  \n● | Star Teachers that we recruit on our platforms may not like, find useful or agree with any changes;  \n---|---  \n● | there may be defects, errors or failures on our platform;  \n---|---  \n● | there may be negative publicity about our platforms’ performance or effectiveness; and  \n---|---  \n● | there may be competing services or technologies introduced or anticipated to be introduced by our competitors.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf our platform and education services or technologies do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n**_Our success relies on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and qualified key personnel, and our business may be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate them._**\n\nOur business operations depend on the continued services of our senior management team and qualified key personnel, particularly our executive officers and the senior management of Color China, our wholly owned subsidiary.\n\nAlthough we have provided different incentives to our senior management team, we cannot assure you that we can continue to retain their services. One or more of our key executives may be unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions. Meanwhile, we have also provided attractive compensation packages to our qualified key personnel. However, we may not be able to hire and retain these personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Some of the companies with which we compete for qualified and skilled personnel have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. In addition, we invest significant time and resources in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them.\n\nIf we are unable to retain the services of our senior management team or qualified key personnel, we may not be able to find suitable replacements or may incur significant expenses in finding such replacements, thus our future growth may be constrained, our business may be severely disrupted and our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, although we have entered into confidentiality and non-competition agreements with our senior management team and qualified key personnel, there is no assurance that any member of our senior management team or any of our qualified key personnel will not join a competitor. In the event that any dispute arises between us, on one hand, and any of our senior management and qualified key personnel, on the other hand, we may have to incur substantial costs and expenses in order to enforce such agreements, or we may be unable to enforce them at all.\n\n**_If we are unable to recruit “Star Teachers” as planned or if these instructors do not perform according to the agreements we have with them, the operation of our performance support and music education business will be negatively impacted._**\n\nProfessional artists and producers that we have begun recruiting as our Star Teachers help us build and maintain the quality of our education and services, as well as our brand and reputation. Our ability to continue to attract recruit the instructors with the necessary experience and qualifications is a key factor in the success of our operations. We seek to continue hiring experienced and successful professionals in music, film, sports, animation, television, presentations, dance, art and other entertainment industries whom are able to follow our education service protocols and deliver effective instructions based on the agreements we have with them. The market for the recruitment of these professionals is competitive, and we must also provide continued training to ensure that our instructors stay abreast of changes in student demands, teaching methodologies and other necessary changes.\n\nIn order to recruit these industry professionals as instructors on our platform, we must provide candidates with competitive compensation packages. Although we have not experienced major difficulties in recruiting or training qualified instructors thus far, we cannot guarantee we will be able to continue to recruit, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified instructors in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nS-8\n\n**_If we are unable to reach a critical mass of subscribers, our revenues may not be sufficient to cover the costs of our recruitment of Star Teachers._**\n\nWe are obligated to pay each of our Star Teachers on a case-by-case basis depending on the results of our negotiations. Some Star Teachers will accept fixed payments following a predefined schedule, whereas others may instead request a revenue sharing payment model whereby we will need to distribute to the Star Teachers a percentage of the net income earned from generated sales, licensing or other revenue from their courses on our platform, including a pro rata share of our subscription fees, or a hybrid of the two. If we are unable to generate enough revenue from our subscription fees from our users to cover our Star Teachers’ recruitment costs, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n**_Our education service revenue model depends on developing a subscriber base of users. If we fail to reach a critical mass of subscribers, our net revenues may decline, and we may not be able to implement our business plan._**\n\nWe expect to generate revenue primarily from the fees we collect from our users. It is critical for us to enroll subscribers in a cost-effective manner. Some of the factors, many of which are largely beyond our control, could prevent us from successfully increasing subscriptions in a cost-effective manner, or at all. These factors include, among other things, (i) reduced interest in the products and services we offer; (ii) negative publicity or perceptions regarding us, or electronic education services in general; (iii) the emergence of alternative technologies not offered by us; (iv) the inability of subscribers to pay the fees; (v) increasing market competition, particularly price reductions by competitors that we are unable or unwilling to match; and (vi) adverse changes in relevant government policies or general economic conditions. If one or more of these factors reduce market demand for our services, our subscriber base may not materialize as anticipated or our costs associated with subscriber acquisition and retention could increase, or both, any of which could materially affect our ability to grow our gross billings and net revenues. These developments could also harm our brand and reputation, which would negatively impact our ability to establish or expand our business.\n\n**_We expect to invest in our growth for the foreseeable future. If we fail to manage this growth effectively, the success of our business model will be compromised._**\n\nWe anticipate rapid growth in gross billings and net revenues upon the acquisition of our childhood education business segment, which growth is expected to be driven primarily by the growth of our subscriber base. Rapid growth may place a significant strain on our sales and marketing capacities, administrative and operating infrastructure, facilities and other resources. To manage our anticipated our growth, we may need to continue to acquire more subscribers, scale up our product and service offerings, as well as strengthen our platforms and systems. We will also be required to refine our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to efficiently manage the establishment and future expansion of our business, our costs and expenses may increase more than we plan and we may not successfully attract a sufficient number of subscribers and strategic partners in a cost-effective manner, respond to competitive challenges, or otherwise execute our business plans. In addition, we may, as part of carrying out our growth strategies, adopt new initiatives to offer additional educational content and to implement new pricing models and strategies. We cannot assure you that these initiatives may achieve the anticipated results. These proposed changes may not be well received by our existing and prospective users, in which case their experience with our education services may suffer, which could damage our reputation and business prospects.\n\nOur ability to effectively implement our strategies and manage any significant growth of our business will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to: (i) identify and effectively market our products and services in new markets with sufficient growth potential; (ii) develop and improve service and product offerings to make them appealing to our users; (iii) maintain and increase our subscriber base; (iv) effectively recruit, train and motivate a large number of new employees, including sales and marketing personnel; (v) successfully implement enhancements and improvements to the systems and platforms; (vi) continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and efficiencies; (vii) protect and further develop our intellectual property rights; and (viii) make sound business decisions in light of the scrutiny associated with operating as a public company. These activities require significant capital expenditures and investment of valuable management and financial resources, and our growth will continue to place significant demands on our management. There are no guarantees that we will be able to effectively manage any future growth in an efficient, cost-effective and timely manner, or at all. If we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, our reputation, results of operations and overall business and prospects could be negatively impacted.\n\nS-9\n\n**_We expect to rely heavily on information and technology to operate our existing and future education products and services, and any cybersecurity incident or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could result in the loss of critical confidential information or adversely impact our reputation, business or results of operations._**\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and to compete effectively depends in part upon the satisfactory performance and reliability of our technology network, including the ability to provide features of services that are important to our customers and to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers. We also rely on our technology to maintain and process various operating and financial data that are essential to the day-to-day operation of our business and formulation of our development strategies. Our business operations and growth prospects depend on our ability to maintain and make timely and cost-effective enhancements and upgrades to our technology system and to introduce innovative additions that can meet changing operational needs in future. Therefore, we expect to continue to invest in advanced information technology and any equipment to enhance operational efficiency and reliability as we grow. Accordingly, any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our IT infrastructure could damage our reputation, decrease user satisfaction and retention, adversely impact our ability to attract new users and expand our service and product offerings, and materially disrupt our operations. If any of these occur, our business operations, reputation and prospects could be harmed.\n\n**_If our security measures are breached or fail and result in unauthorized disclosure of data by our employees or our third-party agents, we could lose existing subscribers, fail to attract new subscribers and be exposed to protracted and costly litigation._**\n\nMaintaining platform security is of critical importance to our subscribers because the platform stores and transmits proprietary and confidential information, which may include sensitive personally identifiable information that may be subject to stringent legal and regulatory obligations. As an electronic education service provider, we face an increasing number of threats to our IT infrastructure, including unauthorized activity and access by our employees or third-party agents, system viruses, worms, malicious code and organized cyber-attacks, which could breach our security and disrupt our business. We hope to introduce data security and confidentiality protocols into the cooperation agreements we enter into with third-party sales agents with whom we share prospective subscribers’ contact information. As we expand, we hope to invest in improving our technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans to prevent unauthorized access of confidential or sensitive personal information by our employees and third-party sales agents in the process of engaging prospective subscribers.\n\nThese measures, however, may not be as effective as we anticipate. In addition, there is no assurance that our third-party sales agents will comply with contractual and legal requirements with respect to data privacy when they collect data from our prospective customers. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, we could be subject to liability or our business could be interrupted, potentially over an extended period of time. Any or all of these issues could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to attract and enroll prospective subscribers, cause prospective subscribers not to enroll or stay enrolled, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability. Further, any reputational damage resulting from breach of our security measures could create distrust of our company by prospective subscribers or investors. We may be required to expend significant management time and additional resources to protect against the threat of these disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such disruptions or breaches.\n\n**_Privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our user data and disclosure of user data could adversely impact our business and reputation._**\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business and in particular in connection with conducting sales and marketing activities with our existing and prospective subscribers as well as the utilization of our AI-powered platform programs, we collect and utilize data supplied by our users. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our users in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results.\n\nS-10\n\nInternationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\n**_We face regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to the licensing requirement for the online transmission of internet audio-visual programs in China._**\n\nOn December 20, 2007, the National Radio and Television Administration f/k/a known as the State Administration of Press Publication Radio Film and Television, or SAPPRFT, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, jointly promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Internet Audio Visual Program Services, or the Audio Visual Program Provisions, which became effective on January 31, 2008 and were amended on August 28, 2015. Among other things, the Audio Visual Program Provisions stipulate that no entities or individuals may provide Internet audio-visual program services without a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs issued by SAPPRFT or completing the relevant filing with SAPPRFT or its local bureaus, and only state-owned or state-controlled entities are eligible to apply for a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs. On April 1, 2010, SAPPRFT promulgated the Provisional Implementations of Tentative Categories of Internet Audio Visual Program Services, or the Categories, which clarified the scope of Internet audio-visual programs services, which was amended on March 10, 2017. According to the Categories, there are four categories of Internet audio-visual program services which are further divided into seventeen sub-categories. Sub-category No. 3 to the second category covers the making and editing of certain specialized audio-visual programs concerning, among other things, educational content, and broadcasting such content to the general public online. Sub-category No. 5 of the first category and sub-category No. 7 of the second category cover the live broadcasting of important political, martial, economic, social, cultural, sports activities or events or general social or community cultural activities, sports games and other organized activities. However, there are still significant uncertainties relating to the interpretation and implementation of the Audio Visual Program Provisions, in particular, the scope of “internet audio-visual programs.” See “Regulations Relating to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs.”\n\nWe plan to deliver our courses in live streaming format worldwide. Our teachers and students communicate and interact live with each other via our virtual learning community. The audio and video data will likely be transmitted through the platforms between specific recipients instantly without any further redaction. We believe the nature of the raw data we transmit will distinguish us from general providers of internet audio-visual program services, such as the operator of online video websites, and the provision of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions are not applicable with regard to our offering of the courses. However, we cannot assure you that the competent PRC government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to our opinion. In addition, we also plan to offer video recordings of live streaming courses and certain other audio-video contents on our electronic platforms to our students as supplementary course materials on our platforms. If the government authorities determine that our offering of the courses fall within the relevant category of Internet audio-visual program services under the Categories, we may be required to obtain the License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs.\n\nThe Categories describe “Internet audio-visual program services” in a very broad, vague manner and are unclear as to whether electronic courses, whether delivered in a live streaming format or through video recordings, fall into the definition of audio-visual programs. We have made inquiries to the relevant bureaus of SAPPRFT and were informed that online educational content provided through live streaming or recorded courses does not fall within the scope of internet audio-visual programs, the transmission of which does not require a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs. We cannot assure you that the PRC government will not ultimately take a view that live streaming or recorded courses or any other content offered on our platforms are subject to the Audio Visual Program Provisions. We currently do not hold a license for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs, and since we are not a state-owned or state-controlled entity, we are not eligible to apply for such license. If the PRC government determines that our content should be considered as “internet audio- visual programs” for the purpose of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, we may be required to obtain a license for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs. We are, however, not eligible apply for such license since we are not a state-owned or state-controlled entity. If this were to occur, we may be subject to penalties, fines, legal sanctions or an order to suspend the provision of our live streaming courses. As of the date of this annual report, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities regarding the lack of a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs in conducting of our business.\n\nS-11\n\n**_Our failure to obtain and maintain approvals, licenses or permits in China applicable to our business could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations in the future._**\n\nAs we plan to deliver our courses in live streaming format worldwide, including in China, we may be subject to various regulations by a number of PRC regulatory authorities, such as the SAIC, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the MITT, the National Radio and Television Administration, and the State Council Information Office, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Welfare. We may be required in the future to obtain additional government approvals, licenses and permits in connection with our operations.\n\nBy way of example, depending upon regulatory interpretation, under the current PRC laws and regulations, the provision of our educational content through our electronic platform may be considered “online publishing” and may require us to obtain an Internet Publishing License, which we currently do not have.\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities regarding the lack of any the above-mentioned approvals, licenses or permits. However, we cannot guarantee that the government authorities will not impose any penalties or sanctions on us in the future, which may include warnings, fines, mandates to remedy any violations, confiscation of the gains derived from the services for which approvals, licenses or permits are required, and/or an order to cease to provide such services. In addition, we cannot guarantee that the government will not promulgate new laws and regulations that require additional licenses, permits and/or approvals for the operation of any of our existing or future business. If we are unable to obtain such licenses, permits, or approvals in a timely fashion, we could be subject to penalties and operational disruption and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n**_We face intense competition which could adversely affect our results of operations and market share._**\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is sensitive to price, content (_i.e._ , curriculum) and quality of service. Some of our competitors may have more financial resources, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do, or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to obtain or raise capital and enter into strategic relationships more easily. We also compete with leading domestic supplier companies based on a number of factors including business model, operational capabilities, cost control and service quality, as well as in-house delivery capabilities to serve their logistics needs and compete with us.\n\nWe are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that affect many other businesses, including but not limited to:\n\n(1) | Increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare benefits;  \n---|---  \n(2) | The increasing costs of compliance with federal, state and foreign governmental agency mandates;  \n---|---  \n(3) | Any impacts on our business resulting from new domestic and international government laws and regulation;  \n---|---  \n(4) | Market conditions in the childhood education industry or the economy as a whole;  \n---|---  \n(5) | Market acceptance of our new service and growth initiatives;  \n---|---  \n(6) | Announcements of the introduction of new products and services by our competitors;  \n---|---  \n(7) | The impact of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our products and services;  \n---|---  \n(8) | Developments concerning current or future strategic collaborations; and  \n---|---  \n(9) | Widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis such as we are currently experiencing with the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf we are unable to respond to these changing market conditions, our business and financial results may be materially affected.\n\nS-12\n\n**Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares**\n\n**_If we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, we would face possible delisting, which would result in a limited public market for our shares and make obtaining future debt or equity financing more difficult for us._**\n\nOn November 18, 2019, we received a notification letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Stockholder Equity Requirement”). The notification received had no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Nasdaq has provided us with 45 calendar days, or until January 2, 2020, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity standard. If our plan to regain compliance is accepted, Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notification letter, or until May 16, 2019, to evidence compliance. On January 2, 2020, we submitted our plan of compliance to Nasdaq.\n\nOn January 24, 2020, we received a notice (the “Notice”) from Nasdaq stating that we were not able to regain compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement or the alternative criteria set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b) and that the Staff had determined to seek to delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq unless the Company requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). On January 28, 2020 we requested a hearing before the Panel. Such request will stay any suspension or delisting action by Nasdaq pending the completion of the hearing process. On January 30, 2020, we received a hearing instruction letter from Nasdaq stating that the delisting action referenced in the Notice has been stayed, pending a final written decision by the Panel.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, the Company appeared before the Panel to demonstrate its ability to regain compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement and subsequently submitted supplemental information to the Panel on March 23, 2020 pursuant to the Panel’s request. By a letter dated April 16, 2020, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that the Panel had determined to continue the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares based upon the Company’s compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement. Additionally, the Panel advised in such letter that is has placed the Company under a Panel Monitor (the “Monitor”) that shall last through April 15, 2021. Pursuant to that Monitor and as provided in the Nasdaq Rules, if at any time during the monitor period the Company fails to maintain compliance with any listing standard, Nasdaq will issue a Staff Delisting Determination and the Hearings Department will promptly schedule a new hearing.\n\nSeparately, on March 5, 2020, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Requirement”). The notification received has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company has until September 1, 2020 to regain compliance. If at any time during such 180-day period the closing bid price of the Company’s ordinary shares is at least $1 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company written confirmation of compliance.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2), as the Company maintained a closing bid price of $1.00 per share or greater for twenty (20) consecutive days from July 13, 2020 through August 7, 2020.\n\nOur offering price under this prospectus supplement is lower than $1.00 per ordinary share and we cannot predict whether our ordinary shares will continue trading at a price lower than $1.00 per share after this offering. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain the compliance with the Nasdaq rules. If we fail to comply with the Bid Price Requirement or any other listing rules when required in the future, we could be subject to suspension and delisting proceedings. If our securities lose their status on The NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities would likely trade in the over-the-counter market. If our securities were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our securities could be more difficult because smaller quantities of securities would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts’ coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event our securities are delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, further limiting the liquidity of our securities. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities. Such delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market and continued or further declines in our share price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions. \n\n**_The price of our ordinary shares historically has been volatile, which may affect the price at which you could sell the ordinary shares._**\n\nOur ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “HHT.” The market price for the ordinary shares has varied between a high bid price of $3.00 on September 17, 2019 and a low bid price of $0.31 on June 4, 2020 in the 12-month period ending on September 15, 2020. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell the ordinary shares. The ordinary share price are likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors” and under “Risk Factors” in our most recent annual report on Form 20-F and our subsequent filings with the SEC.\n\nS-13\n\n**USE OF PROCEEDS**\n\nWe estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $6.1 million after deducting the placement agent fees and the estimated offering expenses payable by us.\n\nWe intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for improving and expanding our existing business, working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n\nThe amounts and timing of our use of proceeds will vary depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash generated or used by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, while we have not entered into any agreements, commitments or understandings relating to any significant transaction as of the date of this prospectus supplement, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic transactions.\n\nWe will not receive any proceeds from the sale of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants of the concurrent private placement unless and until such warrants are exercised. If the warrants are fully exercised for cash, we will receive additional proceeds of up to approximately $6.53 million.\n\nPending the final application of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade securities.\n\n**DILUTION**\n\nIf you invest in our ordinary shares, your interest will be diluted immediately to the extent of the difference between the public offering price per share and the adjusted net tangible book value per share of our ordinary shares after this offering.\n\nOur net tangible book value on December 31, 2019 was approximately $19.5 million, or $0.48 per share. “Net tangible book value” is total assets minus the sum of liabilities and intangible assets. “Net tangible book value per share” is net tangible book value divided by the total number of shares outstanding. Our net tangible book value on December 31, 2019 includes consideration of the following issuances:\n\n● | Issuance of 3,403,037 ordinary shares in January 2020 in connection with debt repayments of approximately $5.24 million;  \n---|---  \n● | Issuance and sale of 2,000,000 ordinary shares in January 2020 in connection with a private placement;  \n---|---  \n● | Issuance of 1,989,262 ordinary shares in February 2020 in connection with an acquisition;  \n---|---  \n● | Issuance of 2,727,274 ordinary shares on April 2, 2020 in connection with a registered direct offering;  \n---|---  \n● | Issuance of 2,600,000 ordinary shares on May 13, 2020 in connection with a registered direct offering;  \n---|---  \n● | Issuance of 4,633,333 ordinary shares in June 2020 in connection with an acquisition;   \n---|---  \n● | Issuance of 420,000 ordinary shares in June 2020 for services to two officers;  \n---|---  \n● | Issuance of 3,225,000 ordinary shares on July 22, 2020 in connection with a registered direct offering;  \n● | Issuance of 6,060,318 ordinary shares on August 21, 2020 in connection with assets acquisition;  \n● | Issuance of 5,227,274 ordinary shares in August and September 2020 in connection with the exercise of warrants; and  \n● | Issuance of 825,397 ordinary shares on September 8, 2020 in connection with a registered direct offering.  \n  \nAfter giving effect to the sale of our ordinary shares of $6.6 million in this offering at an assumed offering price of $0.50 per share, and after deducting the placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us in connection with this offering and our concurrent private placement of warrants, our as adjusted net tangible book value as of December 31, 2019 would have been approximately $25.6 million, or approximately $0.47 per ordinary share. This represents an immediate decrease in net tangible book value of $0.01 per share to our existing shareholders and an immediate decrease in net tangible book value of $0.03 per share to investors participating in this offering. The following table illustrates this dilution per share to investors participating in this offering:\n\nAssumed offering price per share | $| 0.50  \n---|---|---  \nNet tangible book value per share as of December 31, 2019 | $| 0.48  \nDecrease in net tangible book value per share attributable to existing investors | $| (0.01| )  \nNet tangible book value per share after giving effect to this offering | $| 0.47  \nDilution per share to new investors | $| (0.03| )  \n  \nThe above discussion and table are based on 7,850,916 ordinary shares outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including pro forma shares issued as discussed above and excludes, as of such date, the following: 11,880,000 ordinary shares issuable to certain investors upon exercise of the warrants offered in the concurrent private placement, 50,000 ordinary shares issuable to certain investors upon the exercise of the warrants issued in a private placement that closed on April 2, 2020, 50,000 ordinary shares issuable to certain investors upon the exercise of the warrants issued in a private placement that closed on May 13, 2020, and 2,096,252 ordinary shares issuable to certain investors upon exercise of the warrants issued in a private placement that closed on July 22, 2020.\n\nTo the extent that we grant additional options or other awards under our stock incentive plan or issue additional warrants, or we issue additional ordinary shares in the future, there may be further dilution.\n\nS-14\n\n**DIVIDEND POLICY**\n\nWhile we have no current intention of paying dividends, should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments.\n\n**CAPITALIZATION**\n\nThe following table sets forth our capitalization as of December 31, 2019:\n\n● | on an actual basis;  \n---|---  \n● | on a pro forma, as adjusted basis to give effect to the issuance and sale of 13,200,000 ordinary shares at the offering price of $0.50 per share in this offering, after deducting placement agent fees and expenses and estimated offering expenses payable by us;

and 50,000 ordinary shares issuable to certain investors upon the exercise of the warrants issued in a private placement that closed on May 13, 2020.\n\nTo the extent that we grant additional options or other awards under our stock incentive plan or issue additional warrants, or we issue additional ordinary shares in the future, there may be further dilution.\n\nS-15\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF OUR SECURITIES WE ARE OFFERING**\n\nWe are offering 13,200,000 of our ordinary shares pursuant to this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. The material terms and provisions of our ordinary shares are described under the caption “Descriptions of Share Capital” beginning on page 10 of the accompanying prospectus.\n\n**PRIVATE PLACEMENT TRANSACTION OF WARRANTS**\n\nIn a concurrent private placement, we will issue and sell to the same investors warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 11,880,000 ordinary shares at an exercise price equal to $0.55 per share.\n\nThe warrants and the ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of such warrants are not being registered under the Securities Act, are not being offered pursuant to this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and are being offered pursuant to the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506(b) of Regulation D. Accordingly, investors may only sell ordinary shares issued upon exercise of the warrants pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those shares, an exemption under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or another applicable exemption under the Securities Act.\n\n_Exercisability_. The warrants are exercisable for a period of five and one-half years commencing on September 17, 2020 and expiring March 17, 2026. The warrants will be exercisable, at the option of each holder, in whole or in part by delivering to us a duly executed exercise notice and, at any time a registration statement registering the issuance of ordinary shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act is effective and available for the issuance of such shares, or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act is available for the issuance of such shares, by payment in full in immediately available funds for the number of ordinary shares purchased upon such exercise. If a registration statement registering the issuance of the ordinary shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act is not effective or available, at any time after the six-month anniversary of the issue date, the holder may, in its sole discretion, elect to exercise the warrants through a cashless exercise, in which case the holder would receive upon such exercise the net number of ordinary shares determined according to the formula set forth in the warrant.\n\n_Exercise Limitation_. A holder will not have the right to exercise any portion of the warrants if the holder (together with its affiliates and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder’s affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% (or, upon election of the holder, 9.99%) of the number of our ordinary shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the warrants. Any holder may increase or decrease such percentage, but in no event may such percentage be increased to more than 9.99%, provided that any increase will not be effective until the 61st day after such election.\n\n_Exercise Price Adjustment_. The exercise price of the warrants is subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting our ordinary shares and also upon any distributions of assets, including cash, stock or other property to our shareholders. The terms of the warrants, including these anti-dilution protections, may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital at prevailing market terms in the future.\n\n_Mandatory Exercise._ If at any time while the warrants are outstanding, the closing price of our ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market or other principal market on which it is traded equals or exceeds 400% of the purchase price per ordinary share in this offering (or $2.00 per share) (which amount may be adjusted for certain capital events, such as stock splits, as described in the warrants) for twenty (20) consecutive trading days, then we shall have the right to require the holders to exercise for cash, all or any portion of their warrants that have not been exercised on the mandatory exercise date specified in the notice that we shall provide to such holders into fully paid, validly issued and nonassessable ordinary shares in accordance with the terms of the warrants.\n\n_Exchange Listing_. There is no established trading market for the warrants and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply for the listing of the warrants on any national securities exchange or other trading market.\n\nS-16\n\n_Fundamental Transactions_. If (i) we, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effect any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another person, (ii) we, directly or indirectly, effect any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by us or another person) is completed pursuant to which holders of ordinary shares are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding ordinary shares, (iv) we, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effect any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the ordinary shares or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the ordinary shares are effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) we, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off, merger or scheme of arrangement) with another person or group of persons whereby such other person or group acquires more than 50% of the outstanding ordinary shares (not including any ordinary shares held by the other person or other persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination, each a “Fundamental Transaction,” then the successor entity will succeed to, and be substituted for us, and may exercise every right and power that we may exercise and will assume all of our obligations under the warrants with the same effect as if such successor entity had been named in the warrant itself. If holders of our ordinary shares are given a choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a fundamental transaction, then the holder of warrants shall be given the same choice as to the consideration it receives upon any exercise of the warrants following such fundamental transaction. In addition, the successor entity, at the request of the holders of warrants, will be obligated to purchase any unexercised portion of the warrants in accordance with the terms of such warrants.\n\n_Dividends_. If, at any time while the warrants are outstanding, we declare or make any dividend or other distribution of our assets (or rights to acquire our assets) to holders of our ordinary shares, by way of return of capital or otherwise, then each holder of ordinary shares shall be entitled to participate in such distribution, subject to the beneficial ownership limitations, to the same extent that the holder would have participated therein if the holder had held the number of ordinary shares acquirable upon complete exercise of warrants immediately prior to the record date for such distribution.\n\n_Resale/Registration Rights_. We are required within 45 days of the closing of the offering to file a registration statement providing for the resale of the ordinary shares issued and issuable upon the exercise of the warrants. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration to become effective within 181 days of the closing of the offering and to keep such registration statement effective at all times until no investor owns any warrants or shares issuable upon exercise thereof.\n\n**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**\n\nPursuant to a placement agency agreement dated September 15, 2020, we have engaged Maxim Group LLC, or the placement agent, to act as our exclusive placement agent in connection with this offering of our ordinary shares pursuant to this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. Under the terms of the placement agent agreement, the placement agent has agreed to be our exclusive placement agent, on a commercially reasonable best efforts basis, in connection with the issuance and sale by us of our ordinary shares in this takedown from our shelf registration statement. The terms of this offering were subject to market conditions and negotiations between us, the placement agent and prospective investors. The placement agent agreement does not give rise to any commitment by the placement agent to purchase any of our ordinary shares or the warrants, and the placement agent will have no authority to bind us by virtue of the placement agent agreement. Further, the placement agent does not guarantee that it will be able to raise new capital in any prospective offering.\n\nOn September 15, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) directly with certain institutional investors in connection with this offering. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, from the date of the Purchase Agreement until forty-five (45) days after the closing of the offering, the Company and its subsidiaries shall not issue any ordinary shares or the equivalents or file any registration statement, or amendment or supplement thereto, with the SEC, other this prospectus supplement. Such restriction does not apply to the certain exempt issuances as described in the Purchase Agreement, including the issuances of (i) ordinary shares or options pursuant a properly adopted employee stock option plan of the Company, (ii) securities issued as a result of the exercise of the convertible securities of the Company that are outstanding on the date of the Purchase Agreement, (iii) securities issued in connection with certain strategic acquisitions, and (iv) restricted ordinary shares to up to four non-U.S. persons in connection with a private placement of up to a maximum of $5 million in gross proceeds, which such private placement is subject to certain other conditions and restrictions.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, from the date of the Purchase Agreement until such time as no investor holds any of the warrants issued in the concurrent private placement, the Company shall be prohibited from effecting or entering into an agreement to effect any issuance by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of ordinary shares or ordinary share equivalents involving a Variable Rate Transaction, which means a transaction in which the Company (i) issues or sells any debt or equity securities that are convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or include the right to receive additional ordinary shares either (A) at a conversion price, exercise price or exchange rate or other price that is based upon and/or varies with the trading prices of or quotations for the ordinary shares at any time after the initial issuance of such debt or equity securities, or (B) with a conversion, exercise or exchange price that is subject to being reset at some future date after the initial issuance of such debt or equity security or upon the occurrence of specified or contingent events directly or indirectly related to the business of the Company or the market for the ordinary shares or (ii) enters into, or effects a transaction under, any agreement, including, but not limited to, an equity line of credit or at-the-market offering facility, whereby the Company may issue securities at a future determined price.\n\nWe expect to deliver the ordinary shares being offered pursuant to this prospectus supplement, as well as the warrants offered in the concurrent private placement, on or about September 17, 2020, subject to customary closing conditions.\n\nS-17\n\nWe have agreed to pay the placement agent a total cash fee equal to 7% of the gross proceeds of this offering and $5,000 for non-accountable expenses. We have agreed to reimburse the placement agent for all travel and other out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees, costs and disbursements of its legal fees which shall be limited to, in the aggregate, $25,000. We estimate our total expenses associated with the offering, excluding placement agent fees and expenses, will be approximately $66,000.\n\nThe following table shows per share and total cash placement agent’s fees we will pay to the placement agent in connection with the sale of the ordinary shares pursuant to this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus assuming the purchase of all of the ordinary shares offered hereby:\n\nPer Share | Total  \n---|---  \nOffering Price | $| 0.50 | 6,600,000  \nPlacement Agent’s Fees | $| 0.035 | 462,000  \nProceeds, before expenses, to us | $| 0.465 | 6,138,000  \n  \nAfter deducting certain fees and expenses due to the placement agent and our estimated offering expenses, we expect the net proceeds from this offering to be approximately $6.1 million.\n\n**Indemnification**\n\nWe have agreed to indemnify the placement agent and specified other persons against certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and to contribute to payments that the placement agent may be required to make in respect of such liabilities.\n\nThe placement agent may be deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act, and any commissions received by it, and any profit realized on the resale of the ordinary shares and warrants sold by it while acting as principal, might be deemed to be underwriting discounts or commissions under the Securities Act.

Since this prospectus may not contain all of the information that you may find important, you should review the full text of these documents. If we have filed a contract, agreement or other document as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, you should read the exhibit for a more complete understanding of the document or matter involved. Each statement in this prospectus, including statements incorporated by reference as discussed above, regarding a contract, agreement or other document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual document.\n\nWe are subject to the information reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that are applicable to foreign private issuers, and, in accordance with these requirements, we file annual and current reports and other information with the SEC. You may inspect, read (without charge) and copy the reports and other information we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an internet website at  _www.sec.gov_ that contains our filed reports and other information that we file electronically with the SEC.\n\nWe maintain a corporate website at http://www.colorstarinternational.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute a part of this prospectus.\n\n**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**\n\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability. We were incorporated in the Cayman Islands because of certain benefits associated with being a Cayman Islands corporation, such as political and economic stability, an effective judicial system, a favorable tax system, the absence of foreign exchange control or currency restrictions and the availability of professional and support services. However, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of securities laws that provide significantly less protection to investors as compared to the securities laws of the United States. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the United States.\n\nSubstantially all of our assets are located in Hong Kong. In addition, some of our directors and officers are residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our directors and officers, or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\n\nS-20\n\nAccording to our local Cayman Islands’ counsel, there is uncertainty with regard to Cayman Islands law relating to whether a judgment obtained from the United States or Hong Kong courts under civil liability provisions of the securities laws will be determined by the courts of the Cayman Islands as penal or punitive in nature. If such a determination is made, the courts of the Cayman Islands will not recognize or enforce the judgment against a Cayman Islands’ company. The courts of the Cayman Islands in the past determined that disgorgement proceedings brought at the instance of the Securities and Exchange Commission are penal or punitive in nature and such judgments would not be enforceable in the Cayman Islands. Other civil liability provisions of the securities laws may be characterized as remedial, and therefore enforceable but the Cayman Islands’ Courts have not yet ruled in this regard. Our Cayman Islands’ counsel has further advised us that a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of the United States under which a sum of money is payable other than a sum payable in respect of taxes, fines, penalties or similar charges, may be subject to enforcement proceedings as a debt in the courts of the Cayman Islands.\n\nAs of the date hereof, no treaty or other form of reciprocity exists between the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong governing the recognition and enforcement of judgments.\n\nCayman Islands’ counsel further advised that although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States or Hong Kong, a judgment obtained in such jurisdictions will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment (1) is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction, (2) imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given, (3) is final, (4) is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty, and (5) was not obtained in a manner and is of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands.\n\n**INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES**\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.\n\nS-21\n\n**PROSPECTUS**\n\n**Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.**\n\n**$50,000,000**\n\n**Ordinary Shares, Preferred Shares, Debt Securities**\n\n**Warrants, Units and Rights**\n\nWe may, from time to time in one or more offerings, offer and sell up to $50,000,000 in the aggregate of Ordinary Shares, preferred shares, warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares or preferred shares, debt securities, rights or any combination of the foregoing, either individually or as units comprised of one or more of the other securities.

Under this shelf registration process, we may from time to time sell Ordinary Shares, preferred shares, warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares or preferred shares, debt securities or any combination of the foregoing, either individually or as units comprised of one or more of the other securities, in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $50,000,000. We have provided to you in this prospectus a general description of the securities we may offer. Each time we sell securities under this shelf registration, we will, to the extent required by law, provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of that offering. We may also authorize one or more free writing prospectuses to be provided to you that may contain material information relating to these offerings. The prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus that we may authorize to be provided to you may also add, update or change information contained in this prospectus or in any documents that we have incorporated by reference into this prospectus.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements,” including any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items, any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations, any statements concerning proposed new projects or other developments, any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance, any statements of management’s beliefs, goals, strategies, intentions and objectives, and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. The words “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “potential,” “likely,” “projects,” “continue,” “will,” and “would” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events, are based on assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We cannot guarantee that we actually will achieve the plans, intentions or expectations expressed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on these statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated or implied by forward-looking statements. These important factors include those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and in the applicable prospectus supplement and any free writing prospectus we may authorize for use in connection with a specific offering. These factors and the other cautionary statements made in this prospectus should be read as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements whenever they appear in this prospectus. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n**OUR BUSINESS**\n\n**History and Development of the Company**\n\nHuitao Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly known as China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc.) was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, we changed our name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. in response to a reverse acquisition transaction with BVI-ACM described below.\n\nBVI-ACM was established on October 9, 2007, under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. The majority shareholders of BVI-ACM also control Xin Ao, a limited liability company formed under laws of China through a series of agreements. BVI-ACM was established as a “special purpose vehicle” for foreign fund raising for Xin Ao. China State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, requires the owners of any Chinese companies to obtain SAFE’s approval before establishing any offshore holding company structure for foreign financing as well as subsequent acquisition matters. On September 29, 2007, BVI-ACM was approved by local Chinese SAFE as a “special purpose vehicle” offshore company.\n\nOn November 23, 2007, BVI-ACM established a subsidiary, China-ACMH, in China as a wholly owned foreign limited liability company with registered capital of $5 million. Through China-ACMH and its variable interest entity Xin Ao, we were solely engaged in producing general ready-mixed concrete, customized mechanical refining concrete, and some other concrete-related products which are mainly sold in China.\n\nOn April 29, 2008, we completed a reverse acquisition transaction with BVI-ACM to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of BVI-ACM. BVI-ACM thereby became our wholly owned subsidiary and the former stockholders of BVI-ACM became our controlling stockholders.\n\nOn September 20, 2010, China ACMH established a 100% owned subsidiary, Advanced Investment Holdings Co., Inc., or AIH, in the State of Nevada. AIH never engaged in operations and the Company subsequently dissolved AIH on August 30, 2011.\n\nOn August 1, 2013, we consummated a reincorporation merger pursuant to which we merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Nevada corporation and the surviving entity in the merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into as of August 1, 2013. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company became governed by the laws of the state of Nevada.\n\nOn August 20, 2018, CACM Group NY, Inc. (“CACM”) was incorporated in the State of New York and is wholly owned by us. The establishment of CACM was to expand the Company’s business in the U.S. As of the date of the report, CACM has not commenced any operations.\n\nOn December 31, 2018, we consummated a re-domicile merger pursuant to which we merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Cayman Islands company and the surviving entity in the merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger adopted in July 2018. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company is now governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nOn June 27, 2019, upon effectiveness of the Company amendment and restatement of the Company’s memorandum and articles of association which was approved by the Company’s shareholders, the Company’s name was changed from China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. to Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn February 14, 2020, the Company consummated the acquisition of Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“**Sunway Kids** ”) whereby we issued 1,989,262 Ordinary Shares and $2 million cash in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sunway Kids. The $2 million cash consideration is payable in five installments over five years according to certain earn-out schedule. Sunway Kids thereby became our wholly owned subsidiary.\n\n2\n\nSunway Kids was established on February 29, 2012, under the laws of the British Virgin Islands as an offshore holding company. On August 23, 2018, Sunway Kids established its wholly owned subsidiary, Brave Millenium Limited (“**Brave Millenium** ”) under the laws of Hong Kong. On December 4, 2019, Brave Millenium established Chengdu Hengshanghui Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. (“**Chengdu Hengshanghui** ”) in China as a wholly foreign owned limited liability company. On December 9, 2019, Chengdu Hengshanghui entered into a series of variable interest entity agreements with Chengdu Hengshanghui Education Consulting Co., Ltd. (“**Hengshanghui Education** ”). Through Sunway Kids and its variable interest entity Hengshanghui Education, we are engaged in providing education and health services to day-cares and preschools in China.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\n_Ready-Mixed Concrete Business_\n\nOur concrete sales business is comprised of the formulation, production and delivery of the Company’s line of C10-C100 concrete mixtures primarily through our current fixed plant, a ready mix concrete batching plant in Beijing. The ready-mixed concrete sales business engages principally in the formulation, preparation and delivery of ready-mixed concrete to the worksites of our customers. We procure raw materials, mix them according to our measured mixing formula, ship the final products in mounted transit mixers to the destination work site, and, for more sophisticated structures, pump the mixture and set it into structural frame molds as per structural design parameters. The process of delivering and setting the ready mix concrete mixture cannot exceed 90 minutes because the chemistry of concrete mixture hardens thereafter. The deliverable radius of a concrete mixture from our ready mix plant in Beijing is approximately 25 kilometers. Traffic conditions would affect the timing and shipment of our concrete mixtures. Since the 2008 Olympics, there are alternating license plate traffic restrictions on many traffic routes in Beijing to ease traffic congestion and associated exhaust pollution. Due to the large amounts of working capital required for the acquisition of raw materials, a supply shortage or degradation of supplier accounts payable credit terms would pose a potential risk to our business.\n\nOur Industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The concrete products industry experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years. . In 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down.\n\nAs a result of the continued decline in the concrete business, management explored possibility to divert its business to other concrete related sectors. However, it turned out the industry-wide recession makes it very difficult, if possible, to turn around the business in a cost-efficient manner. As such, management then started to explore opportunities in other industry, including acquisition of business or assets.\n\n_Early Childhood Education Service Business_\n\nManagement started to get in touch with Sunway Kids around September 2019. Sunway Kids is an education service provider to day-care and preschools in China. Sunway Kids has a highly skilled professional team experienced in early childhood development. It provides a well-structured system for early childhood education, including AI and robotic technologies, intellectual campus administration software as a service system (“**SAAS System** ”) and online education courses for kids and parents. Sunway Kids provides personalized growth plans for each child based on the analysis of performance data. Sunway Kids helps schools in increasing their education quality as well as generating derivative revenues by providing targeted courses and AI lessons for kids. Sunway Kids believes its ability to cooperate closely with various schools and research institutes in China has contributed to its significant position in the industry.\n\nManagement believes that the convergence of artificial intelligence and education is an emerging and high growth industry. According to Deloitte’s estimation in its 2018 China Education Development Report (Deloitte China Report), China’s education market will reach RMB2.68 trillion (approximately US$383 billion) by 2018 with training organizations, Kto12 and Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) education and private kindergartens comprising the three largest segments. The total scale of private education is expected to reach RMB3.36 trillion (approximately US$480 billion) by 2020 and approach RMB5 trillion (approximately US$714 billion) by 2025 with an annual growth rate (AGR) of 10.8%. Concurrently, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in education is estimated to grow substantially with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 51% from 2018 to 2024 in the Asia Pacific region, with China leading investments in technology and accounting for 17% of the global external investments in AI (Global Market Insights, Asia Pacific in 2019). Specifically, China’s government is building awareness and knowledge of AI through its emphasis on “data and information” and has begun to proactively include AI education into K-12 schools (Deloitte China Report). We believe that the use of artificial intelligence in education will continue to expand in terms of industry scale and market activity in the near future due to a combination of supportive government policies, increased digitalization activities and increased investment by Chinese players in the region.\n\nWith the introduction of the national two-child policy in China since 2015, the birth rate has been increasing and thus provides a guaranteed increase in opportunity for the preschool education industry. With the deepening of China’s economic reforms, the disposable income of urban residents has continued to increase. With the improvement of living standards of urban residents, families have become more willing to invest in education, training, and other services for their children starting at a young age, and at the same time have begun to attach more importance to the branding of the education. At present, China’s preschool education and intelligent education markets are highly fragmented, small in scale, independent, and loosely managed. Branding and franchising will therefore become the inevitable trend of development in the intelligent education industry. Management believes with its experience in AI technology and the Company’s advantage as a U.S. public company, acquisition of Sunway Kids will increase revenue and create value for our shareholders.\n\nAs such, the Company entered into a letter of intent with Sunway Kids and its shareholders on October 31, 2019 for a potential acquisition. On December 31, 2019, we entered into certain Share Exchange Agreement with Sunway Kids and its shareholders. The acquisition was consummated on February 14, 2020.\n\nSunway Kids provides its products and services to kindergartens, vocational schools, training schools and other education institutions. Its current products and services are categorized as follows: (1) U Campus SAAS System; (2) Childhood AI Analysis Service; (3) Targeted Teaching Programs Consulting Service for Preschool Children; and (4) Online Education Service.\n\n3\n\n_U Campus SAAS System_\n\nSunway Kids provides a smart school management SAAS System with U Campus, an online service that provides a package of comprehensive support for the operation and management of preschool education institutions, including student management, employee management, financial management, attendance management and health management. Through U Campus, subscribers are able to handle essential school functions such as adding new classes, enrolling new students and receiving tuition, all online in one place.\n\nU Campus is constantly maintained and updated by Shenzhen Qianhai Peiwen Technology Co., Ltd., our contracted third-party service provider, to provide effective, intuitive, and secure services to our subscribers.\n\n_Childhood AI Analysis Service_\n\nSunway Kids provides schools with monitoring equipment which utilizes AI technology to record and analyze key information about the children in real time, such as emotions, movement, concentration and points of interest. The information is automatically compiled into intuitive data reports that are used to create targeted teaching programs for the children to maximize effectiveness.\n\n_Targeted Teaching Programs Consulting Service for Preschool Children_\n\nThe data reports generated from the AI monitoring equipment are provided to Sichuan Lanjingling Enterprise Management Co., Ltd. (“**Lanjingling** ”), our contracted third-party service provider, which then creates customized curriculum based on the data in the reports. Sunway Kids sells the customized curriculum back to the schools.\n\n_Online Education Service_\n\nSunway Kids offers an English as a Second Language (“**ESL** ”) curriculum named Precise Mind (“**Precise Mind** ”) to kindergartens in China, supplementing their existing English curriculum. The Precise Mind curriculum is divided into multiple levels, each tailored to a specific age group of children and their learning levels. Precise Mind is designed to educate children from a young age with ESL while including fun and engaging activities that create an enjoyable and effective teaching structure for the children. Precise Mind offers online lessons taught by professional native English speaking ESL teachers, who are contracted from Lanjingling. These teachers provide live broadcasted English lessons that last for 45 minutes per session and are usually held 1 to 2 times per week. Through combining our Precise Mind curriculum with each school’s existing English curriculum, we believe students have been able to achieve outstanding results.:\n\nSunway Kids has generated approximately $935,000 of revenue and $263,000 of net income as of December 31, 2019, although these numbers are unaudited.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates our current corporate structure:\n\n![](image_002.jpg)\n\n**_Corporate Information_**\n\nOur principal executive office is located on the 9 North West Fourth Ring Road, Yingu Mansion Ste 1708, Haidian District, Beijing 100190. Our telephone number is +86 10 82525361. We maintain a website at www.china-acm.com that contains information about our Company, though no information contained on our website is part of this prospectus.\n\n4\n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth under “Risk Factors” described in our most recent annual report on Form 20-F, filed on November 15, 2019, as supplemented and updated by subsequent current reports on Form 6-K that we have filed with the SEC, together with all other information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement and in any related free writing prospectus in connection with a specific offering, before making an investment decision. Each of the risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects, as well as the value of an investment in our securities, and the occurrence of any of these risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\n\nIn addition to the risk factors referenced above, as described in our most recent annual report on Form 20-F, we want to disclose the additional risk factors below.\n\n**Risks Related to our Acquisition of Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd.**\n\n**_We may not be able to oversee the combined entity efficiently._**\n\nWe may not be able to oversee the combined entity efficiently, realize anticipated profits or effectively implement our growth and operating strategies. We are now managing two unrelated businesses which are not synergistic and have completely different customers, suppliers, and competition landscapes. This involves risks that could adversely affect our operating results due to uncertainties involved with the new business, diversion of management’s attention in operating the new business. There can be no guarantee that the addition of the new business will not cause us to incur additional debt and increase our exposure to market and other risks. Our failure to successfully pursue our strategies or effectively operate the combined entity could also have a material adverse effect on our rate of growth and operating performance.\n\n**Risks Related to our Education Service Business**\n\n**_Our education service revenue model depends on developing a subscriber base of users. If we fail to reach a critical mass of subscribers, our net revenues may decline, and we may not be able to implement our business plan._**\n\nWe expect to generate revenue primarily from the fees we collect from our users. It is critical for us to enroll subscribers in a cost-effective manner. Some of the factors, many of which are largely beyond our control, could prevent us from successfully increasing subscriptions in a cost-effective manner, or at all. These factors include, among other things, (i) reduced interest in the products and services we offer; (ii) negative publicity or perceptions regarding us, or electronic education services in general; (iii) the emergence of alternative technologies not offered by us; (iv) the inability of subscribers to pay the fees; (v) increasing market competition, particularly price reductions by competitors that we are unable or unwilling to match; and (vi) adverse changes in relevant government policies or general economic conditions. If one or more of these factors reduce market demand for our services, our subscriber base could be negatively affected or our costs associated with subscriber acquisition and retention could increase, or both, any of which could materially affect our ability to grow our gross billings and net revenues. These developments could also harm our brand and reputation, which would negatively impact our ability to establish or expand our business.\n\n**_Our education service business and growth will be highly dependent on the development of AI childhood education industries in China._**\n\nMainland China is a key driver of revenues and growth in our business plan. Our business plan assumes that we will be able to successfully develop our AI childhood education business in mainland China. The evolution of the AI childhood education is affected by a number of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\n(1) | Penetration and usage by schools, teachers, parents and students, as well as government support over AI childhood education, in relation to its related products and services;  \n---|---  \n(2) | The availability, reliability and security of AI childhood education platforms;  \n---|---  \n(3) | The growth of broadband and advanced technology, including mobile internet and 5G;  \n---|---  \n(4) | The emergence of alternative business models that better suits or becomes a substitute which suits the needs of consumers in the countries we serve; and  \n---|---  \n(5) | Changes in laws and regulations, as well as government policies that govern the AI childhood education industry.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf the AI childhood education industries fail to develop as anticipated in China, our ability to grow our AI childhood education business may be materially and adversely affected.\n\n5\n\n**_We expect to invest in our growth for the foreseeable future. If we fail to manage this growth effectively, the success of our business model will be compromised._**\n\nWe anticipate rapid growth in gross billings and net revenues upon the acquisition of our AI childhood education business segment, which growth is expected to be driven primarily by the growth of our subscriber base. Rapid growth may place a significant strain on our sales and marketing capacities, administrative and operating infrastructure, facilities and other resources. To manage our anticipated our growth, we may need to continue to acquire more subscribers, scale up our product and service offerings, as well as strengthen our platforms and systems. We will also be required to refine our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to efficiently manage the establishment and future expansion of our business, our costs and expenses may increase more than we plan and we may not successfully attract a sufficient number of subscribers and strategic partners in a cost-effective manner, respond to competitive challenges, or otherwise execute our business plans. In addition, we may, as part of carrying out our growth strategies, adopt new initiatives to offer additional educational content and to implement new pricing models and strategies. We cannot assure you that these initiatives may achieve the anticipated results. These proposed changes may not be well received by our existing and prospective users, in which case their experience with our education services may suffer, which could damage our reputation and business prospects.\n\nOur ability to effectively implement our strategies and manage any significant growth of our business will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to: (i) identify and effectively market our products and services in new markets with sufficient growth potential; (ii) develop and improve service and product offerings to make them appealing to our users; (iii) maintain and increase our subscriber base; (iv) effectively recruit, train and motivate a large number of new employees, including sales and marketing personnel; (v) successfully implement enhancements and improvements to the systems and platforms; (vi) continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and efficiencies; (vii) protect and further develop our intellectual property rights; and (viii) make sound business decisions in light of the scrutiny associated with operating as a public company. These activities require significant capital expenditures and investment of valuable management and financial resources, and our growth will continue to place significant demands on our management. There are no guarantees that we will be able to effectively manage any future growth in an efficient, cost-effective and timely manner, or at all. If we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, our reputation, results of operations and overall business and prospects could be negatively impacted.\n\n**_We expect to rely heavily on information and technology to operate our existing and future education products and services, and any cybersecurity incident or other disruption to our AI and technology infrastructure could result in the loss of critical confidential information or adversely impact our reputation, business or results of operations._**\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and to compete effectively depends in part upon the satisfactory performance and reliability of our technology network, including the ability to provide features of services that are important to our customers and to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers. We also rely on our technology to maintain and process various operating and financial data that are essential to the day-to-day operation of our business (i.e. AI Classroom) and formulation of our development strategies. Our business operations and growth prospects depend on our ability to maintain and make timely and cost-effective enhancements and upgrades to our technology system and to introduce innovative additions that can meet changing operational needs in future. Therefore, we expect to continue to invest in advanced information technology and any equipment to enhance operational efficiency and reliability as we grow. Accordingly, any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our IT infrastructure could damage our reputation, decrease user satisfaction and retention, adversely impact our ability to attract new users and expand our service and product offerings, and materially disrupt our operations. If any of these occur, our business operations, reputation and prospects could be harmed.\n\n**_If our security measures are breached or fail and result in unauthorized disclosure of data by our employees or our third-party agents, we could lose existing subscribers, fail to attract new subscribers and be exposed to protracted and costly litigation._**\n\nMaintaining platform security is of critical importance to our subscribers because the platform stores and transmits proprietary and confidential information, which may include sensitive personally identifiable information that may be subject to stringent legal and regulatory obligations. As an electronic education service provider, we face an increasing number of threats to our IT infrastructure, including unauthorized activity and access by our employees or third-party agents, system viruses, worms, malicious code and organized cyber-attacks, which could breach our security and disrupt our business. We hope to introduce data security and confidentiality protocols into the cooperation agreements we enter into with third-party sales agents with whom we share prospective subscribers’ contact information. As we expand, we hope to invest in improving our technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans to prevent unauthorized access of confidential or sensitive personal information by our employees and third-party sales agents in the process of engaging prospective subscribers.\n\nThese measures, however, may not be as effective as we anticipate. In addition, there is no assurance that our third-party sales agents will comply with contractual and legal requirements with respect to data privacy when they collect data from our prospective customers. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, we could be subject to liability or our business could be interrupted, potentially over an extended period of time. Any or all of these issues could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to attract and enroll prospective subscribers, cause prospective subscribers not to enroll or stay enrolled, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability. Further, any reputational damage resulting from breach of our security measures could create distrust of our company by prospective subscribers or investors. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of these disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such disruptions or breaches.\n\n6\n\n**_Privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our user data and disclosure of user data could adversely impact our business and reputation._**\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business and in particular in connection with conducting sales and marketing activities with our existing and prospective subscribers as well as the utilization of our AI-powered platform programs, we collect and utilize data supplied by our users. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our users in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results.\n\nInternationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\n**_We face risks associated with uncertainties surrounding PRC laws and regulations governing the education industry in general, including the Law for Promoting Private Education and its Implementation Rules._**\n\nPursuant to the Administrative Regulations on Educational Websites and Online and Distance Education Schools promulgated by the Ministry of Education of the PRC, or the MOE, on July 5, 2000, “educational websites and online education schools” that provide educational services in relation to higher education, elementary education, pre-school education, teaching education, occupational education, adult and other education and public educational information services, are subject to approval from competent education authorities, depending on the type of education service provided. In February 2016, the State Council issued a government decision which explicitly withdrew the above-mentioned approval requirement. On November 7, 2016, China’s National People’s Congress passed an amendment to the Promotion of Private Education Law, or the Amendment, which became effective on September 1, 2017. The Amendment applies different regulatory requirements to non-profit and for-profit private schools.\n\nIn December 2016, several PRC government agencies, including the MOE, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, or the SAIC, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Welfare, jointly promulgated the Implementation Rules on the Supervision and Administration of For-profit Private Schools, or the Implementation Rules. Under the Implementation Rules, the establishment, division, merger or any other material change in a for-profit private school shall be approved by the competent education authorities or the authorities in charge of labor and social welfare and be registered with the competent local branch of SAIC, and a duly approved private school will be granted a private school operating permit. The Implementation Rules also provide that the provisions contained therein should be applicable to “for-profit private training institutions” in an analogous manner.\n\nAs of the date of this current report, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to any penalties or disciplinary action from government authorities due to our lack of a private school operating permit for our electronic education services. Nonetheless, the current PRC laws and regulations, including the Amendment and the Implementation Rules, remain unclear as to whether the requirement for a private school operating permit is applicable to an electronic education service provider. We cannot assure you that the PRC government will not in the future require us to obtain a private school operating permit, given the lack of clear and consistent statutory interpretation regarding the implementation of the Amendment and the Implementation Rules and other relevant laws and regulations. If the PRC government requires us to obtain a private school operating permit or introduces additional amendments and guidelines to expand the coverage of the Amendment to explicitly cover electronic education service providers, and if we fail to do so, we may be subject to fines up to five times the illegitimate gains generated from the provision of training services without a proper license, other administrative sanctions, such as being ordered to refund payments to users, or criminal liabilities, for our lack of a private school operating permit. In addition, uncertainties exist as new laws and regulations, including without limitation the for review draft of Implementation Rules of the Promotion of Private Education Law, or the draft Implementation Rules, published by the Ministry of Justice in August, 2018, may require online education service providers to obtain private school operating permit or make filing with its competent provincial department of education or department of human resources and social security. It is uncertain when the draft would be signed into law and whether the final version would have any substantial changes from the draft. If enacted as the draft, we may be unable to obtain the private school operating permit or complete the required filing in a prompt manner or incur additional costs in complying with relevant requirements, which may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. We may also be subject to regulatory requirements that are more stringent than the ones currently applicable to us, including those relating to sales and marketing, courses and educational content offerings, teachers’ qualification, as well as tuition fee rates and tuition refund policies, or laws and regulations that require us to obtain and maintain additional licenses and permits, and we may incur substantial expenses or alter or change our business to comply with these requirements. If any of the foregoing were to happen, our business operations may be disrupted, and our financial condition, results of operations and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.\n\n7\n\n**_We face regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to the licensing requirement for the online transmission of internet audio-visual programs._**\n\nOn December 20, 2007, the National Radio and Television Administration fka known as the State Administration of Press Publication Radio Film and Television, or SAPPRFT, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, jointly promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Internet Audio Visual Program Services, or the Audio Visual Program Provisions, which became effective on January 31, 2008 and were amended on August 28, 2015. Among other things, the Audio Visual Program Provisions stipulate that no entities or individuals may provide Internet audio-visual program services without a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs issued by SAPPRFT or completing the relevant filing with SAPPRFT or its local bureaus, and only state-owned or state-controlled entities are eligible to apply for a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs. On April 1, 2010, SAPPRFT promulgated the Provisional Implementations of Tentative Categories of Internet Audio Visual Program Services, or the Categories, which clarified the scope of Internet audio-visual programs services, which was amended on March 10, 2017. According to the Categories, there are four categories of Internet audio-visual program services which are further divided into seventeen sub-categories. Sub-category No. 3 to the second category covers the making and editing of certain specialized audio-visual programs concerning, among other things, educational content, and broadcasting such content to the general public online. Sub-category No. 5 of the first category and sub-category No. 7 of the second category cover the live broadcasting of important political, martial, economic, social, cultural, sports activities or events or general social or community cultural activities, sports games and other organized activities. However, there are still significant uncertainties relating to the interpretation and implementation of the Audio Visual Program Provisions, in particular, the scope of “internet audio-visual programs.” See “Regulations Relating to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs.”\n\nWe plan to deliver our courses in live streaming format. Our teachers and students communicate and interact live with each other via our virtual learning community. The audio and video data will likely be transmitted through the platforms between specific recipients instantly without any further redaction. We believe the nature of the raw data we transmit will distinguish us from general providers of internet audio-visual program services, such as the operator of online video websites, and the provision of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions are not applicable with regard to our offering of the courses. However, we cannot assure you that the competent PRC government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to our opinion. In addition, we also plan to offer video recordings of live streaming courses and certain other audio-video contents on our electronic platforms to our students as supplementary course materials on our platforms. If the government authorities determine that our offering of the courses fall within the relevant category of Internet audio-visual program services under the Categories, we may be required to obtain the License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs.\n\nThe Categories describe “Internet audio-visual program services” in a very broad, vague manner and are unclear as to whether electronic courses, whether delivered in a live streaming format or through video recordings, fall into the definition of audio-visual programs. We have made inquiries to the relevant bureaus of SAPPRFT and were informed that online educational content provided through live streaming or recorded courses does not fall within the scope of internet audio-visual programs, the transmission of which does not require a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs. We cannot assure you that the PRC government will not ultimately take a view that live streaming or recorded courses or any other content offered on our platforms are subject to the Audio Visual Program Provisions. We currently do not hold a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs, and since we are not a state-owned or state-controlled entity, we are not eligible to apply for such license. If the PRC government determines that our content should be considered as “internet audio- visual programs” for the purpose of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, we may be required to obtain a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs. We are, however, not eligible apply for such license since we are not a state-owned or state-controlled entity. If this were to occur, we may be subject to penalties, fines, legal sanctions or an order to suspend the provision of our live streaming courses. As of the date of this annual report, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities regarding the lack of a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs in conducting of our business.\n\n**_Our failure to obtain and maintain approvals, licenses or permits applicable to our business could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations._**\n\nA number of PRC regulatory authorities, such as the SAIC, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the MITT, the National Radio and Television Administration, and the State Council Information Office, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Welfare, oversee different aspects of our business operations. We may be required in the future to obtain additional government approvals, licenses and permits in connection with our operations.\n\nBy way of example, depending upon regulatory interpretation, under the current PRC laws and regulations, the provision of our educational content through our electronic platform may be considered “online publishing” and may require us to obtain an Internet Publishing License, which we currently do not have.\n\nAs of the date of this registration statement, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities regarding the lack of any the above-mentioned approvals, licenses or permits. However, we cannot guarantee that the government authorities will not impose any penalties or sanctions on us in the future, which may include warnings, fines, mandates to remedy any violations, confiscation of the gains derived from the services for which approvals, licenses or permits are required, and/or an order to cease to provide such services. In addition, we cannot guarantee that the government will not promulgate new laws and regulations that require additional licenses, permits and/or approvals for the operation of any of our existing or future business. If we are unable to obtain such licenses, permits, or approvals in a timely fashion, we could be subject to penalties and operational disruption and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n8\n\n**_We face intense competition which could adversely affect our results of operations and market share._**\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is sensitive to price, content (i.e. curriculum) and quality of service. Some of our competitors may have more financial resources, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do, or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to raise capital and enter into strategic relationships more easily. We also compete with leading domestic supplier companies based on a number of factors including business model, operational capabilities, cost control and service quality, as well as in-house delivery capabilities to serve their logistics needs and compete with us.\n\nWe are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that affect many other businesses, include but not limited to:\n\n(1) | Increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare benefits;  \n---|---  \n(2) | The increasing costs of compliance with federal, state and foreign governmental agency mandates;  \n---|---  \n(3) | Any impacts on our business resulting from new domestic and international government laws and regulation;  \n---|---  \n(4) | Market conditions in the AI childhood education industry or the economy as a whole;  \n---|---  \n(5) | Market acceptance of our new service and growth initiatives;  \n---|---  \n(6) | Announcements of the introduction of new products and services by our competitors;  \n---|---  \n(7) | The impact of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our products and services;  \n---|---  \n(8) | Developments concerning current or future strategic collaborations;  \n---|---  \n(9) | Widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf we are unable to respond to these changing market conditions, our business and financial results may be materially affected.\n\n**_We face risks related to health epidemics that could impact our sales and operating results._**\n\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Any outbreak of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, particularly in China, could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. These could include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers. Any disruption or delay of our suppliers, manufacturers or customers would likely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of China and many other countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect the value of RMB, demand for our products and significantly impact our operating results.\n\n**USE OF PROCEEDS**\n\nExcept as described in any prospectus supplement and any free writing prospectus in connection with a specific offering, we currently intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities offered under this prospectus to fund the development and commercialization of our projects and the growth of our business, primarily working capital, and for general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in technologies, products and/or businesses that we believe will enhance the value of our Company, although we have no current commitments or agreements with respect to any such transactions as of the date of this prospectus. We have not determined the amount of net proceeds to be used specifically for the foregoing purposes. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of any sale of the securities. If a material part of the net proceeds is to be used to repay indebtedness, we will set forth the interest rate and maturity of such indebtedness in a prospectus supplement. Pending use of the net proceeds will be deposited in interest bearing bank accounts. \n\n**DILUTION**\n\nIf required, we will set forth in a prospectus supplement the following information regarding any material dilution of the equity interests of investors purchasing securities in an offering under this prospectus:\n\n● | the net tangible book value per share of our equity securities before and after the offering;   \n---|---  \n● | the amount of the increase in such net tangible book value per share attributable to the cash payments made by purchasers in the offering; and   \n● | the amount of the immediate dilution from the public offering price which will be absorbed by such purchasers.   \n  \n9\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF SHARE CAPITAL**\n\nThe following description of our capital stock (which includes a description of securities we may offer pursuant to the registration statement of which this prospectus, as the same may be supplemented, forms a part) does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (“M&A”) and by the applicable provisions of Cayman Islands law.\n\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 75,000,000 Ordinary Shares. As of February 25, 2020, there were 9,563,888 Ordinary Shares and no preferred shares outstanding.\n\nThe following description of our capital stock is intended as a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our M&A, which have been filed previously with the SEC, and applicable provisions of Cayman Islands law.\n\nWe, directly or through agents, dealers or underwriters designated from time to time, may offer, issue and sell, together or separately, up to $50,000,000 in the aggregate of:\n\n●| ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n●| preferred shares;  \n---|---  \n●| secured or unsecured debt securities consisting of notes, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness which may be senior debt securities, senior subordinated debt securities or subordinated debt securities, each of which may be convertible into equity securities;  \n---|---  \n●| warrants to purchase our securities;  \n---|---  \n●| rights to purchase our securities; or  \n---|---  \n●| units comprised of, or other combinations of, the foregoing securities.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe may issue the debt securities as exchangeable for or convertible into Ordinary Shares, preferred shares or other securities. The preferred shares may also be exchangeable for and/or convertible into Ordinary Shares, another series of preferred shares or other securities. The debt securities, the preferred shares, the Ordinary Shares and the warrants are collectively referred to in this prospectus as the “securities.” When a particular series of securities is offered, a supplement to this prospectus will be delivered with this prospectus, which will set forth the terms of the offering and sale of the offered securities.\n\n**Ordinary Shares**\n\nAs of February 25, 2020, there were 9,563,888 Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding, held of record by approximately 390 shareholders. We have never paid dividends on our Ordinary Shares. While any future dividends will be determined by our directors after consideration of the earnings, financial condition, and other relevant factors, it is currently expected that available cash resources will be utilized in connection with our ongoing operations.\n\nEach outstanding Ordinary Share entitles the holder thereof to one vote per share on all matters. Our M&A provide that elections for directors shall be by a plurality of votes. Shareholders do not have preemptive rights to purchase shares in any future issuance of our Ordinary Shares. Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and after payment of creditors and preferred shareholders, if any, our assets will be divided pro-rata on a share-for-share basis among the holders of the Ordinary Shares.\n\nThe holders of our Ordinary Shares are entitled to dividends out of funds legally available when and as declared by our board of directors (the “Board”). The Board has never declared a dividend and does not anticipate declaring a dividend in the foreseeable future. Should we decide in the future to pay dividends, as a holding company, our ability to do so and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including as a result of restrictive covenants in loan agreements, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive, ratably, the net assets available to stockholders after payment of all creditors.\n\n_Transfer of Ordinary Shares_\n\nSubject to the restrictions set out below, any of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his, its or her Ordinary Shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or any other form approved by the Board or in a form prescribed by the stock exchange on which our shares are then listed.\n\nThe Board may, in its sole discretion, decline to register any transfer of Ordinary Shares whether or not it is fully paid up to the total consideration paid for such shares. The Board may also decline to register any transfer of any Ordinary Shares if (a) the instrument of transfer is not accompanied by the certificate covering the shares to which it relates or any other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor to, or his/her right to transfer the shares; or (b) the instrument of transfer is in respect of more than one class of shares.\n\n10\n\nIf the Board refuses to register a transfer, they shall, within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to the transferee notice of such refusal.\n\nThe registration of transfers may be suspended and the register closed at such times and for such periods as the Board may from time to time determine, provided, however, that the registration of transfers shall not be suspended nor the register closed for more than 30 days in any year.\n\n_Winding-Up/Liquidation_\n\nOn a return of capital on winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares), a liquidator may be appointed to determine how to distribute the assets among the holders of the Ordinary Shares. If our assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay all of the paid-up capital, the assets will be distributed so that the losses are borne by our shareholders proportionately; a similar basis will be employed if the assets are more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital at the commencement of the winding up.\n\n_Calls on Ordinary Shares and Forfeiture of Ordinary Shares_\n\nThe Board may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their Ordinary Shares in a notice served to such shareholders at least 14 days prior to the specified time and place of payment. The shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid on the specified time are subject to forfeiture.\n\n_Redemption of Shares_\n\nWe may issue shares on terms that are subject to redemption, at our option or at the option of the holders, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by the Board.\n\n_Variations of Rights of Shares_\n\nAll or any of the special rights attached to any class of shares may, be varied with the resolution of at least two thirds of the issued shares of that class or a resolution passed at a general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class present in person or by proxy or with the consent in writing of the holders of at least two-thirds of the issued shares of that class.\n\n_Inspection of Books and Records_\n\nThe Board shall from time to time determine whether and to what extent and at what times and places and under what conditions or regulations the accounts and books of the Company or any of them shall be open to the inspection of members not on the Board and no member (not on the Board) shall have any right of inspecting any account or book or document of the Company except as conferred by Companies Law or authorized by the Board or by the Company in a general meeting. However, the Board shall from time to time cause to be prepared and to be laid before the Company in a general meeting, profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, group accounts (if any) and such other reports and accounts as may be required by Companies Law. (See “Where You Can Find More Information”)\n\n_Issuance of Additional Shares_\n\nOur M&A authorizes the Board to issue additional Ordinary Shares from time to time as the Board shall determine, to the extent there are available authorized but unissued shares.\n\nIssuance of additional shares may dilute the voting power of holders of Ordinary Shares. However, our M&A provides for authorized share capital comprising Ordinary Shares and to the extent the rights attached to any class may be varied, the Company must comply with the provisions in the M&A relating to variations to rights of shares.\n\n_Exempted Company_\n\nWe are an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Law. The Companies Law distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. A Cayman Islands exempted company:\n\n● | is a company that conducts its business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands;  \n---|---  \n● | is exempted from certain requirements of the Companies Law, including the filing an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies or the Immigration Board;  \n● | does not have to make its register of members open for inspection;  \n● | does not have to hold an annual general meeting;  \n  \n11\n\n● | may issue negotiable or bearer shares or shares with no par value (subject to the provisions of the Companies Law);  \n---|---  \n● | may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for 20 years in the first instance); and  \n● | may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands.  \n  \n_Register of Members_\n\nUnder Cayman Islands law, we must keep a register of members and there should be entered therein:\n\n● | the names and addresses of the members, a statement of the shares held by each member, and of the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid, on the shares of each member;  \n---|---  \n● | the date on which the name of any person was entered on the register as a member; and  \n● | the date on which any person ceased to be a member.  \n  \nUnder Cayman Islands law, the register of members of our Company is prima facie evidence of the matters set out therein (i.e. the register of members will raise a presumption of fact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted) and a member registered in the register of members is deemed as a matter of Cayman Islands law to have legal title to the shares as set against its name in the register of members. Once our register of members has been updated, the shareholders recorded in the register of members are deemed to have legal title to the shares set against their name.\n\nIf the name of any person is incorrectly entered in, or omitted from, our register of members, or if there is any default or unnecessary delay in entering on the register the fact of any person having ceased to be a member of our Company, the person or member aggrieved (or any member of our Company or our Company itself) may apply to the Cayman Islands Grand Court for an order that the register be rectified, and the Court may either refuse such application or it may, if satisfied of the justice of the case, make an order for the rectification of the register.\n\n_Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability_\n\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our M&A requires us to indemnify our officers and directors for actions, proceedings, claims, losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (“Indemnified Losses”) incurred in their capacities as such unless such Indemnified Losses arise from dishonesty of such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\n\n**Preferred Shares**\n\nAs all the current authorized share capital is designated as Ordinary Shares, shareholders’ special resolution will be needed to amend the Company’s M&A to alter its authorized share capital if the Company decides to issue preferred shares. After such resolution and amendment, the Board is empowered to allot and/or issue (with or without rights of renunciation), grant options over, offer or otherwise deal with or dispose of any unissued shares of the Company (whether forming part of the original or any increased share capital), either at a premium or at par, with or without preferred, deferred or other special rights or restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, return of capital or otherwise and to such persons, on such terms and conditions, and at such times as the Board may decide and they may allot or otherwise dispose of them to such persons (including any director of the Board) on such terms and conditions and at such time as the Board may determine.\n\nYou should refer to the prospectus supplement relating to the series of preferred shares being offered for the specific terms of that series, including:\n\n●| title of the series and the number of shares in the series;  \n---|---  \n●| the price at which the preferred shares will be offered;  \n---|---  \n●| the dividend rate or rates or method of calculating the rates, the dates on which the dividends will be payable, whether or not dividends will be cumulative or noncumulative and, if cumulative, the dates from which dividends on the preferred shares being offered will cumulate;  \n---|---  \n●| the voting rights, if any, of the holders of preferred shares being offered;  \n---|---  \n  \n12\n\n●| the provisions for a sinking fund, if any, and the provisions for redemption, if applicable, of the preferred shares being offered, including any restrictions on the foregoing as a result of arrearage in the payment of dividends or sinking fund installments;  \n---|---  \n●| the liquidation preference per share;  \n---|---  \n●| the terms and conditions, if applicable, upon which the preferred shares being offered will be convertible into our Ordinary Shares, including the conversion price, or the manner of calculating the conversion price, and the conversion period;  \n---|---  \n●| the terms and conditions, if applicable, upon which the preferred shares being offered will be exchangeable for debt securities, including the exchange price, or the manner of calculating the exchange price, and the exchange period;  \n---|---  \n●| any listing of the preferred shares being offered on any securities exchange;  \n---|---  \n●| a discussion of any material federal income tax considerations applicable to the preferred shares being offered;  \n---|---  \n●| any preemptive rights;  \n---|---  \n●| the relative ranking and preferences of the preferred shares being offered as to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or the winding up of our affairs;  \n---|---  \n●| any limitations on the issuance of any class or series of preferred shares ranking senior or equal to the series of preferred shares being offered as to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or the winding up of our affairs; and  \n---|---  \n●| any additional rights, preferences, qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the series.  \n---|---  \n  \nUpon issuance, the preferred shares will be fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders will have paid their purchase price in full and we may not require them to pay additional funds.\n\nAny preferred share terms selected by the Board could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of our Ordinary Shares or adversely affect the rights and power, including voting rights, of the holders of our Ordinary Shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of holders of our Ordinary Shares will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred shares that may be issued by us in the future. The issuance of preferred shares could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult.\n\n**Description of Debt Securities**\n\nAs used in this prospectus, the term “debt securities” means the debentures, notes, bonds and other evidences of indebtedness that we may issue from time to time. The debt securities will either be senior debt securities, senior subordinated debt or subordinated debt securities. We may also issue convertible debt securities. Debt securities issued under an indenture (which we refer to herein as an Indenture) will be entered into between us and a trustee to be named therein. It is likely that convertible debt securities will not be issued under an Indenture.\n\nThe Indenture or forms of Indentures, if any, will be filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.\n\n_As you read this section, please remember that for each series of debt securities, the specific terms of your debt security as described in the applicable prospectus supplement will supplement and, if applicable, may modify or replace the general terms described in the summary below. The statement we make in this section may not apply to your debt security._\n\nEvents of Default Under the Indenture\n\nUnless we provide otherwise in the prospectus supplement or free writing prospectus applicable to a particular series of debt securities, the following are events of default under the indentures with respect to any series of debt securities that we may issue:\n\n●| if we fail to pay the principal or premium, if any, when due and payable at maturity, upon redemption or repurchase or otherwise;  \n---|---  \n●| if we fail to pay interest when due and payable and our failure continues for certain days;  \n---|---  \n●| if we fail to observe or perform any other covenant contained in the Securities of a Series or in this Indenture, and our failure continues for certain days after we receive written notice from the trustee or holders of at least certain percentage in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the applicable series. The written notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a “Notice of Default”;  \n---|---  \n●| if specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur; and  \n---|---  \n  \n13\n\n●| if any other event of default provided with respect to securities of that series, which is specified in a Board Resolution, a supplemental indenture hereto or an Officers’ Certificate as defined in the Form of Indenture.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe covenant in the Form of Indenture to deliver a certificate to the trustee annually, within certain days after the close of the fiscal year, to show that we are in compliance with the terms of the indenture and that we have not defaulted under the indenture.\n\nNonetheless, if we issue debt securities, the terms of the debt securities and the final form of indenture will be provided in a prospectus supplement. Please refer to the prospectus supplement and the form of indenture attached thereto for the terms and conditions of the offered debt securities. The terms and conditions may or may not include whether or not we must furnish periodic evidence showing that an event of default does not exist or that we are in compliance with the terms of the indenture.\n\nThe statements and descriptions in this prospectus or in any prospectus supplement regarding provisions of the Indentures and debt securities are summaries thereof, do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the Indentures (and any amendments or supplements we may enter into from time to time which are permitted under each Indenture) and the debt securities, including the definitions therein of certain terms.\n\nGeneral\n\nUnless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement, the debt securities will be direct secured or unsecured obligations of our company. The senior debt securities will rank equally with any of our other unsecured senior and unsubordinated debt. The subordinated debt securities will be subordinate and junior in right of payment to any senior indebtedness.\n\nWe may issue debt securities from time to time in one or more series, in each case with the same or various maturities, at par or at a discount. Unless indicated in a prospectus supplement, we may issue additional debt securities of a particular series without the consent of the holders of the debt securities of such series outstanding at the time of the issuance. Any such additional debt securities, together with all other outstanding debt securities of that series, will constitute a single series of debt securities under the applicable Indenture and will be equal in ranking.\n\nShould an indenture relate to unsecured indebtedness, in the event of a bankruptcy or other liquidation event involving a distribution of assets to satisfy our outstanding indebtedness or an event of default under a loan agreement relating to secured indebtedness of our company or its subsidiaries, the holders of such secured indebtedness, if any, would be entitled to receive payment of principal and interest prior to payments on the senior indebtedness issued under an Indenture.\n\nProspectus Supplement\n\nEach prospectus supplement will describe the terms relating to the specific series of debt securities being offered. These terms will include some or all of the following:\n\n●| the title of debt securities and whether they are subordinated, senior subordinated or senior debt securities;  \n---|---  \n●| any limit on the aggregate principal amount of debt securities of such series;  \n---|---  \n●| the percentage of the principal amount at which the debt securities of any series will be issued;  \n---|---  \n●| the ability to issue additional debt securities of the same series;

 \n---|---  \n●| the terms and conditions, if any, regarding the option or mandatory conversion or exchange of debt securities;  \n---|---  \n●| the period or periods within which, the price or prices at which and the terms and conditions upon which any debt securities of the series may be redeemed, in whole or in part at our option and, if other than by a board resolution, the manner in which any election by us to redeem the debt securities shall be evidenced;  \n---|---  \n●| any restriction or condition on the transferability of the debt securities of a particular series;  \n---|---  \n●| the portion, or methods of determining the portion, of the principal amount of the debt securities which we must pay upon the acceleration of the maturity of the debt securities in connection with any event of default if other than the full principal amount;  \n---|---  \n●| the currency or currencies in which the debt securities will be denominated and in which principal, any premium and any interest will or may be payable or a description of any units based on or relating to a currency or currencies in which the debt securities will be denominated;  \n---|---  \n●| provisions, if any, granting special rights to holders of the debt securities upon the occurrence of specified events;  \n---|---  \n●| any deletions from, modifications of or additions to the events of default or our covenants with respect to the applicable series of debt securities, and whether or not such events of default or covenants are consistent with those contained in the applicable Indenture;

and  \n---|---  \n●| any other specific terms of the debt securities, including any modifications to the events of default under the debt securities and any other terms which may be required by or advisable under applicable laws or regulations.  \n---|---  \n  \nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities will not be listed on any securities exchange. Holders of the debt securities may present registered debt securities for exchange or transfer in the manner described in the applicable prospectus supplement. Except as limited by the applicable Indenture, we will provide these services without charge, other than any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection with the exchange or transfer.\n\nDebt securities may bear interest at a fixed rate or a variable rate as specified in the prospectus supplement.

We will describe in the applicable prospectus supplement any special federal income tax considerations applicable to these discounted debt securities.\n\nWe may issue debt securities with the principal amount payable on any principal payment date, or the amount of interest payable on any interest payment date, to be determined by referring to one or more currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity indices or other factors. Holders of such debt securities may receive a principal amount on any principal payment date, or interest payments on any interest payment date, that are greater or less than the amount of principal or interest otherwise payable on such dates, depending upon the value on such dates of applicable currency, commodity, equity index or other factors. The applicable prospectus supplement will contain information as to how we will determine the amount of principal or interest payable on any date, as well as the currencies, commodities, equity indices or other factors to which the amount payable on that date relates and certain additional tax considerations.\n\n**Description of Warrants**\n\nWe may issue warrants to purchase our Ordinary Shares or preferred shares. Warrants may be issued independently or together with any other securities that may be sold by us pursuant to this prospectus or any combination of the foregoing and may be attached to, or separate from, such securities. To the extent warrants that we issue are to be publicly-traded, each series of such warrants will be issued under a separate warrant agreement to be entered into between us and a warrant agent. While the terms we have summarized below will apply generally to any warrants that we may offer under this prospectus, we will describe in particular the terms of any series of warrants that we may offer in more detail in the applicable prospectus supplement and any applicable free writing prospectus. The terms of any warrants offered under a prospectus supplement may differ from the terms described below. \n\nWe will file as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, or will incorporate by reference from another report that we file with the SEC, the form of the warrant and/or warrant agreement, if any, which may include a form of warrant certificate, as applicable that describes the terms of the particular series of warrants we may offer before the issuance of the related series of warrants. We may issue the warrants under a warrant agreement that we will enter into with a warrant agent to be selected by us. The warrant agent will act solely as our agent in connection with the warrants and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency or trust for or with any registered holders of warrants or beneficial owners of warrants. The following summary of material provisions of the warrants and warrant agreements is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the form of warrant and/or warrant agreement and warrant certificate applicable to a particular series of warrants. We urge you to read the applicable prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus, as well as the complete form of warrant and/or the warrant agreement and warrant certificate, as applicable, that contain the terms of the warrants. \n\nThe particular terms of any issue of warrants will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to the issue. Those terms may include:\n\n● | the title of the warrants;  \n---|---  \n● | the price or prices at which the warrants will be issued;  \n---|---  \n● | the designation, amount and terms of the securities or other rights for which the warrants are exercisable;  \n---|---  \n  \n16\n\n● | the designation and terms of the other securities, if any, with which the warrants are to be issued and the number of warrants issued with each other security;  \n---|---  \n● | the aggregate number of warrants;  \n---|---  \n● | any provisions for adjustment of the number or amount of securities receivable upon exercise of the warrants or the exercise price of the warrants;  \n---|---  \n● | the price or prices at which the securities or other rights purchasable upon exercise of the warrants may be purchased;  \n---|---  \n● | if applicable, the date on and after which the warrants and the securities or other rights purchasable upon exercise of the warrants will be separately transferable;  \n---|---  \n● | a discussion of any material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to the exercise of the warrants;  \n---|---  \n● | the date on which the right to exercise the warrants will commence, and the date on which the right will expire;  \n---|---  \n● | the maximum or minimum number of warrants that may be exercised at any time;  \n● | information with respect to book-entry procedures, if any; and  \n---|---  \n● | any other terms of the warrants, including terms, procedures and limitations relating to the exchange and exercise of the warrants.  \n---|---  \n  \n_Exercise of Warrants_\n\nEach warrant will entitle the holder of warrants to purchase the number of Ordinary Shares or preferred shares of the relevant class or series at the exercise price stated or determinable in the prospectus supplement for the warrants. Warrants may be exercised at any time up to the close of business on the expiration date shown in the applicable prospectus supplement, unless otherwise specified in such prospectus supplement. After the close of business on the expiration date, if applicable, unexercised warrants will become void. Warrants may be exercised in the manner described in the applicable prospectus supplement. When the warrant holder makes the payment and properly completes and signs the warrant certificate at the corporate trust office of the warrant agent, if any, or any other office indicated in the prospectus supplement, we will, as soon as possible, forward the securities or other rights that the warrant holder has purchased. If the warrant holder exercises less than all of the warrants represented by the warrant certificate, we will issue a new warrant certificate for the remaining warrants. If we so indicate in the applicable prospectus supplement, holders of the warrants may surrender securities as all or part of the exercise price for warrants. \n\nPrior to the exercise of any warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares or preferred shares of the relevant class or series, holders of the warrants will not have any of the rights of holders of Ordinary Shares or preferred shares purchasable upon exercise, including the right to vote or to receive any payments of dividends or payments upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up on the Ordinary Shares or preferred shares purchasable upon exercise, if any. \n\n_Outstanding Warrants_\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, there are no outstanding warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares.\n\n**_Description of Rights_**\n\nWe may issue rights to purchase our securities. The rights may or may not be transferable by the persons purchasing or receiving the rights. In connection with any rights offering, we may enter into a standby underwriting or other arrangement with one or more underwriters or other persons pursuant to which such underwriters or other persons would purchase any offered securities remaining unsubscribed for after such rights offering. Each series of rights will be issued under a separate rights agent agreement to be entered into between us and one or more banks, trust companies or other financial institutions, as rights agent, that we will name in the applicable prospectus supplement. The rights agent will act solely as our agent in connection with the rights and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency or trust for or with any holders of rights certificates or beneficial owners of rights.\n\nThe prospectus supplement relating to any rights that we offer will include specific terms relating to the offering, including, among other matters:\n\n●| the date of determining the security holders entitled to the rights distribution;  \n---|---  \n●| the aggregate number of rights issued and the aggregate amount of securities purchasable upon exercise of the rights;  \n---|---  \n●| the exercise price;  \n---|---  \n●| the conditions to completion of the rights offering;  \n---|---  \n  \n17\n\n●| the date on which the right to exercise the rights will commence and the date on which the rights will expire; and  \n---|---  \n●| any applicable federal income tax considerations.  \n---|---  \n  \nEach right would entitle the holder of the rights to purchase for cash the principal amount of securities at the exercise price set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. Rights may be exercised at any time up to the close of business on the expiration date for the rights provided in the applicable prospectus supplement. After the close of business on the expiration date, all unexercised rights will become void.\n\nIf less than all of the rights issued in any rights offering are exercised, we may offer any unsubscribed securities directly to persons other than our security holders, to or through agents, underwriters or dealers or through a combination of such methods, including pursuant to standby arrangements, as described in the applicable prospectus supplement.\n\n**_Description of Units_**\n\nThe following description, together with the additional information we may include in any applicable prospectus supplement, summarizes the material terms and provisions of the units that we may offer under this prospectus. While the terms we have summarized below will apply generally to any units that we may offer under this prospectus, we will describe the particular terms of any series of units in more detail in the applicable prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus. The terms of any units offered under a prospectus supplement may differ from the terms described below. However, no prospectus supplement will fundamentally change the terms that are set forth in this prospectus or offer a security that is not registered and described in this prospectus at the time of its effectiveness. \n\nWe will file as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, or will incorporate by reference from another report we file with the SEC, the form of unit agreement that describes the terms of the series of units we may offer under this prospectus, and any supplemental agreements, before the issuance of the related series of units. The following summaries of material terms and provisions of the units are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the unit agreement and any supplemental agreements applicable to a particular series of units. We urge you to read the applicable prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus, as well as the complete unit agreement and any supplemental agreements that contain the terms of the units. \n\nWe may issue units consisting of any combination of the other types of securities offered under this prospectus in one or more series. We may evidence each series of units by unit certificates that we may issue under a separate agreement. We may enter into unit agreements with a unit agent. Each unit agent, if any, may be a bank or trust company that we select. We will indicate the name and address of the unit agent, if any, in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to a particular series of units. Specific unit agreements, if any, will contain additional important terms and provisions. We will file as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, or will incorporate by reference from a current report that we file with the SEC, the form of unit and the form of each unit agreement, if any, relating to units offered under this prospectus.\n\nIf we offer any units, certain terms of that series of units will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement, including, without limitation, the following, as applicable\n\n●| the title of the series of units;  \n---|---  \n●| identification and description of the separate constituent securities comprising the units;  \n---|---  \n●| the price or prices at which the units will be issued;  \n---|---  \n●| the date, if any, on and after which the constituent securities comprising the units will be separately transferable;  \n---|---  \n●| a discussion of certain United States federal income tax considerations applicable to the units; and  \n---|---  \n●| any other material terms of the units and their constituent securities.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe provisions described in this section, as well as those described under “Description of Share Capital - Ordinary Shares and Preferred Shares” and “Description of Warrants” will apply to each unit and to any Ordinary Shares, preferred shares or warrant included in each unit, respectively. \n\n_Issuance in Series_\n\nWe may issue units in such amounts and in numerous distinct series as we determine.\n\n**Transfer Agent and Registrar**\n\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our Ordinary Shares is Action Stock Transfer Corp., located in Salt Lake City, Utah. Their mailing address is 2469 E. Fort Union Blvd, Suite 214, Salt Lake City, UT, 84121. Their phone number is (801) 274-1088.\n\n18\n\n**NASDAQ Capital Market Listing**\n\nOur Ordinary Shares are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “HHT.”\n\n**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**\n\nWe may sell the securities offered through this prospectus (i) to or through underwriters or dealers, (ii) directly to purchasers, including our affiliates, (iii) through agents, or (iv) through a combination of any these methods. The securities may be distributed at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, market prices prevailing at the time of sale, prices related to the prevailing market prices, or negotiated prices. The prospectus supplement will include the following information:\n\n●| the terms of the offering;  \n---|---  \n●| the names of any underwriters or agents;  \n---|---  \n●| the name or names of any managing underwriter or underwriters;  \n---|---  \n●| the purchase price of the securities;  \n---|---  \n●| any over-allotment options under which underwriters may purchase additional securities from us;  \n---|---  \n●| the net proceeds from the sale of the securities;  \n---|---  \n●| any delayed delivery arrangements;  \n---|---  \n●| any underwriting discounts, commissions and other items constituting underwriters’ compensation;  \n---|---  \n●| any initial public offering price;  \n---|---  \n●| any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers;  \n---|---  \n●| any commissions paid to agents; and  \n---|---  \n●| any securities exchange or market on which the securities may be listed.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Sale Through Underwriters or Dealers**\n\nOnly underwriters named in the prospectus supplement are underwriters of the securities offered by the prospectus supplement. If underwriters are used in the sale, the underwriters will acquire the securities for their own account, including through underwriting, purchase, security lending or repurchase agreements with us. The underwriters may resell the securities from time to time in one or more transactions, including negotiated transactions. Underwriters may sell the securities in order to facilitate transactions in any of our other securities (described in this prospectus or otherwise), including other public or private transactions and short sales. Underwriters may offer securities to the public either through underwriting syndicates represented by one or more managing underwriters or directly by one or more firms acting as underwriters. Unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement, the obligations of the underwriters to purchase the securities will be subject to certain conditions, and the underwriters will be obligated to purchase all the offered securities if they purchase any of them. The underwriters may change from time to time any public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers.\n\nIf dealers are used in the sale of securities offered through this prospectus, we will sell the securities to them as principals. They may then resell those securities to the public at varying prices determined by the dealers at the time of resale. The prospectus supplement will include the names of the dealers and the terms of the transaction.\n\nWe will provide in the applicable prospectus supplement any compensation we will pay to underwriters, dealers or agents in connection with the offering of the securities, and any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed by underwriters to participating dealers.\n\n**Direct Sales and Sales Through Agents**\n\nWe may sell the securities offered through this prospectus directly. In this case, no underwriters or agents would be involved. Such securities may also be sold through agents designated from time to time. The prospectus supplement will name any agent involved in the offer or sale of the offered securities and will describe any commissions payable to the agent. Unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement, any agent will agree to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit purchases for the period of its appointment.\n\nWe may sell the securities directly to institutional investors or others who may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act with respect to any sale of those securities. The terms of any such sales will be described in the prospectus supplement.\n\n19\n\n**Delayed Delivery Contracts**\n\nIf the prospectus supplement indicates, we may authorize agents, underwriters or dealers to solicit offers from certain types of institutions to purchase securities at the public offering price under delayed delivery contracts. These contracts would provide for payment and delivery on a specified date in the future. The contracts would be subject only to those conditions described in the prospectus supplement. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the commission payable for solicitation of those contracts.\n\n**Market Making, Stabilization and Other Transactions**\n\nUnless the applicable prospectus supplement states otherwise, other than our Ordinary Shares, all securities we offer under this prospectus will be a new issue and will have no established trading market. We may elect to list offered securities on an exchange or in the over-the-counter market. Any underwriters that we use in the sale of offered securities may make a market in such securities, but may discontinue such market making at any time without notice. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the securities will have a liquid trading market.\n\nAny underwriter may also engage in stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Rule 104 under the Securities Exchange Act. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the underlying security in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the securities. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the securities in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions.\n\nPenalty bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the securities originally sold by the syndicate member are purchased in a syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions. Stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the securities to be higher than it would be in the absence of the transactions. The underwriters may, if they commence these transactions, discontinue them at any time.\n\n**General Information**\n\nAgents, underwriters, and dealers may be entitled, under agreements entered into with us, to indemnification by us against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Our agents, underwriters, and dealers, or their affiliates, may be customers of, engage in transactions with or perform services for us, in the ordinary course of business.\n\n**LEGAL MATTERS**\n\nExcept as otherwise set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement, certain legal matters in connection with the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus will be passed upon for us by Hunter Taubman Fischer & Li LLC to the extent governed by the laws of the State of New York, and by Conyers Dill & Pearman to the extent governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands. If legal matters in connection with offerings made pursuant to this prospectus are passed upon by counsel to underwriters, dealers or agents, such counsel will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to any such offering. \n\n**EXPERTS**\n\nThe financial statements incorporated by reference in this prospectus for the year ended June 30, 2019 have been audited by Wei, Wei & Co., LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as set forth in their report thereon appearing elsewhere herein, and are included in reliance upon such report given on the authority of such firm as experts in accounting and auditing.\n\n**FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\nThe financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 are included in our Annual Report on Form 20-F, which are incorporated by reference into this prospectus.\n\n20\n\n**INFORMATION INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE**\n\nThe SEC allows us to “incorporate by reference” into this prospectus the information we file with the SEC.

Since this prospectus may not contain all of the information that you may find important, you should review the full text of these documents. If we have filed a contract, agreement or other document as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, you should read the exhibit for a more complete understanding of the document or matter involved. Each statement in this prospectus, including statements incorporated by reference as discussed above, regarding a contract, agreement or other document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual document.\n\nWe are subject to the information reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that are applicable to foreign private issuers, and, in accordance with these requirements, we file annual and current reports and other information with the SEC. You may inspect, read (without charge) and copy the reports and other information we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an internet website at  _www.sec.gov_ that contains our filed reports and other information that we file electronically with the SEC.\n\nWe maintain a corporate website at http://www.china-acm.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute a part of this prospectus.\n\n21\n\n**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**\n\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability. We incorporated in the Cayman Islands because of certain benefits associated with being a Cayman Islands exempted company, such as political and economic stability, an effective judicial system, a favorable tax system, the absence of foreign exchange control or currency restrictions and the availability of professional and support services. However, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of securities laws that provide significantly less protection to investors as compared to the securities laws of the United States. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the United States.\n\nAll of our assets are located in China. In addition, some of our directors and officers are residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our directors and officers, or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\n\nAccording to our local Cayman Islands’ counsel, there is uncertainty with regard to Cayman Islands law relating to whether a judgment obtained from the United States or Hong Kong courts under civil liability provisions of the securities laws will be determined by the courts of the Cayman Islands as penal or punitive in nature. If such a determination is made, the courts of the Cayman Islands will not recognize or enforce the judgment against a Cayman Islands’ company. The courts of the Cayman Islands in the past determined that disgorgement proceedings brought at the instance of the Securities and Exchange Commission are penal or punitive in nature and such judgments would not be enforceable in the Cayman Islands. Other civil liability provisions of the securities laws may be characterized as remedial, and therefore enforceable but the Cayman Islands’ Courts have not yet ruled in this regard. Our Cayman Islands’ counsel has further advised us that a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of the United States under which a sum of money is payable other than a sum payable in respect of taxes, fines, penalties or similar charges, may be subject to enforcement proceedings as a debt in the courts of the Cayman Islands.\n\nAs of the date hereof, no treaty or other form of reciprocity exists between the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong governing the recognition and enforcement of judgments.\n\nCayman Islands’ counsel further advised that although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States or Hong Kong, a judgment obtained in such jurisdictions will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment (1) is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction, (2) imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given, (3) is final, (4) is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty, and (5) was not obtained in a manner and is of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands.\n\n**INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES**\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.\n\n22\n\n**13,200,000 Ordinary Shares**\n\n**COLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.**\n\n**Prospectus Supplement**\n\n**Maxim Group LLC**\n\nSeptember 15, 2020\n"

(the “Company”) and GPL Ventures LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Purchaser”) entered into that certain securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to such Purchaser an aggregate of up to 3,174,603 ordinary shares (the “Shares”), par value $0.001 per share (the “Ordinary Shares”) in a registered direct offering, for gross proceeds of up to approximately $2 million (the “Offering”).\n\nThe Shares shall be issued in four separate installments. The first installment of $500,000 worth of shares, or 793,651 shares were issued at $0.63 per share on September 9, 2020. The Company issued 31,746 Ordinary Shares (the “Additional Shares”) to the Purchaser as additional consideration for the purchase of the Shares.

This summary does not contain all of the information you should consider before investing in the securities. Before making an investment decision, you should read the entire prospectus and any supplement hereto carefully, including the risk factors section, the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements incorporated herein by reference, and the documents that we incorporate by reference herein.\n\n**Our Business**\n\n**History and Development of the Company**\n\nWe are an education provider that provides performance support and music education services via our wholly-owned subsidiary, Color China Entertainment Limited, a Hong Kong limited company (“Color China”), after-school education services via our wholly-owned subsidiary CACM Group NY, Inc. (“CACM”) and our joint venture entity, Baytao LLC.\n\nColor Star Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly known as Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.) was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C-corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, we changed our name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc.\n\nOn August 20, 2018, CACM Group NY, Inc. (“CACM”) was incorporated in the State of New York and is wholly owned by us. The establishment of CACM was to expand the Company’s business in the U.S. As of the date of this prospectus supplement, CACM has not commenced operations. \n\nOn December 31, 2018, we consummated a re-domicile merger pursuant to which we merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Cayman Islands company and the surviving entity in the merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger adopted in July 2018. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company is now governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nOn June 27, 2019, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of the Company’s memorandum and articles of association which was approved by the Company’s shareholders, the Company’s name was changed from China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. to Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“Sunway Kids”) and its shareholders. On February 14, 2020, the Company consummated the acquisition of Sunway Kids whereby we issued 1,989,262 ordinary shares and $2,000,000 of cash to be paid in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sunway Kids. The $2,000,000 cash consideration is payable in five installments over five years according to an earn-out schedule. Sunway Kids thereby became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Sunway Kids was established on February 29, 2012, under the laws of the British Virgin Islands as an offshore holding company. On August 23, 2018, Sunway Kids established its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brave Millenium Limited (“Brave Millenium”) under the laws of Hong Kong. On December 4, 2019, Brave Millenium established Chengdu Hengshanghui Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. (“Chengdu Hengshanghui”) in China as a wholly foreign owned limited liability company (the “WFOE”). On December 9, 2019, Chengdu Hengshanghui entered into a series of variable interest entity agreements with Chengdu Hengshanghui Education Consulting Co., Ltd. (“Hengshanghui Education”). Through Sunway Kids and its variable interest entity Hengshanghui Education, we are engaged in providing education and health services to day-care and preschools in China.\n\nS-1\n\nOn March 10, 2020, CACM entered into a certain joint venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Baydolphin, Inc., a company organized under the laws of New York (“Baydolphin”). Pursuant to the JV Agreement, CACM and Baydolphin have established a limited liability company under the laws of New York, Baytao LLC (“Baytao”), which will be the 100% owner of one or more operating entities in the U.S. to engage in the business of online and offline after-school education.\n\nPrior to acquisition of Sunway Kids in February 2020, our core business had been the concrete business in China. Our concrete business is highly affected by the economic cycle and government policies. The concrete industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The entire concrete industry in the Beijing area experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years as the Beijing government continues to enforce concrete production reformation and tightened environmental laws from late 2017 to date. The reformation causes great uncertainties for local enterprises in the construction market. Since 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down. Also, the Beijing government ordered the suspension of construction jobsites during winters to reduce air pollution since 2017. The operations of Beijing Xin Ao Concrete Group Co., Ltd. (“Beijing Xin Ao”), our former variable interest entity in Beijing engaging in the concrete business, were also severely affected. As a result of the Company’s deteriorating cash position, we defaulted on bank loans and experienced a substantial increase in contingent liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, there was a default on a bank loan of $24,345,129. As of December 31, 2019, Beijing Xin Ao is subject to several civil lawsuits for which the Company estimated that it is more than likely to pay judgments in the amount of approximately $6.8 million (including interest and penalties of $1.6 million). During the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were additional estimated claims of approximately $0.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The Company believes it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to turn around the concrete business. As such, the Company disposed of the concrete business after the acquisition of Sunway Kids in more detail as below.\n\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company completed the disposition (the “Disposition”) of its former subsidiary, Xin Ao Construction Materials, Inc. (“BVI-ACM”), after obtaining its shareholders’ approval on April 27, 2020 and satisfaction or waiver of all other closing conditions. Upon the closing of the Disposition, Mr. Xianfu Han and Mr. Weili He became the sole shareholders of BVI-ACM and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by BVI-ACM. The proceeds of $600,000 from the Disposition will be used for the Company’s working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nOn May 1, 2020, upon effectiveness of the Company’s amendment and restatement of its memorandum and articles of association (which was approved by the Company’s shareholders), the Company’s name was changed to Color Star Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Color China and the shareholders of Color China (the “Sellers”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company will acquire all of the outstanding issued shares and other equity interests in Color China from the Sellers (the “Acquisition”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Color China, the Company shall issue 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company and pay an aggregate of $2,000,000 to the Sellers. Headquartered in Hong Kong, China, Color China is an emerging performance equipment and music education provider with a significant collection of performance specific assets and unique experience in working with many renowned artists. Immediately after the Acquisition, Color Star will own 100% of Color China. On June 3, 2020, the transaction contemplated by the Exchange Agreement consummated when the Company issued 4,633,333 ordinary shares of the Company to the Sellers and the Sellers transferred all of Color China’s issued and outstanding shares to the Company.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the Company, Sunway Kids, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, and the former shareholders of Sunway Kids entered into Amendment No. 2 (the “Amendment”) to the Share Exchange Agreement dated December 31, 2019, as previously amended. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company shall not make any the Earn-out Payment to the former shareholders of Sunway Kids since Sunway Kids has been unable to conduct its normal operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and management of Sunway Kids believes it will be very difficult to achieve its projected financial results. On the same day, Sunway Kids and Yanliang Han (the “Purchaser”), entered into certain share purchase agreement (the “Disposition SPA”). Pursuant to the Disposition SPA, the Purchaser agreed to purchase Sunway Kids in exchange for cash consideration of $2,400,000 consisting of $400,000 which was paid within a month of closing, and $2,000,000 to be paid in monthly installments of $200,000 over 10 months. Upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Disposition SPA on June 25, 2020, the Purchaser became the sole shareholder of Sunway Kids and as a result, assumed all assets and liabilities of all the subsidiaries and variable interest entities owned or controlled by Sunway Kids and they are no longer subsidiaries and variable interest entities of the Company.\n\nS-2\n\nBelow is the Company’s corporate structure chart as of the date of this prospectus supplement.\n\n![](image_001.jpg)\n\n**Business Overview**\n\n_Performance Support and Music Education Business_\n\nColor China is in the performance support and music education business with a significant collection of music performance specific equipment. Color China’s management team has experience in large-scale entertainment performance, equipment leasing and IP licensing. Color China’s founders have experience in working with many artists in Asia and North America and have also established good relationships with many record companies and entertainment agencies in Asia and North America. Leveraging its resources, Color China is in the process of building an online entertainment and music education platform, “Color World,” featuring artists as its lead instructors.\n\nWe believe that the Color World platform being built by Color China and CACM will bring innovative changes to the current state of music education and entertainment industry. We believe that through the Internet, Color World platform can provide professional entertainment and music education globally.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and caused massive global health and economic crisis, while also causing large-scale social and behavioral changes in societies. We believe Color China’s business plan could satisfy people’s entertainment need during this special condition as most of our business is conducted on a “touch-free” online basis, and therefore expects to focus on the expansion of Color China’s business in light of its potential for revenue generation and profitability.\n\nColor China has entered into various educational licensing and performance agreements with artists and professionals (“Star Teachers”) in the entertainment industry for their services as instructors on the Color World platform and has secured the rights to the exclusive streaming of online lessons taught by the Star Teachers on the platform. Color China is also in the process of seeking out and contracting more Star Teachers in a variety of fields such as music, film, sports, animation, television, presentations, dance, and art to provide its prospective student subscribers with a large repertoire of first-hand exposure to and lessons from professionals in their desired fields.\n\nThe Color World platform will generate revenue primarily through paid membership subscriptions to our online courses. The Company also plans to generate revenue through the sales of relevant products, including but not limited to peripheral products of entertainment stars and trendy brands. Over time, we may develop more sources of revenues. Our freemium model allows us to attract users with free services and convert them into paying users. On our “Color World” platform, individual users can access a number of our courses and services for free. We convert non-paying users to paying users through a variety of means. For example, we intend to provide free trial periods to our users to allow them try premium contents that can usually be accessed exclusively by paid subscribers, free credits to users for trying premium courses, prompts with personalized suggestions on how users can improve their skills with links to our paid courses, and discounts on peripheral products for paid subscribers.\n\nS-3\n\n_Joint Venture with Baydolphin, Inc._\n\nOn March 10, 2020, CACM entered into the JV Agreement with Baydolphin. Pursuant to the JV Agreement, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, CACM and Baydolphin agreed to establish a limited company under the laws of New York, Baytao LLC (the “JV”), which will be the 100% owner of one or more operating entities in the U.S. to engage in the business of after-school education (the “Operating Entities”).\n\nPursuant to the JV Agreement, CACM shall contribute necessary capital for the Operating Entities to fund their operations and obtain the right to use of certain software platform and other technologies related to it from the Company, which will be provided to the JV and Operating Entities with no charge to facilitate the operation of the Operating Entities and provide online classes to the registered students of Operating Entities, and Baydolphin shall be responsible for managing the Operating Entities with its expertise in after-school education, including but not limited to recruiting and training personnel for the Operating Entities and implementing all promotional and marketing activities incidental to the Operating Entities. Eighty percent (80%) of the net profits or net loss of the joint venture will be distributed to or assigned to CACM and the remaining twenty percent (20%) being distributed to or assigned to Baydolphin.\n\n_U.S. After-School Education Business_\n\nPursuant to the JV Agreement, once Baytao sets up one or more Operating Entities, CACM shall contribute the necessary capital for the Operating Entities to fund their operations, and the Company will provide Baytao and Operating Entities with the use of its technologies at no extra costs to facilitate the operations of the Operating Entities and provide online classes to the registered students of the Operating Entities. Furthermore, Baydolphin is responsible for managing the Operating Entities with its expertise in after-school education, including but not limited to recruiting and training personnel for the Operating Entities and implementing all promotional and marketing activities incidental to the Operating Entities.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nOn August 21, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with a non-affiliated third party pursuant to which the Company purchased certain machinery and equipment for stage performance (the “Purchased Assets”) for a total purchase price of $6,818,000, of which $3,000,000 shall be paid in cash and the remaining $3,818,000 shall be paid in the form of 6,060,318 ordinary shares of the Company, valued at $0.63 per share, the closing price of these shares on August 20, 2020. $2,000,000 of the cash consideration was paid and the remaining $1,000,000 shall be paid within sixty days of the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Purchased Assets will be in furtherance of the Company’s performance support and music education business.\n\nOn August 12, 2020, Wei Pei tendered his notice of resignation to the Company due to personal reason, effective on the date thereof. Mr. Pei had served as Company’s independent director, Chairperson of the Nominating and Governance Committee and member of the Audit and Compensation Committee. On the same date, the Board of Directors (“the Board”) of the Company appointed Mr. Hung-Jen Kuo to fill in the vacancies left by Mr. Pei in the all of his positions with the Company.\n\nOn July 20, 2020, the Company and certain institutional investors entered into certain securities purchase agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to such these investors an aggregate of 3,225,000 ordinary shares in a registered direct offering and warrants to purchase up to 2,096,252 ordinary shares in a concurrent private placement, for gross proceeds of approximately $4.19 million.

If any of the following events actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations and could result in a complete loss of your investment._\n\n_You should also carefully consider the risk factors set forth under “Risk Factors” described in our most recent annual report on Form 20-F, filed on November 15, 2019, together with all other information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and in any related free writing prospectus in connection with a specific offering, before making an investment decision._\n\n**Risks Related to the Current Pandemic**\n\n**_Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19._**\n\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus causing respiratory illness, or COVID-19, has surfaced in Wuhan, China, spreading at a fast rate in January and February of 2020, and confirmed cases were also reported in other parts of the world. In reaction to this outbreak, an increasing number of countries imposed travel suspensions to and from China following the World Health Organization’s “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) announcement on January 30, 2020. Since this outbreak, business activities in China and many other countries including U.S. have been disrupted by a series of emergency quarantine measures taken by the government.\n\nAs a result, our operations in China and U.S. have been materially affected. Our offices in Chengdu were temporarily closed until early March. Although our offices re-opened in early March, since no children have been allowed to attend daycare centers or preschools as of the date of this Prospectus, Sunway Kids has not been able to generate any meaningful revenue since the start of the pandemic. Additionally, New York, where our U.S. operations are based, is currently significantly affected by COVID-19, which led to measures taken by the New York government trying to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as closure of schools and travel restrictions. Additional travel and other restrictions may be put in place to further control the outbreak in U.S. As a result of these, management has to temporarily postpone the rolling out of our afterschool centers in New York. The launching of the online education platform we are jointly developing with Color China has also been delayed. Accordingly, our operation and business have been and will continue to be adversely affected as the results of the wide-spread pandemic. Management may have to adjust or change our business plan in response to the prolonged pandemic and change of social behavior.\n\nThe extent to which COVID-19 negatively impacts our business is highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We believe that the coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to control it may have a significant negative impact on not only our business, but economic activities globally. The magnitude of this negative effect on the continuity of our business operation in China and U.S. remains uncertain. These uncertainties impede our ability to conduct our daily operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result affect our stock price and create more volatility.\n\nS-6\n\n**Risks Related to our Joint Venture with Baydolphin, Inc.**\n\n**_We may not be able to oversee the new joint venture efficiently._**\n\nWe may not be able to oversee Baytao, our new joint venture, efficiently, realize anticipated profits or effectively implement our growth and operating strategies. As we begin our operations in the United States through our joint venture, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. We will need to transition from a company with our primary operations in China to a company capable of supporting operations in both China and the United States. We might not be successful in such a transition. There can be no guarantee that the addition of the new joint venture will not cause us to incur additional debt and increase our exposure to market and other risks. Our failure to successfully pursue our strategies or effectively operate the joint venture entity could also have a material adverse effect on our rate of growth and operating performance.\n\n**_There may be integration issues between Baytao and Color China’s technologies._**\n\nThe services provided by Baytao will need to be integrated with Color China’s existing software and technologies so as to achieve our operating strategies. If we are unable to achieve a successful integration with Color China’s software and technologies, we may not be successful in developing and marketing our new services and courses and our operating results will materially suffer. In addition, if the integrated services and courses we offer do not achieve acceptance by the marketplace, our operating results will materially suffer. Also, if new industry standards emerge that we do not anticipate or adapt to, our software products could be rendered obsolete and, as a result, our business and operating results, as well as our ability to compete in the marketplace, would be materially harmed.\n\n**Risks Related to our Acquisition of Color China Entertainment Limited**\n\n**_We may not be able to oversee the combined entity efficiently._**\n\nWe may not be able to oversee the combined entity efficiently, realize anticipated profits or effectively implement our growth and operating strategies. We are now managing two related businesses in the education industry, the music education business conducted through Color China and the online learning platform conducted via Baytao, which have different customers, suppliers, and competition landscapes. This involves risks that could adversely affect our operating results due to uncertainties involved with the new business, diversion of management’s attention in operating and managing the new business. There can be no guarantee that the addition of the new business will not cause us to incur additional debt and increase our exposure to market and other risks. In addition, Color China’s management team has very little experience with the necessary disclosure practices of a public company and may not be able to timely provide sufficient information to our accounting staff. Our failure to successfully pursue our strategies or effectively operate and manage the combined entity could also have a material adverse effect on our rate of growth and operating performance.\n\n**Risks Related to our Education Service Business**\n\n**_If we are unable to launch and operate the “Color World” platform as planned, our results of operation will be significantly impacted._**\n\nThe launch of the “Color World” platform will depend on many factors, including realistic scheduling of the development time, the effectiveness of quality control, maintaining high productivity when facing unexpected technical difficulties, the time to obtain and integrate third-party services, the changes in availabilities of software and hardware infrastructures provided by third parties, and sudden changes in government policies. Once Color World has launched, the attractiveness of our platform to our prospective “Star Teachers” and student subscribers also depends on our ability to innovate. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and expand our platform and education services. We must also continue to enhance and improve our technology infrastructure. These efforts may require us to develop or license increasingly complex technologies. In addition, new education services and technologies developed and introduced by competitors could render our education services and technologies obsolete if we are unable to update or modify our own technology. Developing and integrating new education services and technologies into our existing platform and infrastructure could be expensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, any new features and functions may not achieve market acceptance. We may not succeed in implementing new technologies, or may incur substantial costs in doing so. Our platform and education services must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order for us to recoup our investments. Our platform and education services could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:\n\n● | we may fail to predict market demand accurately and to provide education services that meet this demand in a timely fashion;  \n---|---  \n  \nS-7\n\n● | our marketing efforts may be inefficient and fail to attract the potential users;  \n---|---  \n● | Star Teachers that we recruit on our platforms may not like, find useful or agree with any changes;  \n---|---  \n● | there may be defects, errors or failures on our platform;  \n---|---  \n● | there may be negative publicity about our platforms’ performance or effectiveness; and  \n---|---  \n● | there may be competing services or technologies introduced or anticipated to be introduced by our competitors.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf our platform and education services or technologies do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n**_Our success relies on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and qualified key personnel, and our business may be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate them._**\n\nOur business operations depend on the continued services of our senior management team and qualified key personnel, particularly our executive officers and the senior management of Color China, our wholly owned subsidiary.\n\nAlthough we have provided different incentives to our senior management team, we cannot assure you that we can continue to retain their services. One or more of our key executives may be unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions. Meanwhile, we have also provided attractive compensation packages to our qualified key personnel. However, we may not be able to hire and retain these personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Some of the companies with which we compete for qualified and skilled personnel have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment. In addition, we invest significant time and resources in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them.\n\nIf we are unable to retain the services of our senior management team or qualified key personnel, we may not be able to find suitable replacements or may incur significant expenses in finding such replacements, thus our future growth may be constrained, our business may be severely disrupted and our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, although we have entered into confidentiality and non-competition agreements with our senior management team and qualified key personnel, there is no assurance that any member of our senior management team or any of our qualified key personnel will not join a competitor. In the event that any dispute arises between us, on one hand, and any of our senior management and qualified key personnel, on the other hand, we may have to incur substantial costs and expenses in order to enforce such agreements, or we may be unable to enforce them at all.\n\n**_If we are unable to recruit “Star Teachers” as planned or if these instructors do not perform according to the agreements we have with them, the operation of our performance support and music education business will be negatively impacted._**\n\nProfessional artists and producers that we have begun recruiting as our Star Teachers help us build and maintain the quality of our education and services, as well as our brand and reputation. Our ability to continue to attract recruit the instructors with the necessary experience and qualifications is a key factor in the success of our operations. We seek to continue hiring experienced and successful professionals in music, film, sports, animation, television, presentations, dance, art and other entertainment industries whom are able to follow our education service protocols and deliver effective instructions based on the agreements we have with them. The market for the recruitment of these professionals is competitive, and we must also provide continued training to ensure that our instructors stay abreast of changes in student demands, teaching methodologies and other necessary changes.\n\nIn order to recruit these industry professionals as instructors on our platform, we must provide candidates with competitive compensation packages. Although we have not experienced major difficulties in recruiting or training qualified instructors thus far, we cannot guarantee we will be able to continue to recruit, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified instructors in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nS-8\n\n**_If we are unable to reach a critical mass of subscribers, our revenues may not be sufficient to cover the costs of our recruitment of Star Teachers._**\n\nWe are obligated to pay each of our Star Teachers on a case-by-case basis depending on the results of our negotiations. Some Star Teachers will accept fixed payments following a predefined schedule, whereas others may instead request a revenue sharing payment model whereby we will need to distribute to the Star Teachers a percentage of the net income earned from generated sales, licensing or other revenue from their courses on our platform, including a pro rata share of our subscription fees, or a hybrid of the two. If we are unable to generate enough revenue from our subscription fees from our users to cover our Star Teachers’ recruitment costs, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n**_Our education service revenue model depends on developing a subscriber base of users. If we fail to reach a critical mass of subscribers, our net revenues may decline, and we may not be able to implement our business plan._**\n\nWe expect to generate revenue primarily from the fees we collect from our users. It is critical for us to enroll subscribers in a cost-effective manner. Some of the factors, many of which are largely beyond our control, could prevent us from successfully increasing subscriptions in a cost-effective manner, or at all. These factors include, among other things, (i) reduced interest in the products and services we offer; (ii) negative publicity or perceptions regarding us, or electronic education services in general; (iii) the emergence of alternative technologies not offered by us; (iv) the inability of subscribers to pay the fees; (v) increasing market competition, particularly price reductions by competitors that we are unable or unwilling to match; and (vi) adverse changes in relevant government policies or general economic conditions. If one or more of these factors reduce market demand for our services, our subscriber base may not materialize as anticipated or our costs associated with subscriber acquisition and retention could increase, or both, any of which could materially affect our ability to grow our gross billings and net revenues. These developments could also harm our brand and reputation, which would negatively impact our ability to establish or expand our business.\n\n**_We expect to invest in our growth for the foreseeable future. If we fail to manage this growth effectively, the success of our business model will be compromised._**\n\nWe anticipate rapid growth in gross billings and net revenues upon the acquisition of our childhood education business segment, which growth is expected to be driven primarily by the growth of our subscriber base. Rapid growth may place a significant strain on our sales and marketing capacities, administrative and operating infrastructure, facilities and other resources. To manage our anticipated our growth, we may need to continue to acquire more subscribers, scale up our product and service offerings, as well as strengthen our platforms and systems. We will also be required to refine our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to efficiently manage the establishment and future expansion of our business, our costs and expenses may increase more than we plan and we may not successfully attract a sufficient number of subscribers and strategic partners in a cost-effective manner, respond to competitive challenges, or otherwise execute our business plans. In addition, we may, as part of carrying out our growth strategies, adopt new initiatives to offer additional educational content and to implement new pricing models and strategies. We cannot assure you that these initiatives may achieve the anticipated results. These proposed changes may not be well received by our existing and prospective users, in which case their experience with our education services may suffer, which could damage our reputation and business prospects.\n\nOur ability to effectively implement our strategies and manage any significant growth of our business will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to: (i) identify and effectively market our products and services in new markets with sufficient growth potential; (ii) develop and improve service and product offerings to make them appealing to our users; (iii) maintain and increase our subscriber base; (iv) effectively recruit, train and motivate a large number of new employees, including sales and marketing personnel; (v) successfully implement enhancements and improvements to the systems and platforms; (vi) continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and efficiencies; (vii) protect and further develop our intellectual property rights; and (viii) make sound business decisions in light of the scrutiny associated with operating as a public company. These activities require significant capital expenditures and investment of valuable management and financial resources, and our growth will continue to place significant demands on our management. There are no guarantees that we will be able to effectively manage any future growth in an efficient, cost-effective and timely manner, or at all. If we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, our reputation, results of operations and overall business and prospects could be negatively impacted.\n\nS-9\n\n**_We expect to rely heavily on information and technology to operate our existing and future education products and services, and any cybersecurity incident or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could result in the loss of critical confidential information or adversely impact our reputation, business or results of operations._**\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and to compete effectively depends in part upon the satisfactory performance and reliability of our technology network, including the ability to provide features of services that are important to our customers and to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers. We also rely on our technology to maintain and process various operating and financial data that are essential to the day-to-day operation of our business and formulation of our development strategies. Our business operations and growth prospects depend on our ability to maintain and make timely and cost-effective enhancements and upgrades to our technology system and to introduce innovative additions that can meet changing operational needs in future. Therefore, we expect to continue to invest in advanced information technology and any equipment to enhance operational efficiency and reliability as we grow. Accordingly, any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our IT infrastructure could damage our reputation, decrease user satisfaction and retention, adversely impact our ability to attract new users and expand our service and product offerings, and materially disrupt our operations. If any of these occur, our business operations, reputation and prospects could be harmed.\n\n**_If our security measures are breached or fail and result in unauthorized disclosure of data by our employees or our third-party agents, we could lose existing subscribers, fail to attract new subscribers and be exposed to protracted and costly litigation._**\n\nMaintaining platform security is of critical importance to our subscribers because the platform stores and transmits proprietary and confidential information, which may include sensitive personally identifiable information that may be subject to stringent legal and regulatory obligations. As an electronic education service provider, we face an increasing number of threats to our IT infrastructure, including unauthorized activity and access by our employees or third-party agents, system viruses, worms, malicious code and organized cyber-attacks, which could breach our security and disrupt our business. We hope to introduce data security and confidentiality protocols into the cooperation agreements we enter into with third-party sales agents with whom we share prospective subscribers’ contact information. As we expand, we hope to invest in improving our technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans to prevent unauthorized access of confidential or sensitive personal information by our employees and third-party sales agents in the process of engaging prospective subscribers.\n\nThese measures, however, may not be as effective as we anticipate. In addition, there is no assurance that our third-party sales agents will comply with contractual and legal requirements with respect to data privacy when they collect data from our prospective customers. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, we could be subject to liability or our business could be interrupted, potentially over an extended period of time. Any or all of these issues could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to attract and enroll prospective subscribers, cause prospective subscribers not to enroll or stay enrolled, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability. Further, any reputational damage resulting from breach of our security measures could create distrust of our company by prospective subscribers or investors. We may be required to expend significant management time and additional resources to protect against the threat of these disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such disruptions or breaches.\n\n**_Privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our user data and disclosure of user data could adversely impact our business and reputation._**\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business and in particular in connection with conducting sales and marketing activities with our existing and prospective subscribers as well as the utilization of our AI-powered platform programs, we collect and utilize data supplied by our users. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our users in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results.\n\nS-10\n\nInternationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\n**_We face regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to the licensing requirement for the online transmission of internet audio-visual programs in China._**\n\nOn December 20, 2007, the National Radio and Television Administration f/k/a known as the State Administration of Press Publication Radio Film and Television, or SAPPRFT, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, jointly promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Internet Audio Visual Program Services, or the Audio Visual Program Provisions, which became effective on January 31, 2008 and were amended on August 28, 2015. Among other things, the Audio Visual Program Provisions stipulate that no entities or individuals may provide Internet audio-visual program services without a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs issued by SAPPRFT or completing the relevant filing with SAPPRFT or its local bureaus, and only state-owned or state-controlled entities are eligible to apply for a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs. On April 1, 2010, SAPPRFT promulgated the Provisional Implementations of Tentative Categories of Internet Audio Visual Program Services, or the Categories, which clarified the scope of Internet audio-visual programs services, which was amended on March 10, 2017. According to the Categories, there are four categories of Internet audio-visual program services which are further divided into seventeen sub-categories. Sub-category No. 3 to the second category covers the making and editing of certain specialized audio-visual programs concerning, among other things, educational content, and broadcasting such content to the general public online. Sub-category No. 5 of the first category and sub-category No. 7 of the second category cover the live broadcasting of important political, martial, economic, social, cultural, sports activities or events or general social or community cultural activities, sports games and other organized activities. However, there are still significant uncertainties relating to the interpretation and implementation of the Audio Visual Program Provisions, in particular, the scope of “internet audio-visual programs.” See “Regulations Relating to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs.”\n\nWe plan to deliver our courses in live streaming format worldwide. Our teachers and students communicate and interact live with each other via our virtual learning community. The audio and video data will likely be transmitted through the platforms between specific recipients instantly without any further redaction. We believe the nature of the raw data we transmit will distinguish us from general providers of internet audio-visual program services, such as the operator of online video websites, and the provision of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions are not applicable with regard to our offering of the courses. However, we cannot assure you that the competent PRC government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to our opinion. In addition, we also plan to offer video recordings of live streaming courses and certain other audio-video contents on our electronic platforms to our students as supplementary course materials on our platforms. If the government authorities determine that our offering of the courses fall within the relevant category of Internet audio-visual program services under the Categories, we may be required to obtain the License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs.\n\nThe Categories describe “Internet audio-visual program services” in a very broad, vague manner and are unclear as to whether electronic courses, whether delivered in a live streaming format or through video recordings, fall into the definition of audio-visual programs. We have made inquiries to the relevant bureaus of SAPPRFT and were informed that online educational content provided through live streaming or recorded courses does not fall within the scope of internet audio-visual programs, the transmission of which does not require a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs. We cannot assure you that the PRC government will not ultimately take a view that live streaming or recorded courses or any other content offered on our platforms are subject to the Audio Visual Program Provisions. We currently do not hold a license for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs, and since we are not a state-owned or state-controlled entity, we are not eligible to apply for such license. If the PRC government determines that our content should be considered as “internet audio- visual programs” for the purpose of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, we may be required to obtain a license for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs. We are, however, not eligible apply for such license since we are not a state-owned or state-controlled entity. If this were to occur, we may be subject to penalties, fines, legal sanctions or an order to suspend the provision of our live streaming courses. As of the date of this annual report, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities regarding the lack of a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs in conducting of our business.\n\nS-11\n\n**_Our failure to obtain and maintain approvals, licenses or permits in China applicable to our business could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations in the future._**\n\nAs we plan to deliver our courses in live streaming format worldwide, including in China, we may be subject to various regulations by a number of PRC regulatory authorities, such as the SAIC, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the MITT, the National Radio and Television Administration, and the State Council Information Office, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Welfare. We may be required in the future to obtain additional government approvals, licenses and permits in connection with our operations.\n\nBy way of example, depending upon regulatory interpretation, under the current PRC laws and regulations, the provision of our educational content through our electronic platform may be considered “online publishing” and may require us to obtain an Internet Publishing License, which we currently do not have.\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities regarding the lack of any the above-mentioned approvals, licenses or permits. However, we cannot guarantee that the government authorities will not impose any penalties or sanctions on us in the future, which may include warnings, fines, mandates to remedy any violations, confiscation of the gains derived from the services for which approvals, licenses or permits are required, and/or an order to cease to provide such services. In addition, we cannot guarantee that the government will not promulgate new laws and regulations that require additional licenses, permits and/or approvals for the operation of any of our existing or future business. If we are unable to obtain such licenses, permits, or approvals in a timely fashion, we could be subject to penalties and operational disruption and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n**_We face intense competition which could adversely affect our results of operations and market share._**\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is sensitive to price, content (_i.e._ , curriculum) and quality of service. Some of our competitors may have more financial resources, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do, or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to obtain or raise capital and enter into strategic relationships more easily. We also compete with leading domestic supplier companies based on a number of factors including business model, operational capabilities, cost control and service quality, as well as in-house delivery capabilities to serve their logistics needs and compete with us.\n\nWe are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that affect many other businesses, including but not limited to:\n\n(1) | Increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare benefits;  \n---|---  \n(2) | The increasing costs of compliance with federal, state and foreign governmental agency mandates;  \n---|---  \n(3) | Any impacts on our business resulting from new domestic and international government laws and regulation;  \n---|---  \n(4) | Market conditions in the childhood education industry or the economy as a whole;  \n---|---  \n(5) | Market acceptance of our new service and growth initiatives;  \n---|---  \n(6) | Announcements of the introduction of new products and services by our competitors;  \n---|---  \n(7) | The impact of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our products and services;  \n---|---  \n(8) | Developments concerning current or future strategic collaborations; and  \n---|---  \n(9) | Widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis such as we are currently experiencing with the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf we are unable to respond to these changing market conditions, our business and financial results may be materially affected.\n\nS-12\n\n**Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares**\n\n**_If we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of NASDAQ, we would face possible delisting, which would result in a limited public market for our shares and make obtaining future debt or equity financing more difficult for us._**\n\nOn November 18, 2019, we received a notification letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Stockholder Equity Requirement”). The notification received had no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Nasdaq has provided us with 45 calendar days, or until January 2, 2020, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity standard. If our plan to regain compliance is accepted, Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the notification letter, or until May 16, 2019, to evidence compliance. On January 2, 2020, we submitted our plan of compliance to Nasdaq.\n\nOn January 24, 2020, we received a notice (the “Notice”) from Nasdaq stating that we were not able to regain compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement or the alternative criteria set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b) and that the Staff had determined to seek to delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq unless the Company requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). On January 28, 2020 we requested a hearing before the Panel. Such request will stay any suspension or delisting action by Nasdaq pending the completion of the hearing process. On January 30, 2020, we received a hearing instruction letter from Nasdaq stating that the delisting action referenced in the Notice has been stayed, pending a final written decision by the Panel.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, the Company appeared before the Panel to demonstrate its ability to regain compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement and subsequently submitted supplemental information to the Panel on March 23, 2020 pursuant to the Panel’s request. By a letter dated April 16, 2020, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that the Panel had determined to continue the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares based upon the Company’s compliance with the Stockholder Equity Requirement. Additionally, the Panel advised in such letter that is has placed the Company under a Panel Monitor (the “Monitor”) that shall last through April 15, 2021. Pursuant to that Monitor and as provided in the Nasdaq Rules, if at any time during the monitor period the Company fails to maintain compliance with any listing standard, Nasdaq will issue a Staff Delisting Determination and the Hearings Department will promptly schedule a new hearing.\n\nSeparately, on March 5, 2020, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we are no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Requirement”). The notification received has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company has until September 1, 2020 to regain compliance. If at any time during such 180-day period the closing bid price of the Company’s ordinary shares is at least $1 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company written confirmation of compliance.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5550(a)(2), as the Company maintained a closing bid price of $1.00 per share or greater for twenty (20) consecutive days from July 13 through August 7, 2020.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain the compliance with the Nasdaq rules. If we fail to comply with the Bid Price Requirement or any other listing rules when required in the future, we could be subject to suspension and delisting proceedings. If our securities lose their status on The NASDAQ Capital Market, our securities would likely trade in the over-the-counter market. If our securities were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our securities could be more difficult because smaller quantities of securities would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and security analysts’ coverage of us may be reduced. In addition, in the event our securities are delisted, broker-dealers have certain regulatory burdens imposed upon them, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, further limiting the liquidity of our securities. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities. Such delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market and continued or further declines in our share price could also greatly impair our ability to raise additional necessary capital through equity or debt financing, and could significantly increase the ownership dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity in financing or other transactions.\n\nS-13\n\n**USE OF PROCEEDS**\n\nAssuming 3,174,603 shares are sold by us, we estimate the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately $1,890,000 after deducting the estimated offering expenses payable by us; among which, for the sale of the first of the four installments of the total 3,174,603 shares, or 793,651 shares, we estimate the net proceeds to us will be approximately $450,000 after deducting the estimated offering expenses payable by us.\n\nWe intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for improving and expanding our existing business, working capital and other general corporate purposes.\n\nThe amounts and timing of our use of proceeds will vary depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash generated or used by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic transactions.\n\nS-14\n\n**DIVIDEND POLICY**\n\nWhile we have no current intention of paying dividends, should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments.\n\nS-15\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF OUR SECURITIES WE ARE OFFERING**\n\nWe are offering 3,206,349 of our ordinary shares pursuant to this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. The material terms and provisions of our ordinary shares are described under the caption “Descriptions of Share Capital” beginning on page 10 of the accompanying prospectus.\n\nS-16\n\n**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**\n\nWe are offering the shares of ordinary shares directly to the Investor hereunder. We currently anticipate that the closing of the sale of the first installment of $500,000 worth of shares, or 793,651 shares under this prospectus supplement will take place on or about September 8, 2020. On the closing date of the first installment, we will issue the shares of ordinary shares to the Investor and we will receive funds in the amount of the aggregate purchase price of $500,000.\n\nWe have entered into a securities purchase agreement, dated as of September 4, 2020, with the Investor relating to the sale of our ordinary shares under this prospectus supplement. Our obligation to issue and sell ordinary shares to the Investor is subject to the customary conditions set forth in the securities purchase agreement, which may be waived by us in our discretion. The Investor’s obligation to purchase securities is subject to customary conditions set forth in the securities purchase agreement as well, which also may be waived.\n\nThe ordinary shares were offered directly to the Investor without a placement agent, underwriter, broker or dealer. The expenses of this offering payable by us are estimated to be approximately $110,000 for the entire $2 million offering, if the four installments are performed, including $50,000 for the first installment of $500,000.\n\nS-17\n\n**Transfer Agent and Registrar**\n\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our ordinary shares is Action Stock Transfer Corp., located at 2469 E. Fort Union Blvd, Suite 214, Salt Lake City, UT, 84121. Our transfer agent’s phone number is (801) 274-1088.\n\n**Listing**\n\nOur ordinary shares are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol “HHT.”\n\n**LEGAL MATTERS**\n\nCertain legal matters governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands with respect to the validity of the offered securities will be passed upon for us by Conyers Dill & Pearman, Cayman Islands. Certain legal matters governed by the laws of New York will be passed upon for us by Pryor Cashman LLP, New York, New York.\n\n**EXPERTS**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of our Company appearing in our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 have been audited by Wei, Wei & Co., LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as set forth in the reports thereon included therein and incorporated herein by reference.

Since this prospectus may not contain all of the information that you may find important, you should review the full text of these documents. If we have filed a contract, agreement or other document as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, you should read the exhibit for a more complete understanding of the document or matter involved. Each statement in this prospectus, including statements incorporated by reference as discussed above, regarding a contract, agreement or other document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual document.\n\nWe are subject to the information reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that are applicable to foreign private issuers, and, in accordance with these requirements, we file annual and current reports and other information with the SEC. You may inspect, read (without charge) and copy the reports and other information we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an internet website at  _www.sec.gov_ that contains our filed reports and other information that we file electronically with the SEC.\n\nWe maintain a corporate website at http://www.colorstarinternational.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute a part of this prospectus.\n\n**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**\n\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability. We were incorporated in the Cayman Islands because of certain benefits associated with being a Cayman Islands corporation, such as political and economic stability, an effective judicial system, a favorable tax system, the absence of foreign exchange control or currency restrictions and the availability of professional and support services. However, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of securities laws that provide significantly less protection to investors as compared to the securities laws of the United States. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the United States.\n\nSubstantially all of our assets are located in Hong Kong. In addition, some of our directors and officers are residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our directors and officers, or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\n\nS-19\n\nAccording to our local Cayman Islands’ counsel, there is uncertainty with regard to Cayman Islands law relating to whether a judgment obtained from the United States or Hong Kong courts under civil liability provisions of the securities laws will be determined by the courts of the Cayman Islands as penal or punitive in nature. If such a determination is made, the courts of the Cayman Islands will not recognize or enforce the judgment against a Cayman Islands’ company. The courts of the Cayman Islands in the past determined that disgorgement proceedings brought at the instance of the Securities and Exchange Commission are penal or punitive in nature and such judgments would not be enforceable in the Cayman Islands. Other civil liability provisions of the securities laws may be characterized as remedial, and therefore enforceable but the Cayman Islands’ Courts have not yet ruled in this regard. Our Cayman Islands’ counsel has further advised us that a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of the United States under which a sum of money is payable other than a sum payable in respect of taxes, fines, penalties or similar charges, may be subject to enforcement proceedings as a debt in the courts of the Cayman Islands.\n\nAs of the date hereof, no treaty or other form of reciprocity exists between the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong governing the recognition and enforcement of judgments.\n\nCayman Islands’ counsel further advised that although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States or Hong Kong, a judgment obtained in such jurisdictions will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment (1) is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction, (2) imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given, (3) is final, (4) is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty, and (5) was not obtained in a manner and is of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands.\n\n**INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES**\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.\n\nS-20\n\n**PROSPECTUS**\n\n**Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.**\n\n**$50,000,000**\n\n**Ordinary Shares, Preferred Shares, Debt Securities**\n\n**Warrants, Units and Rights**\n\nWe may, from time to time in one or more offerings, offer and sell up to $50,000,000 in the aggregate of Ordinary Shares, preferred shares, warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares or preferred shares, debt securities, rights or any combination of the foregoing, either individually or as units comprised of one or more of the other securities. The prospectus supplement for each offering of securities will describe in detail the plan of distribution for that offering.

We may also authorize one or more free writing prospectuses to be provided to you in connection with these offerings. The prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus may add, update or change information contained in this prospectus. You should read carefully this prospectus, the applicable prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus, as well as the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference, before you invest in any of our securities. **This prospectus may not be used to offer or sell any securities unless accompanied by the applicable prospectus supplement.**\n\nPursuant to General Instruction I.B.5. of Form F-3, in no event will we sell the securities covered hereby in a public primary offering with a value exceeding more than one-third of the aggregate market value of our Ordinary Shares in any 12-month period so long as the aggregate market value of our outstanding Ordinary Shares held by non-affiliates remains below $75,000,000. During the 12 calendar months prior to and including the date of this prospectus, we have not offered or sold any securities pursuant to General Instruction I.B.5 of Form F-3.\n\nOur Ordinary Shares are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “HHT.” On February 14, 2020, the last reported sale price of our Ordinary Shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market was $0.95 per share.

See “Risk Factors” on page 5 of** **this prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus, as updated in the applicable prospectus supplement, any related free writing prospectus and other future filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission that are incorporated by reference into this prospectus, for a discussion of the factors you should consider carefully before deciding to purchase our securities.**\n\nWe may sell these securities directly to investors, through agents designated from time to time or to or through underwriters or dealers. For additional information on the methods of sale, you should refer to the section entitled “Plan of Distribution” in this prospectus. If any underwriters are involved in the sale of any securities with respect to which this prospectus is being delivered, the names of such underwriters and any applicable commissions or discounts will be set forth in a prospectus supplement.

Under this shelf registration process, we may from time to time sell Ordinary Shares, preferred shares, warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares or preferred shares, debt securities or any combination of the foregoing, either individually or as units comprised of one or more of the other securities, in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of $50,000,000. We have provided to you in this prospectus a general description of the securities we may offer. Each time we sell securities under this shelf registration, we will, to the extent required by law, provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of that offering. We may also authorize one or more free writing prospectuses to be provided to you that may contain material information relating to these offerings. The prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus that we may authorize to be provided to you may also add, update or change information contained in this prospectus or in any documents that we have incorporated by reference into this prospectus. To the extent there is a conflict between the information contained in this prospectus and the prospectus supplement or any related free writing prospectus, you should rely on the information in the prospectus supplement or the related free writing prospectus; provided that if any statement in one of these documents is inconsistent with a statement in another document having a later date – for example, a document filed after the date of this prospectus and incorporated by reference into this prospectus or any prospectus supplement or any related free writing prospectus – the statement in the document having the later date modifies or supersedes the earlier statement.\n\nWe have not authorized any dealer, agent or other person to give any information or to make any representation other than those contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement, or any related free writing prospectus that we may authorize to be provided to you.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements,” including any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items, any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations, any statements concerning proposed new projects or other developments, any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance, any statements of management’s beliefs, goals, strategies, intentions and objectives, and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. The words “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “potential,” “likely,” “projects,” “continue,” “will,” and “would” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.

Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n**OUR BUSINESS**\n\n**History and Development of the Company**\n\nHuitao Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly known as China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc.) was founded as an unincorporated business on September 1, 2005, under the name TJS Wood Flooring, Inc., and became a C corporation in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. On April 29, 2008, we changed our name to China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. in response to a reverse acquisition transaction with BVI-ACM described below.\n\nBVI-ACM was established on October 9, 2007, under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. The majority shareholders of BVI-ACM also control Xin Ao, a limited liability company formed under laws of China through a series of agreements. BVI-ACM was established as a “special purpose vehicle” for foreign fund raising for Xin Ao. China State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, requires the owners of any Chinese companies to obtain SAFE’s approval before establishing any offshore holding company structure for foreign financing as well as subsequent acquisition matters. On September 29, 2007, BVI-ACM was approved by local Chinese SAFE as a “special purpose vehicle” offshore company.\n\nOn November 23, 2007, BVI-ACM established a subsidiary, China-ACMH, in China as a wholly owned foreign limited liability company with registered capital of $5 million. Through China-ACMH and its variable interest entity Xin Ao, we were solely engaged in producing general ready-mixed concrete, customized mechanical refining concrete, and some other concrete-related products which are mainly sold in China.\n\nOn April 29, 2008, we completed a reverse acquisition transaction with BVI-ACM to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of BVI-ACM. BVI-ACM thereby became our wholly owned subsidiary and the former stockholders of BVI-ACM became our controlling stockholders.\n\nOn September 20, 2010, China ACMH established a 100% owned subsidiary, Advanced Investment Holdings Co., Inc., or AIH, in the State of Nevada. AIH never engaged in operations and the Company subsequently dissolved AIH on August 30, 2011.\n\nOn August 1, 2013, we consummated a reincorporation merger pursuant to which we merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Nevada corporation and the surviving entity in the merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into as of August 1, 2013. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company became governed by the laws of the state of Nevada.\n\nOn August 20, 2018, CACM Group NY, Inc. (“CACM”) was incorporated in the State of New York and is wholly owned by us. The establishment of CACM was to expand the Company’s business in the U.S. As of the date of the report, CACM has not commenced any operations.\n\nOn December 31, 2018, we consummated a re-domicile merger pursuant to which we merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc., a newly formed Cayman Islands company and the surviving entity in the merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger adopted in July 2018. As a result of the reincorporation, the Company is now governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\nOn June 27, 2019, upon effectiveness of the Company amendment and restatement of the Company’s memorandum and articles of association which was approved by the Company’s shareholders, the Company’s name was changed from China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. to Huitao Technology Co., Ltd.\n\n2\n\nOn February 14, 2020, the Company consummated the acquisition of Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd. (“**Sunway Kids** ”) whereby we issued 1,989,262 Ordinary Shares and $2 million cash in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sunway Kids. The $2 million cash consideration is payable in five installments over five years according to certain earn-out schedule. Sunway Kids thereby became our wholly owned subsidiary.\n\nSunway Kids was established on February 29, 2012, under the laws of the British Virgin Islands as an offshore holding company. On August 23, 2018, Sunway Kids established its wholly owned subsidiary, Brave Millenium Limited (“**Brave Millenium** ”) under the laws of Hong Kong. On December 4, 2019, Brave Millenium established Chengdu Hengshanghui Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. (“**Chengdu Hengshanghui** ”) in China as a wholly foreign owned limited liability company. On December 9, 2019, Chengdu Hengshanghui entered into a series of variable interest entity agreements with Chengdu Hengshanghui Education Consulting Co., Ltd. (“**Hengshanghui Education** ”). Through Sunway Kids and its variable interest entity Hengshanghui Education, we are engaged in providing education and health services to day-cares and preschools in China.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\n_Ready-Mixed Concrete Business_\n\nOur concrete sales business is comprised of the formulation, production and delivery of the Company’s line of C10-C100 concrete mixtures primarily through our current fixed plant, a ready mix concrete batching plant in Beijing. The ready-mixed concrete sales business engages principally in the formulation, preparation and delivery of ready-mixed concrete to the worksites of our customers. We procure raw materials, mix them according to our measured mixing formula, ship the final products in mounted transit mixers to the destination work site, and, for more sophisticated structures, pump the mixture and set it into structural frame molds as per structural design parameters. The process of delivering and setting the ready mix concrete mixture cannot exceed 90 minutes because the chemistry of concrete mixture hardens thereafter. The deliverable radius of a concrete mixture from our ready mix plant in Beijing is approximately 25 kilometers. Traffic conditions would affect the timing and shipment of our concrete mixtures. Since the 2008 Olympics, there are alternating license plate traffic restrictions on many traffic routes in Beijing to ease traffic congestion and associated exhaust pollution. Due to the large amounts of working capital required for the acquisition of raw materials, a supply shortage or degradation of supplier accounts payable credit terms would pose a potential risk to our business.\n\nOur Industry was influenced by the decline in the macro economy in recent years. The concrete products industry experienced a slowdown in industry production and economic growth in the last few years. . In 2017, the pressure on small concrete companies has further increased and many have been shut down.\n\nAs a result of the continued decline in the concrete business, management explored possibility to divert its business to other concrete related sectors. However, it turned out the industry-wide recession makes it very difficult, if possible, to turn around the business in a cost-efficient manner. As such, management then started to explore opportunities in other industry, including acquisition of business or assets.\n\n_Early Childhood Education Service Business_\n\nManagement started to get in touch with Sunway Kids around September 2019. Sunway Kids is an education service provider to day-care and preschools in China. Sunway Kids has a highly skilled professional team experienced in early childhood development. It provides a well-structured system for early childhood education, including AI and robotic technologies, intellectual campus administration software as a service system (“**SAAS System** ”) and online education courses for kids and parents. Sunway Kids provides personalized growth plans for each child based on the analysis of performance data. Sunway Kids helps schools in increasing their education quality as well as generating derivative revenues by providing targeted courses and AI lessons for kids. Sunway Kids believes its ability to cooperate closely with various schools and research institutes in China has contributed to its significant position in the industry.\n\nManagement believes that the convergence of artificial intelligence and education is an emerging and high growth industry. According to Deloitte’s estimation in its 2018 China Education Development Report (Deloitte China Report), China’s education market will reach RMB2.68 trillion (approximately US$383 billion) by 2018 with training organizations, Kto12 and Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) education and private kindergartens comprising the three largest segments. The total scale of private education is expected to reach RMB3.36 trillion (approximately US$480 billion) by 2020 and approach RMB5 trillion (approximately US$714 billion) by 2025 with an annual growth rate (AGR) of 10.8%. Concurrently, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in education is estimated to grow substantially with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 51% from 2018 to 2024 in the Asia Pacific region, with China leading investments in technology and accounting for 17% of the global external investments in AI (Global Market Insights, Asia Pacific in 2019). Specifically, China’s government is building awareness and knowledge of AI through its emphasis on “data and information” and has begun to proactively include AI education into K-12 schools (Deloitte China Report). We believe that the use of artificial intelligence in education will continue to expand in terms of industry scale and market activity in the near future due to a combination of supportive government policies, increased digitalization activities and increased investment by Chinese players in the region.\n\nWith the introduction of the national two-child policy in China since 2015, the birth rate has been increasing and thus provides a guaranteed increase in opportunity for the preschool education industry. With the deepening of China’s economic reforms, the disposable income of urban residents has continued to increase. With the improvement of living standards of urban residents, families have become more willing to invest in education, training, and other services for their children starting at a young age, and at the same time have begun to attach more importance to the branding of the education. At present, China’s preschool education and intelligent education markets are highly fragmented, small in scale, independent, and loosely managed. Branding and franchising will therefore become the inevitable trend of development in the intelligent education industry. Management believes with its experience in AI technology and the Company’s advantage as a U.S. public company, acquisition of Sunway Kids will increase revenue and create value for our shareholders.\n\n3\n\nAs such, the Company entered into a letter of intent with Sunway Kids and its shareholders on October 31, 2019 for a potential acquisition. On December 31, 2019, we entered into certain Share Exchange Agreement with Sunway Kids and its shareholders. The acquisition was consummated on February 14, 2020.\n\nSunway Kids provides its products and services to kindergartens, vocational schools, training schools and other education institutions. Its current products and services are categorized as follows: (1) U Campus SAAS System; (2) Childhood AI Analysis Service; (3) Targeted Teaching Programs Consulting Service for Preschool Children; and (4) Online Education Service.\n\n_U Campus SAAS System_\n\nSunway Kids provides a smart school management SAAS System with U Campus, an online service that provides a package of comprehensive support for the operation and management of preschool education institutions, including student management, employee management, financial management, attendance management and health management. Through U Campus, subscribers are able to handle essential school functions such as adding new classes, enrolling new students and receiving tuition, all online in one place.\n\nU Campus is constantly maintained and updated by Shenzhen Qianhai Peiwen Technology Co., Ltd., our contracted third-party service provider, to provide effective, intuitive, and secure services to our subscribers.\n\n_Childhood AI Analysis Service_\n\nSunway Kids provides schools with monitoring equipment which utilizes AI technology to record and analyze key information about the children in real time, such as emotions, movement, concentration and points of interest. The information is automatically compiled into intuitive data reports that are used to create targeted teaching programs for the children to maximize effectiveness.\n\n_Targeted Teaching Programs Consulting Service for Preschool Children_\n\nThe data reports generated from the AI monitoring equipment are provided to Sichuan Lanjingling Enterprise Management Co., Ltd. (“**Lanjingling** ”), our contracted third-party service provider, which then creates customized curriculum based on the data in the reports. Sunway Kids sells the customized curriculum back to the schools.\n\n_Online Education Service_\n\nSunway Kids offers an English as a Second Language (“**ESL** ”) curriculum named Precise Mind (“**Precise Mind** ”) to kindergartens in China, supplementing their existing English curriculum. The Precise Mind curriculum is divided into multiple levels, each tailored to a specific age group of children and their learning levels. Precise Mind is designed to educate children from a young age with ESL while including fun and engaging activities that create an enjoyable and effective teaching structure for the children. Precise Mind offers online lessons taught by professional native English speaking ESL teachers, who are contracted from Lanjingling. These teachers provide live broadcasted English lessons that last for 45 minutes per session and are usually held 1 to 2 times per week. Through combining our Precise Mind curriculum with each school’s existing English curriculum, we believe students have been able to achieve outstanding results.:\n\nSunway Kids has generated approximately $935,000 of revenue and $263,000 of net income as of December 31, 2019, although these numbers are unaudited.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates our current corporate structure:\n\n![](image_002.jpg)\n\n**_Corporate Information_**\n\nOur principal executive office is located on the 9 North West Fourth Ring Road, Yingu Mansion Ste 1708, Haidian District, Beijing 100190. Our telephone number is +86 10 82525361. We maintain a website at www.china-acm.com that contains information about our Company, though no information contained on our website is part of this prospectus.\n\n4\n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth under “Risk Factors” described in our most recent annual report on Form 20-F, filed on November 15, 2019, as supplemented and updated by subsequent current reports on Form 6-K that we have filed with the SEC, together with all other information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement and in any related free writing prospectus in connection with a specific offering, before making an investment decision. Each of the risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects, as well as the value of an investment in our securities, and the occurrence of any of these risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\n\nIn addition to the risk factors referenced above, as described in our most recent annual report on Form 20-F, we want to disclose the additional risk factors below.\n\n**Risks Related to our Acquisition of Sunway Kids International Education Group Ltd.**\n\n**_We may not be able to oversee the combined entity efficiently._**\n\nWe may not be able to oversee the combined entity efficiently, realize anticipated profits or effectively implement our growth and operating strategies. We are now managing two unrelated businesses which are not synergistic and have completely different customers, suppliers, and competition landscapes. This involves risks that could adversely affect our operating results due to uncertainties involved with the new business, diversion of management’s attention in operating the new business. There can be no guarantee that the addition of the new business will not cause us to incur additional debt and increase our exposure to market and other risks. Our failure to successfully pursue our strategies or effectively operate the combined entity could also have a material adverse effect on our rate of growth and operating performance.\n\n**Risks Related to our Education Service Business**\n\n**_Our education service revenue model depends on developing a subscriber base of users. If we fail to reach a critical mass of subscribers, our net revenues may decline, and we may not be able to implement our business plan._**\n\nWe expect to generate revenue primarily from the fees we collect from our users. It is critical for us to enroll subscribers in a cost-effective manner. Some of the factors, many of which are largely beyond our control, could prevent us from successfully increasing subscriptions in a cost-effective manner, or at all. These factors include, among other things, (i) reduced interest in the products and services we offer; (ii) negative publicity or perceptions regarding us, or electronic education services in general; (iii) the emergence of alternative technologies not offered by us; (iv) the inability of subscribers to pay the fees; (v) increasing market competition, particularly price reductions by competitors that we are unable or unwilling to match; and (vi) adverse changes in relevant government policies or general economic conditions. If one or more of these factors reduce market demand for our services, our subscriber base could be negatively affected or our costs associated with subscriber acquisition and retention could increase, or both, any of which could materially affect our ability to grow our gross billings and net revenues. These developments could also harm our brand and reputation, which would negatively impact our ability to establish or expand our business.\n\n**_Our education service business and growth will be highly dependent on the development of AI childhood education industries in China._**\n\nMainland China is a key driver of revenues and growth in our business plan. Our business plan assumes that we will be able to successfully develop our AI childhood education business in mainland China. The evolution of the AI childhood education is affected by a number of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\n(1) | Penetration and usage by schools, teachers, parents and students, as well as government support over AI childhood education, in relation to its related products and services;  \n---|---  \n(2) | The availability, reliability and security of AI childhood education platforms;  \n---|---  \n(3) | The growth of broadband and advanced technology, including mobile internet and 5G;  \n---|---  \n(4) | The emergence of alternative business models that better suits or becomes a substitute which suits the needs of consumers in the countries we serve; and  \n---|---  \n(5) | Changes in laws and regulations, as well as government policies that govern the AI childhood education industry.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf the AI childhood education industries fail to develop as anticipated in China, our ability to grow our AI childhood education business may be materially and adversely affected.\n\n5\n\n**_We expect to invest in our growth for the foreseeable future. If we fail to manage this growth effectively, the success of our business model will be compromised._**\n\nWe anticipate rapid growth in gross billings and net revenues upon the acquisition of our AI childhood education business segment, which growth is expected to be driven primarily by the growth of our subscriber base. Rapid growth may place a significant strain on our sales and marketing capacities, administrative and operating infrastructure, facilities and other resources. To manage our anticipated our growth, we may need to continue to acquire more subscribers, scale up our product and service offerings, as well as strengthen our platforms and systems. We will also be required to refine our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to efficiently manage the establishment and future expansion of our business, our costs and expenses may increase more than we plan and we may not successfully attract a sufficient number of subscribers and strategic partners in a cost-effective manner, respond to competitive challenges, or otherwise execute our business plans. In addition, we may, as part of carrying out our growth strategies, adopt new initiatives to offer additional educational content and to implement new pricing models and strategies. We cannot assure you that these initiatives may achieve the anticipated results. These proposed changes may not be well received by our existing and prospective users, in which case their experience with our education services may suffer, which could damage our reputation and business prospects.\n\nOur ability to effectively implement our strategies and manage any significant growth of our business will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to: (i) identify and effectively market our products and services in new markets with sufficient growth potential; (ii) develop and improve service and product offerings to make them appealing to our users; (iii) maintain and increase our subscriber base; (iv) effectively recruit, train and motivate a large number of new employees, including sales and marketing personnel; (v) successfully implement enhancements and improvements to the systems and platforms; (vi) continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and efficiencies; (vii) protect and further develop our intellectual property rights; and (viii) make sound business decisions in light of the scrutiny associated with operating as a public company. These activities require significant capital expenditures and investment of valuable management and financial resources, and our growth will continue to place significant demands on our management. There are no guarantees that we will be able to effectively manage any future growth in an efficient, cost-effective and timely manner, or at all. If we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, our reputation, results of operations and overall business and prospects could be negatively impacted.\n\n**_We expect to rely heavily on information and technology to operate our existing and future education products and services, and any cybersecurity incident or other disruption to our AI and technology infrastructure could result in the loss of critical confidential information or adversely impact our reputation, business or results of operations._**\n\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and to compete effectively depends in part upon the satisfactory performance and reliability of our technology network, including the ability to provide features of services that are important to our customers and to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers. We also rely on our technology to maintain and process various operating and financial data that are essential to the day-to-day operation of our business (i.e. AI Classroom) and formulation of our development strategies. Our business operations and growth prospects depend on our ability to maintain and make timely and cost-effective enhancements and upgrades to our technology system and to introduce innovative additions that can meet changing operational needs in future. Therefore, we expect to continue to invest in advanced information technology and any equipment to enhance operational efficiency and reliability as we grow. Accordingly, any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our IT infrastructure could damage our reputation, decrease user satisfaction and retention, adversely impact our ability to attract new users and expand our service and product offerings, and materially disrupt our operations. If any of these occur, our business operations, reputation and prospects could be harmed.\n\n**_If our security measures are breached or fail and result in unauthorized disclosure of data by our employees or our third-party agents, we could lose existing subscribers, fail to attract new subscribers and be exposed to protracted and costly litigation._**\n\nMaintaining platform security is of critical importance to our subscribers because the platform stores and transmits proprietary and confidential information, which may include sensitive personally identifiable information that may be subject to stringent legal and regulatory obligations. As an electronic education service provider, we face an increasing number of threats to our IT infrastructure, including unauthorized activity and access by our employees or third-party agents, system viruses, worms, malicious code and organized cyber-attacks, which could breach our security and disrupt our business. We hope to introduce data security and confidentiality protocols into the cooperation agreements we enter into with third-party sales agents with whom we share prospective subscribers’ contact information. As we expand, we hope to invest in improving our technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans to prevent unauthorized access of confidential or sensitive personal information by our employees and third-party sales agents in the process of engaging prospective subscribers.\n\nThese measures, however, may not be as effective as we anticipate. In addition, there is no assurance that our third-party sales agents will comply with contractual and legal requirements with respect to data privacy when they collect data from our prospective customers. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, we could be subject to liability or our business could be interrupted, potentially over an extended period of time. Any or all of these issues could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to attract and enroll prospective subscribers, cause prospective subscribers not to enroll or stay enrolled, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability. Further, any reputational damage resulting from breach of our security measures could create distrust of our company by prospective subscribers or investors. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of these disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such disruptions or breaches.\n\n6\n\n**_Privacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage our user data and disclosure of user data could adversely impact our business and reputation._**\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business and in particular in connection with conducting sales and marketing activities with our existing and prospective subscribers as well as the utilization of our AI-powered platform programs, we collect and utilize data supplied by our users. We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings under existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use data, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were to disclose data about our users in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we could face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results.\n\nInternationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\n\n**_We face risks associated with uncertainties surrounding PRC laws and regulations governing the education industry in general, including the Law for Promoting Private Education and its Implementation Rules._**\n\nPursuant to the Administrative Regulations on Educational Websites and Online and Distance Education Schools promulgated by the Ministry of Education of the PRC, or the MOE, on July 5, 2000, “educational websites and online education schools” that provide educational services in relation to higher education, elementary education, pre-school education, teaching education, occupational education, adult and other education and public educational information services, are subject to approval from competent education authorities, depending on the type of education service provided. In February 2016, the State Council issued a government decision which explicitly withdrew the above-mentioned approval requirement. On November 7, 2016, China’s National People’s Congress passed an amendment to the Promotion of Private Education Law, or the Amendment, which became effective on September 1, 2017. The Amendment applies different regulatory requirements to non-profit and for-profit private schools.\n\nIn December 2016, several PRC government agencies, including the MOE, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, or the SAIC, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Welfare, jointly promulgated the Implementation Rules on the Supervision and Administration of For-profit Private Schools, or the Implementation Rules. Under the Implementation Rules, the establishment, division, merger or any other material change in a for-profit private school shall be approved by the competent education authorities or the authorities in charge of labor and social welfare and be registered with the competent local branch of SAIC, and a duly approved private school will be granted a private school operating permit. The Implementation Rules also provide that the provisions contained therein should be applicable to “for-profit private training institutions” in an analogous manner.\n\nAs of the date of this current report, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to any penalties or disciplinary action from government authorities due to our lack of a private school operating permit for our electronic education services. Nonetheless, the current PRC laws and regulations, including the Amendment and the Implementation Rules, remain unclear as to whether the requirement for a private school operating permit is applicable to an electronic education service provider. We cannot assure you that the PRC government will not in the future require us to obtain a private school operating permit, given the lack of clear and consistent statutory interpretation regarding the implementation of the Amendment and the Implementation Rules and other relevant laws and regulations. If the PRC government requires us to obtain a private school operating permit or introduces additional amendments and guidelines to expand the coverage of the Amendment to explicitly cover electronic education service providers, and if we fail to do so, we may be subject to fines up to five times the illegitimate gains generated from the provision of training services without a proper license, other administrative sanctions, such as being ordered to refund payments to users, or criminal liabilities, for our lack of a private school operating permit. In addition, uncertainties exist as new laws and regulations, including without limitation the for review draft of Implementation Rules of the Promotion of Private Education Law, or the draft Implementation Rules, published by the Ministry of Justice in August, 2018, may require online education service providers to obtain private school operating permit or make filing with its competent provincial department of education or department of human resources and social security. It is uncertain when the draft would be signed into law and whether the final version would have any substantial changes from the draft. If enacted as the draft, we may be unable to obtain the private school operating permit or complete the required filing in a prompt manner or incur additional costs in complying with relevant requirements, which may adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. We may also be subject to regulatory requirements that are more stringent than the ones currently applicable to us, including those relating to sales and marketing, courses and educational content offerings, teachers’ qualification, as well as tuition fee rates and tuition refund policies, or laws and regulations that require us to obtain and maintain additional licenses and permits, and we may incur substantial expenses or alter or change our business to comply with these requirements. If any of the foregoing were to happen, our business operations may be disrupted, and our financial condition, results of operations and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.\n\n7\n\n**_We face regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to the licensing requirement for the online transmission of internet audio-visual programs._**\n\nOn December 20, 2007, the National Radio and Television Administration fka known as the State Administration of Press Publication Radio Film and Television, or SAPPRFT, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, jointly promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Internet Audio Visual Program Services, or the Audio Visual Program Provisions, which became effective on January 31, 2008 and were amended on August 28, 2015. Among other things, the Audio Visual Program Provisions stipulate that no entities or individuals may provide Internet audio-visual program services without a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs issued by SAPPRFT or completing the relevant filing with SAPPRFT or its local bureaus, and only state-owned or state-controlled entities are eligible to apply for a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs. On April 1, 2010, SAPPRFT promulgated the Provisional Implementations of Tentative Categories of Internet Audio Visual Program Services, or the Categories, which clarified the scope of Internet audio-visual programs services, which was amended on March 10, 2017. According to the Categories, there are four categories of Internet audio-visual program services which are further divided into seventeen sub-categories. Sub-category No. 3 to the second category covers the making and editing of certain specialized audio-visual programs concerning, among other things, educational content, and broadcasting such content to the general public online. Sub-category No. 5 of the first category and sub-category No. 7 of the second category cover the live broadcasting of important political, martial, economic, social, cultural, sports activities or events or general social or community cultural activities, sports games and other organized activities. However, there are still significant uncertainties relating to the interpretation and implementation of the Audio Visual Program Provisions, in particular, the scope of “internet audio-visual programs.” See “Regulations Relating to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs.”\n\nWe plan to deliver our courses in live streaming format. Our teachers and students communicate and interact live with each other via our virtual learning community. The audio and video data will likely be transmitted through the platforms between specific recipients instantly without any further redaction. We believe the nature of the raw data we transmit will distinguish us from general providers of internet audio-visual program services, such as the operator of online video websites, and the provision of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions are not applicable with regard to our offering of the courses. However, we cannot assure you that the competent PRC government authorities will not ultimately take a view contrary to our opinion. In addition, we also plan to offer video recordings of live streaming courses and certain other audio-video contents on our electronic platforms to our students as supplementary course materials on our platforms. If the government authorities determine that our offering of the courses fall within the relevant category of Internet audio-visual program services under the Categories, we may be required to obtain the License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs.\n\nThe Categories describe “Internet audio-visual program services” in a very broad, vague manner and are unclear as to whether electronic courses, whether delivered in a live streaming format or through video recordings, fall into the definition of audio-visual programs. We have made inquiries to the relevant bureaus of SAPPRFT and were informed that online educational content provided through live streaming or recorded courses does not fall within the scope of internet audio-visual programs, the transmission of which does not require a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs. We cannot assure you that the PRC government will not ultimately take a view that live streaming or recorded courses or any other content offered on our platforms are subject to the Audio Visual Program Provisions. We currently do not hold a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs, and since we are not a state-owned or state-controlled entity, we are not eligible to apply for such license. If the PRC government determines that our content should be considered as “internet audio- visual programs” for the purpose of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, we may be required to obtain a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs. We are, however, not eligible apply for such license since we are not a state-owned or state-controlled entity. If this were to occur, we may be subject to penalties, fines, legal sanctions or an order to suspend the provision of our live streaming courses. As of the date of this annual report, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities regarding the lack of a License for Online Transmission of Audio Visual Programs in conducting of our business.\n\n**_Our failure to obtain and maintain approvals, licenses or permits applicable to our business could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations._**\n\nA number of PRC regulatory authorities, such as the SAIC, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the MITT, the National Radio and Television Administration, and the State Council Information Office, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Welfare, oversee different aspects of our business operations. We may be required in the future to obtain additional government approvals, licenses and permits in connection with our operations.\n\nBy way of example, depending upon regulatory interpretation, under the current PRC laws and regulations, the provision of our educational content through our electronic platform may be considered “online publishing” and may require us to obtain an Internet Publishing License, which we currently do not have.\n\nAs of the date of this registration statement, we have not received any notice of warning or been subject to penalties or other disciplinary action from the relevant governmental authorities regarding the lack of any the above-mentioned approvals, licenses or permits. However, we cannot guarantee that the government authorities will not impose any penalties or sanctions on us in the future, which may include warnings, fines, mandates to remedy any violations, confiscation of the gains derived from the services for which approvals, licenses or permits are required, and/or an order to cease to provide such services. In addition, we cannot guarantee that the government will not promulgate new laws and regulations that require additional licenses, permits and/or approvals for the operation of any of our existing or future business. If we are unable to obtain such licenses, permits, or approvals in a timely fashion, we could be subject to penalties and operational disruption and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n8\n\n**_We face intense competition which could adversely affect our results of operations and market share._**\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is sensitive to price, content (i.e. curriculum) and quality of service. Some of our competitors may have more financial resources, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do, or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to raise capital and enter into strategic relationships more easily. We also compete with leading domestic supplier companies based on a number of factors including business model, operational capabilities, cost control and service quality, as well as in-house delivery capabilities to serve their logistics needs and compete with us.\n\nWe are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that affect many other businesses, include but not limited to:\n\n(1) | Increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare benefits;  \n---|---  \n(2) | The increasing costs of compliance with federal, state and foreign governmental agency mandates;  \n---|---  \n(3) | Any impacts on our business resulting from new domestic and international government laws and regulation;  \n---|---  \n(4) | Market conditions in the AI childhood education industry or the economy as a whole;  \n---|---  \n(5) | Market acceptance of our new service and growth initiatives;  \n---|---  \n(6) | Announcements of the introduction of new products and services by our competitors;  \n---|---  \n(7) | The impact of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our products and services;  \n---|---  \n(8) | Developments concerning current or future strategic collaborations;  \n---|---  \n(9) | Widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf we are unable to respond to these changing market conditions, our business and financial results may be materially affected.\n\n**_We face risks related to health epidemics that could impact our sales and operating results._**\n\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Any outbreak of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, particularly in China, could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. These could include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers. Any disruption or delay of our suppliers, manufacturers or customers would likely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of China and many other countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect the value of RMB, demand for our products and significantly impact our operating results.\n\n**USE OF PROCEEDS**\n\nExcept as described in any prospectus supplement and any free writing prospectus in connection with a specific offering, we currently intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities offered under this prospectus to fund the development and commercialization of our projects and the growth of our business, primarily working capital, and for general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in technologies, products and/or businesses that we believe will enhance the value of our Company, although we have no current commitments or agreements with respect to any such transactions as of the date of this prospectus. We have not determined the amount of net proceeds to be used specifically for the foregoing purposes. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds of any sale of the securities. If a material part of the net proceeds is to be used to repay indebtedness, we will set forth the interest rate and maturity of such indebtedness in a prospectus supplement. Pending use of the net proceeds will be deposited in interest bearing bank accounts. \n\n**DILUTION**\n\nIf required, we will set forth in a prospectus supplement the following information regarding any material dilution of the equity interests of investors purchasing securities in an offering under this prospectus:\n\n● | the net tangible book value per share of our equity securities before and after the offering;   \n---|---  \n● | the amount of the increase in such net tangible book value per share attributable to the cash payments made by purchasers in the offering; and   \n● | the amount of the immediate dilution from the public offering price which will be absorbed by such purchasers.   \n  \n9\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF SHARE CAPITAL**\n\nThe following description of our capital stock (which includes a description of securities we may offer pursuant to the registration statement of which this prospectus, as the same may be supplemented, forms a part) does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (“M&A”) and by the applicable provisions of Cayman Islands law.\n\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 75,000,000 Ordinary Shares. As of February 25, 2020, there were 9,563,888 Ordinary Shares and no preferred shares outstanding.\n\nThe following description of our capital stock is intended as a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our M&A, which have been filed previously with the SEC, and applicable provisions of Cayman Islands law.\n\nWe, directly or through agents, dealers or underwriters designated from time to time, may offer, issue and sell, together or separately, up to $50,000,000 in the aggregate of:\n\n●| ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n●| preferred shares;  \n---|---  \n●| secured or unsecured debt securities consisting of notes, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness which may be senior debt securities, senior subordinated debt securities or subordinated debt securities, each of which may be convertible into equity securities;  \n---|---  \n●| warrants to purchase our securities;  \n---|---  \n●| rights to purchase our securities; or  \n---|---  \n●| units comprised of, or other combinations of, the foregoing securities.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe may issue the debt securities as exchangeable for or convertible into Ordinary Shares, preferred shares or other securities. The preferred shares may also be exchangeable for and/or convertible into Ordinary Shares, another series of preferred shares or other securities. The debt securities, the preferred shares, the Ordinary Shares and the warrants are collectively referred to in this prospectus as the “securities.” When a particular series of securities is offered, a supplement to this prospectus will be delivered with this prospectus, which will set forth the terms of the offering and sale of the offered securities.\n\n**Ordinary Shares**\n\nAs of February 25, 2020, there were 9,563,888 Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding, held of record by approximately 390 shareholders. We have never paid dividends on our Ordinary Shares. While any future dividends will be determined by our directors after consideration of the earnings, financial condition, and other relevant factors, it is currently expected that available cash resources will be utilized in connection with our ongoing operations.\n\nEach outstanding Ordinary Share entitles the holder thereof to one vote per share on all matters. Our M&A provide that elections for directors shall be by a plurality of votes. Shareholders do not have preemptive rights to purchase shares in any future issuance of our Ordinary Shares. Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and after payment of creditors and preferred shareholders, if any, our assets will be divided pro-rata on a share-for-share basis among the holders of the Ordinary Shares.\n\nThe holders of our Ordinary Shares are entitled to dividends out of funds legally available when and as declared by our board of directors (the “Board”). The Board has never declared a dividend and does not anticipate declaring a dividend in the foreseeable future. Should we decide in the future to pay dividends, as a holding company, our ability to do so and meet other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our operating subsidiaries and other holdings and investments. In addition, our operating subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including as a result of restrictive covenants in loan agreements, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency and other regulatory restrictions. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive, ratably, the net assets available to stockholders after payment of all creditors.\n\n_Transfer of Ordinary Shares_\n\nSubject to the restrictions set out below, any of our shareholders may transfer all or any of his, its or her Ordinary Shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or any other form approved by the Board or in a form prescribed by the stock exchange on which our shares are then listed.\n\nThe Board may, in its sole discretion, decline to register any transfer of Ordinary Shares whether or not it is fully paid up to the total consideration paid for such shares. The Board may also decline to register any transfer of any Ordinary Shares if (a) the instrument of transfer is not accompanied by the certificate covering the shares to which it relates or any other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor to, or his/her right to transfer the shares; or (b) the instrument of transfer is in respect of more than one class of shares.\n\n10\n\nIf the Board refuses to register a transfer, they shall, within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to the transferee notice of such refusal.\n\nThe registration of transfers may be suspended and the register closed at such times and for such periods as the Board may from time to time determine, provided, however, that the registration of transfers shall not be suspended nor the register closed for more than 30 days in any year.\n\n_Winding-Up/Liquidation_\n\nOn a return of capital on winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares), a liquidator may be appointed to determine how to distribute the assets among the holders of the Ordinary Shares. If our assets available for distribution are insufficient to repay all of the paid-up capital, the assets will be distributed so that the losses are borne by our shareholders proportionately; a similar basis will be employed if the assets are more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital at the commencement of the winding up.\n\n_Calls on Ordinary Shares and Forfeiture of Ordinary Shares_\n\nThe Board may from time to time make calls upon shareholders for any amounts unpaid on their Ordinary Shares in a notice served to such shareholders at least 14 days prior to the specified time and place of payment. The shares that have been called upon and remain unpaid on the specified time are subject to forfeiture.\n\n_Redemption of Shares_\n\nWe may issue shares on terms that are subject to redemption, at our option or at the option of the holders, on such terms and in such manner as may be determined by the Board.\n\n_Variations of Rights of Shares_\n\nAll or any of the special rights attached to any class of shares may, be varied with the resolution of at least two thirds of the issued shares of that class or a resolution passed at a general meeting of the holders of the shares of that class present in person or by proxy or with the consent in writing of the holders of at least two-thirds of the issued shares of that class.\n\n_Inspection of Books and Records_\n\nThe Board shall from time to time determine whether and to what extent and at what times and places and under what conditions or regulations the accounts and books of the Company or any of them shall be open to the inspection of members not on the Board and no member (not on the Board) shall have any right of inspecting any account or book or document of the Company except as conferred by Companies Law or authorized by the Board or by the Company in a general meeting. However, the Board shall from time to time cause to be prepared and to be laid before the Company in a general meeting, profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, group accounts (if any) and such other reports and accounts as may be required by Companies Law. (See “Where You Can Find More Information”)\n\n_Issuance of Additional Shares_\n\nOur M&A authorizes the Board to issue additional Ordinary Shares from time to time as the Board shall determine, to the extent there are available authorized but unissued shares.\n\nIssuance of additional shares may dilute the voting power of holders of Ordinary Shares. However, our M&A provides for authorized share capital comprising Ordinary Shares and to the extent the rights attached to any class may be varied, the Company must comply with the provisions in the M&A relating to variations to rights of shares.\n\n_Exempted Company_\n\nWe are an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Law. The Companies Law distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. A Cayman Islands exempted company:\n\n● | is a company that conducts its business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands;  \n---|---  \n● | is exempted from certain requirements of the Companies Law, including the filing an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies or the Immigration Board;  \n● | does not have to make its register of members open for inspection;  \n● | does not have to hold an annual general meeting;  \n  \n11\n\n● | may issue negotiable or bearer shares or shares with no par value (subject to the provisions of the Companies Law);  \n---|---  \n● | may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for 20 years in the first instance); and  \n● | may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands.  \n  \n_Register of Members_\n\nUnder Cayman Islands law, we must keep a register of members and there should be entered therein:\n\n● | the names and addresses of the members, a statement of the shares held by each member, and of the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid, on the shares of each member;  \n---|---  \n● | the date on which the name of any person was entered on the register as a member; and  \n● | the date on which any person ceased to be a member.  \n  \nUnder Cayman Islands law, the register of members of our Company is prima facie evidence of the matters set out therein (i.e. the register of members will raise a presumption of fact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted) and a member registered in the register of members is deemed as a matter of Cayman Islands law to have legal title to the shares as set against its name in the register of members. Once our register of members has been updated, the shareholders recorded in the register of members are deemed to have legal title to the shares set against their name.\n\nIf the name of any person is incorrectly entered in, or omitted from, our register of members, or if there is any default or unnecessary delay in entering on the register the fact of any person having ceased to be a member of our Company, the person or member aggrieved (or any member of our Company or our Company itself) may apply to the Cayman Islands Grand Court for an order that the register be rectified, and the Court may either refuse such application or it may, if satisfied of the justice of the case, make an order for the rectification of the register.\n\n_Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability_\n\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our M&A requires us to indemnify our officers and directors for actions, proceedings, claims, losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (“Indemnified Losses”) incurred in their capacities as such unless such Indemnified Losses arise from dishonesty of such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\n\n**Preferred Shares**\n\nAs all the current authorized share capital is designated as Ordinary Shares, shareholders’ special resolution will be needed to amend the Company’s M&A to alter its authorized share capital if the Company decides to issue preferred shares. After such resolution and amendment, the Board is empowered to allot and/or issue (with or without rights of renunciation), grant options over, offer or otherwise deal with or dispose of any unissued shares of the Company (whether forming part of the original or any increased share capital), either at a premium or at par, with or without preferred, deferred or other special rights or restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, return of capital or otherwise and to such persons, on such terms and conditions, and at such times as the Board may decide and they may allot or otherwise dispose of them to such persons (including any director of the Board) on such terms and conditions and at such time as the Board may determine.\n\nYou should refer to the prospectus supplement relating to the series of preferred shares being offered for the specific terms of that series, including:\n\n●| title of the series and the number of shares in the series;  \n---|---  \n●| the price at which the preferred shares will be offered;  \n---|---  \n●| the dividend rate or rates or method of calculating the rates, the dates on which the dividends will be payable, whether or not dividends will be cumulative or noncumulative and, if cumulative, the dates from which dividends on the preferred shares being offered will cumulate;  \n---|---  \n●| the voting rights, if any, of the holders of preferred shares being offered;  \n---|---  \n  \n12\n\n●| the provisions for a sinking fund, if any, and the provisions for redemption, if applicable, of the preferred shares being offered, including any restrictions on the foregoing as a result of arrearage in the payment of dividends or sinking fund installments;  \n---|---  \n●| the liquidation preference per share;  \n---|---  \n●| the terms and conditions, if applicable, upon which the preferred shares being offered will be convertible into our Ordinary Shares, including the conversion price, or the manner of calculating the conversion price, and the conversion period;  \n---|---  \n●| the terms and conditions, if applicable, upon which the preferred shares being offered will be exchangeable for debt securities, including the exchange price, or the manner of calculating the exchange price, and the exchange period;  \n---|---  \n●| any listing of the preferred shares being offered on any securities exchange;  \n---|---  \n●| a discussion of any material federal income tax considerations applicable to the preferred shares being offered;  \n---|---  \n●| any preemptive rights;  \n---|---  \n●| the relative ranking and preferences of the preferred shares being offered as to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or the winding up of our affairs;  \n---|---  \n●| any limitations on the issuance of any class or series of preferred shares ranking senior or equal to the series of preferred shares being offered as to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or the winding up of our affairs; and  \n---|---  \n●| any additional rights, preferences, qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the series.  \n---|---  \n  \nUpon issuance, the preferred shares will be fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders will have paid their purchase price in full and we may not require them to pay additional funds.\n\nAny preferred share terms selected by the Board could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of our Ordinary Shares or adversely affect the rights and power, including voting rights, of the holders of our Ordinary Shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of holders of our Ordinary Shares will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred shares that may be issued by us in the future. The issuance of preferred shares could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult.\n\n**Description of Debt Securities**\n\nAs used in this prospectus, the term “debt securities” means the debentures, notes, bonds and other evidences of indebtedness that we may issue from time to time. The debt securities will either be senior debt securities, senior subordinated debt or subordinated debt securities. We may also issue convertible debt securities. Debt securities issued under an indenture (which we refer to herein as an Indenture) will be entered into between us and a trustee to be named therein. It is likely that convertible debt securities will not be issued under an Indenture.\n\nThe Indenture or forms of Indentures, if any, will be filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.\n\n_As you read this section, please remember that for each series of debt securities, the specific terms of your debt security as described in the applicable prospectus supplement will supplement and, if applicable, may modify or replace the general terms described in the summary below. The statement we make in this section may not apply to your debt security._\n\nEvents of Default Under the Indenture\n\nUnless we provide otherwise in the prospectus supplement or free writing prospectus applicable to a particular series of debt securities, the following are events of default under the indentures with respect to any series of debt securities that we may issue:\n\n●| if we fail to pay the principal or premium, if any, when due and payable at maturity, upon redemption or repurchase or otherwise;  \n---|---  \n●| if we fail to pay interest when due and payable and our failure continues for certain days;  \n---|---  \n●| if we fail to observe or perform any other covenant contained in the Securities of a Series or in this Indenture, and our failure continues for certain days after we receive written notice from the trustee or holders of at least certain percentage in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the applicable series. The written notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a “Notice of Default”;  \n---|---  \n●| if specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur; and  \n---|---  \n  \n13\n\n●| if any other event of default provided with respect to securities of that series, which is specified in a Board Resolution, a supplemental indenture hereto or an Officers’ Certificate as defined in the Form of Indenture.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe covenant in the Form of Indenture to deliver a certificate to the trustee annually, within certain days after the close of the fiscal year, to show that we are in compliance with the terms of the indenture and that we have not defaulted under the indenture.\n\nNonetheless, if we issue debt securities, the terms of the debt securities and the final form of indenture will be provided in a prospectus supplement. Please refer to the prospectus supplement and the form of indenture attached thereto for the terms and conditions of the offered debt securities. The terms and conditions may or may not include whether or not we must furnish periodic evidence showing that an event of default does not exist or that we are in compliance with the terms of the indenture.\n\nThe statements and descriptions in this prospectus or in any prospectus supplement regarding provisions of the Indentures and debt securities are summaries thereof, do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the Indentures (and any amendments or supplements we may enter into from time to time which are permitted under each Indenture) and the debt securities, including the definitions therein of certain terms.\n\nGeneral\n\nUnless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement, the debt securities will be direct secured or unsecured obligations of our company. The senior debt securities will rank equally with any of our other unsecured senior and unsubordinated debt. The subordinated debt securities will be subordinate and junior in right of payment to any senior indebtedness.\n\nWe may issue debt securities from time to time in one or more series, in each case with the same or various maturities, at par or at a discount. Unless indicated in a prospectus supplement, we may issue additional debt securities of a particular series without the consent of the holders of the debt securities of such series outstanding at the time of the issuance. Any such additional debt securities, together with all other outstanding debt securities of that series, will constitute a single series of debt securities under the applicable Indenture and will be equal in ranking.\n\nShould an indenture relate to unsecured indebtedness, in the event of a bankruptcy or other liquidation event involving a distribution of assets to satisfy our outstanding indebtedness or an event of default under a loan agreement relating to secured indebtedness of our company or its subsidiaries, the holders of such secured indebtedness, if any, would be entitled to receive payment of principal and interest prior to payments on the senior indebtedness issued under an Indenture.\n\nProspectus Supplement\n\nEach prospectus supplement will describe the terms relating to the specific series of debt securities being offered. These terms will include some or all of the following:\n\n●| the title of debt securities and whether they are subordinated, senior subordinated or senior debt securities;  \n---|---  \n●| any limit on the aggregate principal amount of debt securities of such series;  \n---|---  \n●| the percentage of the principal amount at which the debt securities of any series will be issued;  \n---|---  \n●| the ability to issue additional debt securities of the same series;

Except as limited by the applicable Indenture, we will provide these services without charge, other than any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection with the exchange or transfer.\n\nDebt securities may bear interest at a fixed rate or a variable rate as specified in the prospectus supplement. In addition, if specified in the prospectus supplement, we may sell debt securities bearing no interest or interest at a rate that at the time of issuance is below the prevailing market rate, or at a discount below their stated principal amount. We will describe in the applicable prospectus supplement any special federal income tax considerations applicable to these discounted debt securities.\n\nWe may issue debt securities with the principal amount payable on any principal payment date, or the amount of interest payable on any interest payment date, to be determined by referring to one or more currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity indices or other factors. Holders of such debt securities may receive a principal amount on any principal payment date, or interest payments on any interest payment date, that are greater or less than the amount of principal or interest otherwise payable on such dates, depending upon the value on such dates of applicable currency, commodity, equity index or other factors. The applicable prospectus supplement will contain information as to how we will determine the amount of principal or interest payable on any date, as well as the currencies, commodities, equity indices or other factors to which the amount payable on that date relates and certain additional tax considerations.\n\n**Description of Warrants**\n\nWe may issue warrants to purchase our Ordinary Shares or preferred shares. Warrants may be issued independently or together with any other securities that may be sold by us pursuant to this prospectus or any combination of the foregoing and may be attached to, or separate from, such securities. To the extent warrants that we issue are to be publicly-traded, each series of such warrants will be issued under a separate warrant agreement to be entered into between us and a warrant agent. While the terms we have summarized below will apply generally to any warrants that we may offer under this prospectus, we will describe in particular the terms of any series of warrants that we may offer in more detail in the applicable prospectus supplement and any applicable free writing prospectus. The terms of any warrants offered under a prospectus supplement may differ from the terms described below. \n\nWe will file as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, or will incorporate by reference from another report that we file with the SEC, the form of the warrant and/or warrant agreement, if any, which may include a form of warrant certificate, as applicable that describes the terms of the particular series of warrants we may offer before the issuance of the related series of warrants. We may issue the warrants under a warrant agreement that we will enter into with a warrant agent to be selected by us. The warrant agent will act solely as our agent in connection with the warrants and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency or trust for or with any registered holders of warrants or beneficial owners of warrants. The following summary of material provisions of the warrants and warrant agreements is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the form of warrant and/or warrant agreement and warrant certificate applicable to a particular series of warrants. We urge you to read the applicable prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus, as well as the complete form of warrant and/or the warrant agreement and warrant certificate, as applicable, that contain the terms of the warrants. \n\nThe particular terms of any issue of warrants will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to the issue. Those terms may include:\n\n● | the title of the warrants;  \n---|---  \n● | the price or prices at which the warrants will be issued;  \n---|---  \n● | the designation, amount and terms of the securities or other rights for which the warrants are exercisable;  \n---|---  \n  \n16\n\n● | the designation and terms of the other securities, if any, with which the warrants are to be issued and the number of warrants issued with each other security;  \n---|---  \n● | the aggregate number of warrants;  \n---|---  \n● | any provisions for adjustment of the number or amount of securities receivable upon exercise of the warrants or the exercise price of the warrants;  \n---|---  \n● | the price or prices at which the securities or other rights purchasable upon exercise of the warrants may be purchased;  \n---|---  \n● | if applicable, the date on and after which the warrants and the securities or other rights purchasable upon exercise of the warrants will be separately transferable;  \n---|---  \n● | a discussion of any material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to the exercise of the warrants;  \n---|---  \n● | the date on which the right to exercise the warrants will commence, and the date on which the right will expire;  \n---|---  \n● | the maximum or minimum number of warrants that may be exercised at any time;  \n● | information with respect to book-entry procedures, if any; and  \n---|---  \n● | any other terms of the warrants, including terms, procedures and limitations relating to the exchange and exercise of the warrants.  \n---|---  \n  \n_Exercise of Warrants_\n\nEach warrant will entitle the holder of warrants to purchase the number of Ordinary Shares or preferred shares of the relevant class or series at the exercise price stated or determinable in the prospectus supplement for the warrants. Warrants may be exercised at any time up to the close of business on the expiration date shown in the applicable prospectus supplement, unless otherwise specified in such prospectus supplement. After the close of business on the expiration date, if applicable, unexercised warrants will become void. Warrants may be exercised in the manner described in the applicable prospectus supplement. When the warrant holder makes the payment and properly completes and signs the warrant certificate at the corporate trust office of the warrant agent, if any, or any other office indicated in the prospectus supplement, we will, as soon as possible, forward the securities or other rights that the warrant holder has purchased. If the warrant holder exercises less than all of the warrants represented by the warrant certificate, we will issue a new warrant certificate for the remaining warrants. If we so indicate in the applicable prospectus supplement, holders of the warrants may surrender securities as all or part of the exercise price for warrants. \n\nPrior to the exercise of any warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares or preferred shares of the relevant class or series, holders of the warrants will not have any of the rights of holders of Ordinary Shares or preferred shares purchasable upon exercise, including the right to vote or to receive any payments of dividends or payments upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up on the Ordinary Shares or preferred shares purchasable upon exercise, if any. \n\n_Outstanding Warrants_\n\nAs of the date of this prospectus, there are no outstanding warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares.\n\n**_Description of Rights_**\n\nWe may issue rights to purchase our securities. The rights may or may not be transferable by the persons purchasing or receiving the rights. In connection with any rights offering, we may enter into a standby underwriting or other arrangement with one or more underwriters or other persons pursuant to which such underwriters or other persons would purchase any offered securities remaining unsubscribed for after such rights offering. Each series of rights will be issued under a separate rights agent agreement to be entered into between us and one or more banks, trust companies or other financial institutions, as rights agent, that we will name in the applicable prospectus supplement. The rights agent will act solely as our agent in connection with the rights and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency or trust for or with any holders of rights certificates or beneficial owners of rights.\n\nThe prospectus supplement relating to any rights that we offer will include specific terms relating to the offering, including, among other matters:\n\n●| the date of determining the security holders entitled to the rights distribution;  \n---|---  \n●| the aggregate number of rights issued and the aggregate amount of securities purchasable upon exercise of the rights;  \n---|---  \n●| the exercise price;  \n---|---  \n●| the conditions to completion of the rights offering;  \n---|---  \n  \n17\n\n●| the date on which the right to exercise the rights will commence and the date on which the rights will expire; and  \n---|---  \n●| any applicable federal income tax considerations.  \n---|---  \n  \nEach right would entitle the holder of the rights to purchase for cash the principal amount of securities at the exercise price set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. Rights may be exercised at any time up to the close of business on the expiration date for the rights provided in the applicable prospectus supplement. After the close of business on the expiration date, all unexercised rights will become void.\n\nIf less than all of the rights issued in any rights offering are exercised, we may offer any unsubscribed securities directly to persons other than our security holders, to or through agents, underwriters or dealers or through a combination of such methods, including pursuant to standby arrangements, as described in the applicable prospectus supplement.\n\n**_Description of Units_**\n\nThe following description, together with the additional information we may include in any applicable prospectus supplement, summarizes the material terms and provisions of the units that we may offer under this prospectus. While the terms we have summarized below will apply generally to any units that we may offer under this prospectus, we will describe the particular terms of any series of units in more detail in the applicable prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus. The terms of any units offered under a prospectus supplement may differ from the terms described below. However, no prospectus supplement will fundamentally change the terms that are set forth in this prospectus or offer a security that is not registered and described in this prospectus at the time of its effectiveness. \n\nWe will file as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, or will incorporate by reference from another report we file with the SEC, the form of unit agreement that describes the terms of the series of units we may offer under this prospectus, and any supplemental agreements, before the issuance of the related series of units. The following summaries of material terms and provisions of the units are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the unit agreement and any supplemental agreements applicable to a particular series of units. We urge you to read the applicable prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus, as well as the complete unit agreement and any supplemental agreements that contain the terms of the units. \n\nWe may issue units consisting of any combination of the other types of securities offered under this prospectus in one or more series. We may evidence each series of units by unit certificates that we may issue under a separate agreement. We may enter into unit agreements with a unit agent. Each unit agent, if any, may be a bank or trust company that we select. We will indicate the name and address of the unit agent, if any, in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to a particular series of units. Specific unit agreements, if any, will contain additional important terms and provisions. We will file as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, or will incorporate by reference from a current report that we file with the SEC, the form of unit and the form of each unit agreement, if any, relating to units offered under this prospectus.\n\nIf we offer any units, certain terms of that series of units will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement, including, without limitation, the following, as applicable\n\n●| the title of the series of units;  \n---|---  \n●| identification and description of the separate constituent securities comprising the units;  \n---|---  \n●| the price or prices at which the units will be issued;  \n---|---  \n●| the date, if any, on and after which the constituent securities comprising the units will be separately transferable;  \n---|---  \n●| a discussion of certain United States federal income tax considerations applicable to the units; and  \n---|---  \n●| any other material terms of the units and their constituent securities.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe provisions described in this section, as well as those described under “Description of Share Capital - Ordinary Shares and Preferred Shares” and “Description of Warrants” will apply to each unit and to any Ordinary Shares, preferred shares or warrant included in each unit, respectively. \n\n_Issuance in Series_\n\nWe may issue units in such amounts and in numerous distinct series as we determine.\n\n**Transfer Agent and Registrar**\n\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our Ordinary Shares is Action Stock Transfer Corp., located in Salt Lake City, Utah. Their mailing address is 2469 E. Fort Union Blvd, Suite 214, Salt Lake City, UT, 84121. Their phone number is (801) 274-1088.\n\n18\n\n**NASDAQ Capital Market Listing**\n\nOur Ordinary Shares are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “HHT.”\n\n**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**\n\nWe may sell the securities offered through this prospectus (i) to or through underwriters or dealers, (ii) directly to purchasers, including our affiliates, (iii) through agents, or (iv) through a combination of any these methods. The securities may be distributed at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, market prices prevailing at the time of sale, prices related to the prevailing market prices, or negotiated prices. The prospectus supplement will include the following information:\n\n●| the terms of the offering;  \n---|---  \n●| the names of any underwriters or agents;  \n---|---  \n●| the name or names of any managing underwriter or underwriters;  \n---|---  \n●| the purchase price of the securities;  \n---|---  \n●| any over-allotment options under which underwriters may purchase additional securities from us;  \n---|---  \n●| the net proceeds from the sale of the securities;  \n---|---  \n●| any delayed delivery arrangements;  \n---|---  \n●| any underwriting discounts, commissions and other items constituting underwriters’ compensation;  \n---|---  \n●| any initial public offering price;  \n---|---  \n●| any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers;  \n---|---  \n●| any commissions paid to agents; and  \n---|---  \n●| any securities exchange or market on which the securities may be listed.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Sale Through Underwriters or Dealers**\n\nOnly underwriters named in the prospectus supplement are underwriters of the securities offered by the prospectus supplement. If underwriters are used in the sale, the underwriters will acquire the securities for their own account, including through underwriting, purchase, security lending or repurchase agreements with us. The underwriters may resell the securities from time to time in one or more transactions, including negotiated transactions. Underwriters may sell the securities in order to facilitate transactions in any of our other securities (described in this prospectus or otherwise), including other public or private transactions and short sales. Underwriters may offer securities to the public either through underwriting syndicates represented by one or more managing underwriters or directly by one or more firms acting as underwriters. Unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement, the obligations of the underwriters to purchase the securities will be subject to certain conditions, and the underwriters will be obligated to purchase all the offered securities if they purchase any of them. The underwriters may change from time to time any public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers.\n\nIf dealers are used in the sale of securities offered through this prospectus, we will sell the securities to them as principals. They may then resell those securities to the public at varying prices determined by the dealers at the time of resale. The prospectus supplement will include the names of the dealers and the terms of the transaction.\n\nWe will provide in the applicable prospectus supplement any compensation we will pay to underwriters, dealers or agents in connection with the offering of the securities, and any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed by underwriters to participating dealers.\n\n**Direct Sales and Sales Through Agents**\n\nWe may sell the securities offered through this prospectus directly. In this case, no underwriters or agents would be involved. Such securities may also be sold through agents designated from time to time. The prospectus supplement will name any agent involved in the offer or sale of the offered securities and will describe any commissions payable to the agent. Unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement, any agent will agree to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit purchases for the period of its appointment.\n\nWe may sell the securities directly to institutional investors or others who may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act with respect to any sale of those securities. The terms of any such sales will be described in the prospectus supplement.\n\n19\n\n**Delayed Delivery Contracts**\n\nIf the prospectus supplement indicates, we may authorize agents, underwriters or dealers to solicit offers from certain types of institutions to purchase securities at the public offering price under delayed delivery contracts. These contracts would provide for payment and delivery on a specified date in the future. The contracts would be subject only to those conditions described in the prospectus supplement. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the commission payable for solicitation of those contracts.\n\n**Market Making, Stabilization and Other Transactions**\n\nUnless the applicable prospectus supplement states otherwise, other than our Ordinary Shares, all securities we offer under this prospectus will be a new issue and will have no established trading market. We may elect to list offered securities on an exchange or in the over-the-counter market. Any underwriters that we use in the sale of offered securities may make a market in such securities, but may discontinue such market making at any time without notice. Therefore, we cannot assure you that the securities will have a liquid trading market.\n\nAny underwriter may also engage in stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Rule 104 under the Securities Exchange Act. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the underlying security in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the securities. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the securities in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions.\n\nPenalty bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the securities originally sold by the syndicate member are purchased in a syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions. Stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the securities to be higher than it would be in the absence of the transactions. The underwriters may, if they commence these transactions, discontinue them at any time.\n\n**General Information**\n\nAgents, underwriters, and dealers may be entitled, under agreements entered into with us, to indemnification by us against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Our agents, underwriters, and dealers, or their affiliates, may be customers of, engage in transactions with or perform services for us, in the ordinary course of business.\n\n**LEGAL MATTERS**\n\nExcept as otherwise set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement, certain legal matters in connection with the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus will be passed upon for us by Hunter Taubman Fischer & Li LLC to the extent governed by the laws of the State of New York, and by Conyers Dill & Pearman to the extent governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands. If legal matters in connection with offerings made pursuant to this prospectus are passed upon by counsel to underwriters, dealers or agents, such counsel will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to any such offering. \n\n**EXPERTS**\n\nThe financial statements incorporated by reference in this prospectus for the year ended June 30, 2019 have been audited by Wei, Wei & Co., LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as set forth in their report thereon appearing elsewhere herein, and are included in reliance upon such report given on the authority of such firm as experts in accounting and auditing.\n\n**FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\nThe financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 are included in our Annual Report on Form 20-F, which are incorporated by reference into this prospectus.\n\n**INFORMATION INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE**\n\nThe SEC allows us to “incorporate by reference” into this prospectus the information we file with the SEC. This means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you to those documents.

To the extent that any information contained in any Current Report on Form 6-K or any exhibit thereto, was or is furnished to, rather than filed with the SEC, such information or exhibit is specifically not incorporated by reference.\n\nUpon request, we will provide, without charge, to each person who receives this prospectus, a copy of any or all of the documents incorporated by reference (other than exhibits to the documents that are not specifically incorporated by reference in the documents). Please direct written or oral requests for copies to us at 9 North West Fourth Ring Road Yingu Mansion Suite 1708, Haidian District Beijing, People’s Republic of China 100190, Attention: Yang (Sean) Liu, 010-82525361\n\n**WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION**\n\nAs permitted by SEC rules, this prospectus omits certain information and exhibits that are included in the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Since this prospectus may not contain all of the information that you may find important, you should review the full text of these documents. If we have filed a contract, agreement or other document as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, you should read the exhibit for a more complete understanding of the document or matter involved. Each statement in this prospectus, including statements incorporated by reference as discussed above, regarding a contract, agreement or other document is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual document.\n\nWe are subject to the information reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that are applicable to foreign private issuers, and, in accordance with these requirements, we file annual and current reports and other information with the SEC. You may inspect, read (without charge) and copy the reports and other information we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an internet website at  _www.sec.gov_ that contains our filed reports and other information that we file electronically with the SEC.\n\nWe maintain a corporate website at http://www.china-acm.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute a part of this prospectus.\n\n**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**\n\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability. We incorporated in the Cayman Islands because of certain benefits associated with being a Cayman Islands exempted company, such as political and economic stability, an effective judicial system, a favorable tax system, the absence of foreign exchange control or currency restrictions and the availability of professional and support services. However, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of securities laws that provide significantly less protection to investors as compared to the securities laws of the United States. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the United States.\n\nAll of our assets are located in China. In addition, some of our directors and officers are residents of jurisdictions other than the United States and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our directors and officers, or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States.\n\nAccording to our local Cayman Islands’ counsel, there is uncertainty with regard to Cayman Islands law relating to whether a judgment obtained from the United States or Hong Kong courts under civil liability provisions of the securities laws will be determined by the courts of the Cayman Islands as penal or punitive in nature. If such a determination is made, the courts of the Cayman Islands will not recognize or enforce the judgment against a Cayman Islands’ company. The courts of the Cayman Islands in the past determined that disgorgement proceedings brought at the instance of the Securities and Exchange Commission are penal or punitive in nature and such judgments would not be enforceable in the Cayman Islands. Other civil liability provisions of the securities laws may be characterized as remedial, and therefore enforceable but the Cayman Islands’ Courts have not yet ruled in this regard. Our Cayman Islands’ counsel has further advised us that a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of the United States under which a sum of money is payable other than a sum payable in respect of taxes, fines, penalties or similar charges, may be subject to enforcement proceedings as a debt in the courts of the Cayman Islands.\n\n21\n\nAs of the date hereof, no treaty or other form of reciprocity exists between the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong governing the recognition and enforcement of judgments.\n\nCayman Islands’ counsel further advised that although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States or Hong Kong, a judgment obtained in such jurisdictions will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at common law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment (1) is given by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction, (2) imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for which the judgment has been given, (3) is final, (4) is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty, and (5) was not obtained in a manner and is of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands.\n\n**INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES**\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.\n\n22\n\n**3,206,349 Ordinary Shares**\n\n**COLOR STAR TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.**\n\n**Prospectus Supplement**\n\nSeptember 4, 2020\n"
