These results underscore the pre-clinical efficacy of Carisma's engineered macrophages in multiple liver fibrosis models and offer a novel, off-the-shelf potential treatment option for patients with fibrotic liver disease including advanced metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/CARISMA Therapeutics Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1219543/Carisma_Therapeutics_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1219543/Carisma_Therapeutics_Logo.html)\n\nLiver fibrosis is a central late-stage pathway in multiple liver diseases, including MASH, acute liver injury, primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and others. Treatment options remain limited for advanced liver disease patients. Liver disease is characterized by defective efferocytosis (an anti-inflammatory process by which macrophages clear dead hepatocytes), activation of hepatic stellate cells which leads to collagen accumulation, and chronic inflammation.\n\nNew preclinical results demonstrate that macrophages can be genetically engineered to target specific key pathways underlying liver disease with factors including TIM4 (restores efferocytosis), relaxin (inhibits hepatic stellate cell activation), and IL10 (reduces inflammation). Notably, a single dose of macrophages expressing TIM4, alone or together with relaxin, significantly reduced liver fibrosis and hepatic stellate cell activation in the translationally relevant choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) MASH model. The engineered macrophages were well tolerated and outperformed non-engineered cells in all models.\n\n\"We are pleased to present compelling preclinical data supporting the therapeutic potential of our engineered macrophages to address a critical unmet need in liver fibrosis, which is found in advanced stages of MASH,\" said Michael Klichinsky, PharmD, PhD, Co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Carisma. \"These data underscore the efficacy of our engineered macrophages as a differentiated, off-the-shelf approach for treating advanced liver fibrosis. Based on these promising findings, we are committed to advancing our liver fibrosis program.\"\n\nCarisma expects to nominate a development candidate for its liver fibrosis program in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe poster presented at AASLD 2024 is now available online in the \"Publications\" section of Carisma's website at [https://carismatx.com/technology/publications/](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4304462-1&h=228965264&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4160988-1%26h%3D3539177852%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcarismatx.com%252Ftechnology%252Fpublications%252F%26a%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcarismatx.com%252Ftechnology%252Fpublications%252F&a=https%3A%2F%2Fcarismatx.com%2Ftechnology%2Fpublications%2F)\n\n**About Carisma Therapeutics**\n\nCarisma Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on utilizing our proprietary macrophage and monocyte cell engineering platform to develop transformative immunotherapies to treat cancer and other serious diseases.

Additionally, the CAR-M produced pro-inflammatory cytokines and adopted an inflammatory, activated macrophage phenotype upon antigen engagement. In both syngeneic and humanized tumor models, systemic administration of anti-GPC3 CAR mRNA/LNP significantly reduced tumor burden and suppressed metastasis to the liver. The therapy was well tolerated in mouse models, highlighting its potential as an off-the-shelf treatment for GPC3+ solid tumors, including HCC.\n\n\"The data demonstrate our ability to generate anti-GPC3 CAR-M cells directly _in vivo_ using mRNA/LNP technology, leading to significant tumor reduction in translationally relevant pre-clinical models,\" said Michael Klichinsky, PharmD, PhD, Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer at Carisma. \"This novel off-the-shelf approach offers a promising new strategy for treating hepatocellular carcinoma, and we are eager to advance it toward clinical development.\"\n\n\"These preclinical data highlights the successful application of our mRNA/LNP platform in enabling _in vivo_ cell therapy,\" said Lin Guey, PhD, CSO of Therapeutic Research Ventures, Moderna. \"We look forward to further advancing the anti-GPC3 _in vivo_ CAR-M therapy for HCC patients and continuing our collaboration with Carisma to bring innovative treatments to those patients with solid tumors.\"\n\n**About Carisma Therapeutics**\n\nCarisma Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on utilizing our proprietary macrophage and monocyte cell engineering platform to develop transformative immunotherapies to treat cancer and other serious diseases.

These key milestones move us closer to delivering transformative treatments for patients in need.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights and Upcoming Milestones**\n\n__Ex Vivo Oncology__\n\n  * **CT-0525 (Anti-HER2 chimeric antigen receptor monocyte (CAR-Monocyte))**\n    * On November 5, 2024, Carisma announced the upcoming presentation of a trial in progress (TIP) poster for its Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating CT-0525, an autologous CAR-Monocyte therapy for the treatment of HER2+ solid tumors. The poster will be presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting in Houston, Texas, on November 8, 2024.\n    * In September 2024, Carisma submitted a protocol amendment for its Phase 1 study of CT-0525 to allow for the expansion of the study to include repeat dosing (up to two billion CAR positive cells administered every three weeks for up to five cycles) in combination with pembrolizumab, bolus dosing (up to10 billion CAR positive cells in a single dose) in combination with pembrolizumab, or either of these two dosing schedules as monotherapy (without checkpoint inhibitor). Repeat dosing in combination with pembrolizumab will be prioritized and the other three study arms may be activated as data indicates.\n    * Carisma expects to report initial data for Cohorts 1 and 2 of its Phase 1 study of CT-0525 in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n__In Vivo Program (Moderna Collaboration)__\n\n  * **Autoimmune disease (CAR-M + mRNA/LNP)**\n    * On September 10, 2024, Carisma announced the expansion of its _in vivo_ chimeric antigen receptor macrophage and monocyte (\"CAR-M\") collaboration with Moderna, Inc. (\"Moderna\") to include the nomination of two research targets for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Carisma retains all rights in autoimmune disease beyond the two nominated targets, which will be exclusively partnered with Moderna.\n  * **GPC3+ solid tumors (CAR-M + mRNA/LNP)**\n    * On November 5, 2024, Carisma announced the upcoming presentation of new pre-clinical data for its anti-GPC3 _in vivo_ CAR-M therapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), developed in collaboration with Moderna. These data will be presented in a poster session at the SITC Annual Meeting in Houston, Texas, on November 8, 2024. These preclinical data demonstrate robust anti-tumor activity and introduce a novel, off-the-shelf approach for GPC3+ solid tumors.\n\n\n\n__Fibrosis__\n\n  *     * On August 6, 2024, Carisma announced that new preclinical data for liver fibrosis will be highlighted in a poster presentation at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) - The Liver Meeting**®** 2024, to be held November 15 through 19, 2024, in San Diego, California.\n    * Carisma expects to nominate a development candidate for its liver fibrosis program in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Corporate Update**\n\n  * On October 30, 2024, Carisma announced the appointment of Sohanya Cheng to the Board of Directors of the Company, effective October 31, 2024. Ms. Cheng brings over 20 years of experience in biopharmaceutical commercialization and research, with a strong focus on oncology. The Company concurrently announced the resignation of Michael Torok from Carisma's Board of Directors, also effective October 31, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, were $26.9 million, compared to $40.4 million as of June 30, 2024.\n  * Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $11.3 million, compared to $19.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $8.3 million was primarily due to implementation of our revised operating plan in the second quarter of 2024 in which we halted further development of CT-0508, paused development of CT-1119 and implemented a workforce reduction. As result of the revised operating plan, we experienced a decrease of $2.4 million related to halting development of CT-0508 and a $0.1 million decrease from pausing the development of CT-1119. In addition, the implementation of the revised operating plan resulted in a decrease in facilities and other expenses of $3.1 million due to less laboratory supplies and laboratory space needs and a $0.9 million decrease in direct personnel costs due to a reduction in headcount. Further, we experienced a $0.9 million decrease in direct costs associated with pre-clinical development of CT-0525 due to the timing of the development program and a decrease of $0.9 million in other clinical and pre-clinical development expenses resulting from the timing of certain studies in our _in vivo_ collaboration with Moderna.\n  * General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $5.2 million, compared to $6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $1.4 million was primarily due to our revised operating plan in which we recognized a $1.3 million decrease in professional fees as a result of our patent portfolio and expanding infrastructure in 2023, a $0.3 million decrease in facilities and supplies due to a decrease in office expenditures, a $0.2 million decrease in insurance costs, and a $0.1 million decrease in other expenses related to a decline in travel costs, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in personnel costs driven by an increase in stock-based compensation.\n  * Net loss was $12.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a $21.4 million net loss for the same period in 2023.\n\n\n\n**Outlook**\n\nCarisma anticipates that its cash and cash equivalents of $26.9 million as of September 30, 2024 are sufficient to sustain its planned operations into the third quarter of 2025. The Company's cash forecast contains estimates and assumptions, and management cannot predict the timing of all cash receipts and expenditures with certainty. Variances from management's estimates and assumptions could impact the Company's liquidity prior to the third quarter of 2025.\n\n**About CT-0525**\n\nCT-0525 is a first-in-class, _ex vivo_ gene-modified autologous chimeric antigen receptor-monocyte (CAR-Monocyte) cellular therapy intended to treat solid tumors that overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It is being studied in a multi-center, open label, Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with advanced/metastatic HER2-overexpressing solid tumors that have progressed on available therapies. The CAR-Monocyte approach has the potential to address some of the challenges of treating solid tumors with cell therapies, including tumor infiltration, immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment, and antigen heterogeneity. CT-0525 has the potential to enable significant dose escalation, enhance tumor infiltration, increase persistence, and reduce manufacturing time compared to macrophage therapy.\n\n**About Carisma Therapeutics**\n\nCarisma Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on utilizing our proprietary macrophage and monocyte cell engineering platform to develop transformative immunotherapies to treat cancer and other serious diseases.
