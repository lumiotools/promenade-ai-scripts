We also use\nDE in our budgeting, forecasting, and the overall management of our three segments. We believe that reporting DE is helpful to\nunderstanding our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure that management uses to\nanalyze our segment performance. DE is intended to show the amount of net realized earnings without the effects of consolidation\nof the Consolidated Funds. DE is derived from our segment reported results and is an additional measure to assess performance. Fee\nRelated Earnings, or “FRE,” is used to assess the ability of the business to cover direct base compensation and operating expenses from\ntotal fee revenues.\nThe following tables reconcile the Total Segments to our Income (Loss) Before Provision for Income Taxes for the years ended December\n31, 2022 and 2021:\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022\nTotal Reportable Consolidated Reconciling Carlyle\nSegments Funds Items Consolidated\nRevenues $ 4,401.4 $ 311.0 $ (273.7) (a) $ 4,438.7\nExpenses $ 2,492.4 $ 255.3 $ 77.0 (b) $ 2,824.7\nOther income $ — $ (41.5) $ — (c) $ (41.5)\nDistributable earnings $ 1,909.0 $ 14.2 $ (350.7) (d) $ 1,572.5\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021\nTotal Reportable Consolidated Reconciling Carlyle\nSegments Funds Items Consolidated\nRevenues $ 4,950.1 $ 253.2 $ 3,578.8 (a) $ 8,782.1\nExpenses $ 2,706.4 $ 217.8 $ 1,832.9 (b) $ 4,757.1\nOther income $ — $ 2.5 $ — (c) $ 2.5\nDistributable earnings $ 2,243.7 $ 37.9 $ 1,745.9 (d) $ 4,027.5\nCARLYLE ANNUAL REPORT 2022 44\n(A) The Revenues adjustment principally represents unrealized performance revenues, unrealized principal investment income (loss)\n(including Fortitude), the principal investment loss from dilution of the indirect investment in Fortitude, revenues earned from the\nConsolidated Funds which were eliminated in consolidation to arrive at the Company’s total revenues, adjustments for amounts\nattributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, adjustments related to expenses associated with the investments\nin NGP Management and its affiliates that are included in operating captions or are excluded from the segment results, adjustments\nto reflect the reimbursement of certain costs incurred on behalf of Carlyle funds on a net basis, and the inclusion of tax expenses\nassociated with certain foreign performance revenues, as detailed below:\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021\nUnrealized performance revenues $ (142.5) $ 3,155.6\nUnrealized principal investment income (38.3) 351.8\nPrincipal investment loss from dilution of indirect investment in Fortitude (176.9) —\nAdjustments related to expenses associated with investments in NGP\n(12.9) (13.7)\nManagement and its affiliates\nTax expense associated with certain foreign performance revenues 0.1 0.2\nNon-controlling interests and other adjustments to present certain\n119.0 159.6\ncosts on a net basis\nElimination of revenues of Consolidated Funds (22.2) (74.7)\n$ (273.7) $ 3,578.8\nThe following table reconciles the total segments fund level fee revenue to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, the\nCompany’s consolidated fund management fees, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021\nTotal Reportable Segments -
