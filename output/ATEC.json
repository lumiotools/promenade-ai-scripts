The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with an additional tool for evaluating the Company's core performance, which management uses in its own evaluation of continuing operating performance, and a baseline for assessing the future earnings potential of the Company. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. Non-GAAP financial results should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Included below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures. \n\n**About** **Alphatec Holdings, Inc.**\n\nATEC, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Alphatec Spine, Inc., EOS imaging S.A.S. and SafeOp Surgical, Inc., is a medical device company dedicated to revolutionizing the approach to spine surgery through clinical distinction. ATEC’s Organic Innovation Machine TM is focused on developing new approaches that integrate seamlessly with the Company’s expanding AlphaInformatiX Platform to better inform surgery and more safely and reproducibly achieve the goals of spine surgery.

Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The Company cautions investors that there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: references to the Company’s revenue, balance sheet, growth, and financial outlook and commitments; and the Company's ability to compel surgeon adoption, drive procedural growth and transform the sales channel. Important factors that could cause actual operating results to differ significantly from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the uncertainty of success in developing new products or products currently in the pipeline; the uncertainties in the Company’s ability to execute upon its strategic operating plan; the uncertainties regarding the ability to successfully license or acquire new products, and the commercial success of such products; failure to achieve acceptance of the Company’s products by the surgeon community; failure to obtain FDA or other regulatory clearance or approval or unexpected or prolonged delays in the process; continuation of favorable Third-party reimbursement; unanticipated expenses or liabilities or other adverse events affecting cash flow or the Company’s ability to achieve profitability; uncertainty of additional funding and the form of such funding; product liability exposure; an unsuccessful outcome in any litigation; patent infringement claims; claims related to the Company’s intellectual property; and the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations. A further list and description of these and other factors, risks and uncertainties can be found in the Company's most recent annual report, and any subsequent quarterly and current reports, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ATEC disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by law. \n\n**Non-GAAP Definitions**\n\nAmortization of intangible assets: Represents amortization expense associated with intangible assets including, but not limited to customer relationships, intellectual property, and trade names acquired in business combinations and asset acquisitions. \n\nLitigation-related expenses: We are involved in various litigation matters that from time-to-time result in settlements. Litigation matters can vary in their characteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results and core business operations. We review litigation matters from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective to determine whether such matters are a normal and recurring part of our business. We include in our GAAP financial statements litigation fees and settlement expenses that we determine to be normal, recurring and routine to our business. When we determine that certain litigation matters are not normal and recurring to our core business operations, we believe excluding these expenses will provide our management and investors with useful incremental information. Litigation fees and settlement expenses excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures in the periods presented relate primarily to patent litigation and other litigation matters that relate directly to the business transformation that we started in 2018 and are discussed more fully in our periodic reports filed with the Securities Exchange Commission. \n\nOther non-recurring expenses: These expenses represent non-recurring expenses that we consider to be one-time in nature. \n\nPurchase accounting adjustments on acquisitions: Includes non-cash expenses incurred as a result of fair value asset step-ups associated with tangible assets acquired from business combinations or asset acquisitions. \n\nRestructuring expenses: From time-to-time, in order to realign the Company’s operations or to achieve synergies associated with an acquisition, the Company may eliminate roles or restructure its operations and footprint. In such cases the Company may incur one-time severance and personnel costs associated with workforce reductions, or costs associated with exiting and/or relocating facilities. We exclude these costs as we do not consider such amounts to be part of the ongoing operations. \n\nStock-based compensation: Stock-based compensation is charged to cost of revenue and operating expenses. We exclude stock-based compensation from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding these non-cash expenses provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. Because of the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining stock-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the Company’s control, the Company believes excluding stock-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time. \n\nTransaction-related expenses: These expenses represent one-time costs associated with business combinations and asset acquisitions. These items may include but are not limited to consulting and legal fees, contract termination costs and other related deal costs. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA: Represents earnings before non-operating income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted for the applicable non-GAAP adjustments previously described. \n\n**Alphatec Holdings, Inc.** **Condensed Consolidated Statements of

The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with an additional tool for evaluating the Company's core performance, which management uses in its own evaluation of continuing operating performance, and a baseline for assessing the future earnings potential of the Company. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. Non-GAAP financial results should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Included below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures. \n\n**About** **Alphatec Holdings, Inc.**\n\nATEC, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Alphatec Spine, Inc., EOS imaging S.A.S. and SafeOp Surgical, Inc., is a medical device company dedicated to revolutionizing the approach to spine surgery through clinical distinction.

Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The Company cautions investors that there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: references to the Company’s revenue, balance sheet, growth, and financial outlook and commitments; and the Company's ability to compel surgeon adoption and transform the sales channel. Important factors that could cause actual operating results to differ significantly from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the uncertainty of success in developing new products or products currently in the pipeline; the uncertainties in the Company’s ability to execute upon its strategic operating plan; the uncertainties regarding the ability to successfully license or acquire new products, and the commercial success of such products; failure to achieve acceptance of the Company’s products by the surgeon community; failure to obtain FDA or other regulatory clearance or approval or unexpected or prolonged delays in the process; continuation of favorable Third-party reimbursement; unanticipated expenses or liabilities or other adverse events affecting cash flow or the Company’s ability to achieve profitability; uncertainty of additional funding; product liability exposure; an unsuccessful outcome in any litigation; patent infringement claims; claims related to the Company’s intellectual property; and the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations. A further list and description of these and other factors, risks and uncertainties can be found in the Company's most recent annual report, and any subsequent quarterly and current reports, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ATEC disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by law. \n\n**Non-GAAP Definitions**\n\nAmortization of intangible assets: Represents amortization expense associated with intangible assets including, but not limited to customer relationships, intellectual property, and trade names acquired in business combinations and asset acquisitions. \n\nLitigation-related expenses: We are involved in various litigation matters that from time-to-time result in settlements. Litigation matters can vary in their characteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results and core business operations. We review litigation matters from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective to determine whether such matters are a normal and recurring part of our business. We include in our GAAP financial statements litigation fees and settlement expenses that we determine to be normal, recurring and routine to our business. When we determine that certain litigation matters are not normal and recurring to our core business operations, we believe excluding these expenses will provide our management and investors with useful incremental information. Litigation fees and settlement expenses excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures in the periods presented relate primarily to patent litigation and other litigation matters that relate directly to the business transformation that we started in 2018 and are discussed more fully in our periodic reports filed with the Securities Exchange Commission. \n\nOther non-recurring expenses: These expenses represent non-recurring expenses that we consider to be one-time in nature. \n\nPurchase accounting adjustments on acquisitions: Includes non-cash expenses incurred as a result of fair value asset step-ups associated with tangible assets acquired from business combinations or asset acquisitions. \n\nRestructuring expenses: From time-to-time, in order to realign the Company’s operations or to achieve synergies associated with an acquisition, the Company may eliminate roles or restructure its operations and footprint. In such cases the Company may incur one-time severance and personnel costs associated with workforce reductions, or costs associated with exiting and/or relocating facilities. We exclude these costs as we do not consider such amounts to be part of the ongoing operations. \n\nStock-based compensation: Stock-based compensation is charged to cost of revenue and operating expenses. We exclude stock-based compensation from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding these non-cash expenses provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. Because of the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining stock-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the Company’s control, the Company believes excluding stock-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time. \n\nTransaction-related expenses: These expenses represent one-time costs associated with business combinations and asset acquisitions. These items may include but are not limited to consulting and legal fees, contract termination costs and other related deal costs. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA: Represents earnings before non-operating income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted for the applicable non-GAAP adjustments previously described. \n\n**Alphatec Holdings, Inc.** **Condensed Consolidated Statements of

(Nasdaq: ATEC), a provider of innovative solutions dedicated\nto revolutionizing the approach to spine surgery, today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30,\n2024, and recent corporate highlights.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTotal revenue $151 million\nGAAP gross margin 68%\nNon-GAAP gross margin 69%\nGAAP operating expenses $136 million\nNon-GAAP operating expenses $114 million\nGAAP net loss ($40) million\nAdjusted EBITDA $7.4 million\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 5%\nEnding cash balance $81 million\nRecent Highlights\no Drove 20% procedural volume growth on continued momentum of PTPTM and LTPTM;\no Achieved 19% growth in new surgeon adoption, a key leading indicator of future growth;\no Continued to expand U.S. footprint, which fueled over 200 surgeon training engagements;\no Reduced free cash use to $21 million as accelerated investment phase nears completion.\n“At ATEC, our commitment continues to be to enhance spine care through innovation,” said Pat Miles, Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer. “That commitment has fueled growth at multiples of our industry for over five years. We\nrecognize the importance of converting growth to expand profitability so we can support our long-term vision, and we\nare actively executing internal initiatives to impact cash flow. Our view of the opportunity ahead is unchanged: we are\nbuilding a special company that is uniquely positioned to revolutionize spine care.\"\nIncreased Existing Term Debt Facility\n1\nThe Company reached an agreement with Braidwell LP, and Pharmakon Advisors, LP, to expand the Company’s existing\nterm loan by $50 million, availing total capacity of up to $200 million.

The\nCompany believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with an additional tool for evaluating the\nCompany's core performance, which management uses in its own evaluation of continuing operating performance, and a\nbaseline for assessing the future earnings potential of the Company. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may\nnot provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as\nother companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring,\nunusual items. Non-GAAP financial results should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to,\nfinancial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Included below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to the comparable GAAP financial measures.\nAbout Alphatec Holdings, Inc.\nATEC, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Alphatec Spine, Inc., EOS imaging S.A.S. and SafeOp Surgical, Inc., is a medical\ndevice company dedicated to revolutionizing the approach to spine surgery through clinical distinction.

Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are\nsubject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in\nthe forward-looking statements. The Company cautions investors that there can be no assurance that actual results will\nnot differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.\nForward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: references to the Company’s revenue, balance sheet, growth,\nand financial outlook and commitments; and the Company's ability to compel surgeon adoption, drive procedural growth\nand transform the sales channel. Important factors that could cause actual operating results to differ significantly from\nthose expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the uncertainty of success\nin developing new products or products currently in the pipeline; the uncertainties in the Company’s ability to execute\nupon its strategic operating plan; the uncertainties regarding the ability to successfully license or acquire new products,\nand the commercial success of such products; failure to achieve acceptance of the Company’s products by the surgeon\ncommunity; failure to obtain FDA or other regulatory clearance or approval or unexpected or prolonged delays in\nthe process; continuation of favorable Third-party reimbursement; unanticipated expenses or liabilities or other adverse\nevents affecting cash flow or the Company’s ability to achieve profitability; uncertainty of additional funding and the form\nof such funding; product liability exposure; an unsuccessful outcome in any litigation; patent infringement claims; claims\nrelated to the Company’s intellectual property; and the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations. A further list\nand description of these and other factors, risks and uncertainties can be found in the Company's most recent annual\nreport, and any subsequent quarterly and current reports, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ATEC\ndisclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new\ninformation, future events, or otherwise, unless required by law.\nNon-GAAP Definitions\nAmortization of intangible assets: Represents amortization expense associated with intangible assets including, but not\nlimited to customer relationships, intellectual property, and trade names acquired in business combinations and asset\nacquisitions.\nLitigation-related expenses: We are involved in various litigation matters that from time-to-time result in settlements.\nLitigation matters can vary in their characteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results and core business\noperations. We review litigation matters from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective to determine whether such\nmatters are a normal and recurring part of our business. We include in our GAAP financial statements litigation fees and\nsettlement expenses that we determine to be normal, recurring and routine to our business. When we determine that\ncertain litigation matters are not normal and recurring to our core business operations, we believe excluding these\nexpenses will provide our management and investors with useful incremental information. Litigation fees and settlement\nexpenses excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures in the periods presented relate primarily to patent litigation\nand other litigation matters that relate directly to the business transformation that we started in 2018 and are discussed\nmore fully in our periodic reports filed with the Securities Exchange Commission.\nOther non-recurring expenses: These expenses represent non-recurring expenses that we consider to be one-time in\nnature.\nPurchase accounting adjustments on acquisitions: Includes non-cash expenses incurred as a result of fair value asset step-\nups associated with tangible assets acquired from business combinations or asset acquisitions.\nRestructuring expenses: From time-to-time, in order to realign the Company’s operations or to achieve synergies\nassociated with an acquisition, the Company may eliminate roles or restructure its operations and footprint. In such cases\nthe Company may incur one-time severance and personnel costs associated with workforce reductions, or costs associated\n3\nwith exiting and/or relocating facilities. We exclude these costs as we do not consider such amounts to be part of the\nongoing operations.\nStock-based compensation: Stock-based compensation is charged to cost of revenue and operating expenses. We exclude\nstock-based compensation from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding these non-\ncash expenses provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. Because of the variety\nof equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining stock-based compensation expense, the\nsubjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market\nconditions outside the Company’s control, the Company believes excluding stock-based compensation expense enhances\nthe ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time.\nTransaction-related expenses: These expenses represent one-time costs associated with business combinations and asset\nacquisitions. These items may include but are not limited to consulting and legal fees, contract termination costs and other\nrelated deal costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Represents earnings before non-operating income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as\nadjusted for the applicable non-GAAP adjustments previously described.\nInvestor/Media Contact:\nTina Jacobsen, CFA\nInvestor Relations\n(760) 494-6790\ninvestorrelations@atecspine.com\nCompany Contact:\nJ.

(Nasdaq: ATEC), a provider of innovative solutions dedicated to\nrevolutionizing the approach to spine surgery, today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and recent\ncorporate highlights.\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nQuarter Ended\nJune 30, 2024\nTotal revenue $146 million\nGAAP gross margin 71%\nNon-GAAP gross margin 71%\nGAAP operating expenses $138 million\nNon-GAAP operating expenses $114 million\nGAAP net loss ($41) million\nAdjusted EBITDA $5.6 million\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 4%\nEnding cash balance $100 million\nRecent Highlights\n Launched EOS InsightTM, integrating the power of EOS imaging, automation and AI into spine operating rooms;\n Continued to elevate U.S. footprint with expansion in several major markets, which was reflected in a record 244 surgeon training\nengagements;\n Drove 20% growth in new surgeon adoption, a key leading indicator of long-term future growth;\n Deployed over $50 million of revenue-generating assets to capitalize on new surgeon adoption, U.S. footprint expansion and\nmarket disruption;\n Appointed Keith Valentine, spine veteran with over 30 years of direct spine industry experience, to the Board of Directors.\n“In the second quarter, ATEC’s procedural thesis perpetuated best-in-class top line growth and fueled the accomplishment of several\nmilestones,” said Pat Miles, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The launch of EOS Insight has begun, enabling the translation of\nEOS images into unparalleled informatics that advance every step of the clinical experience. Surgeon training reached an all-time high\nfueled by accelerated surgeon demand in new and existing territories. We also progressed toward self-funded growth, inflecting to\nprofitability. These are the expected results of a deliberate, spine-focused, long game, and testament that our best is yet to come.”\nFinancial Outlook for the Full-Year 2024\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the Company now expects total revenue to grow 25% to $602 million compared to the\nprevious expectation of $601 million. This includes surgical revenue of $537 million and EOS revenue of $65 million.

Access details will be shared via email.\nA replay of the webcast will remain available through the Investor Relations Section of ATEC’s Corporate Website for twelve months.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nTo supplement the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates of America (GAAP), the Company reports certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP\noperating expenses, non-GAAP operating loss, and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures provide investors with an additional tool for evaluating the Company's core performance, which management uses in its own\nevaluation of continuing operating performance, and a baseline for assessing the future earnings potential of the Company. The\nCompany’s non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies\nin the Company’s industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related\nto non-recurring, unusual items. Non-GAAP financial results should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior\nto, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Included below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to\nthe comparable GAAP financial measures.\nAbout Alphatec Holdings, Inc.\nATEC, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Alphatec Spine, Inc., EOS imaging S.A.S. and SafeOp Surgical, Inc., is a medical device\ncompany dedicated to revolutionizing the approach to spine surgery through clinical distinction. ATEC’s Organic Innovation MachineTM\nis focused on developing new approaches that integrate seamlessly with the Company’s expanding AlphaInformatiX Platform to better\ninform surgery and more safely and reproducibly achieve the goals of spine surgery. ATEC’s vision is to be the Standard Bearer in Spine.\nFor more information, visit us at www.atecspine.com.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that\ninvolve risks and uncertainty. Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to a number of risks\nand uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The Company\ncautions investors that there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such\nforward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: references to\nthe Company’s revenue, balance sheet, growth, and financial outlook and commitments; and the Company's ability to compel surgeon\nadoption and transform the sales channel. Important factors that could cause actual operating results to differ significantly from those\nexpressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the uncertainty of success in developing new\nproducts or products currently in the pipeline; the uncertainties in the Company’s ability to execute upon its strategic operating plan;\nthe uncertainties regarding the ability to successfully license or acquire new products, and the commercial success of such products;\nfailure to achieve acceptance of the Company’s products by the surgeon community; failure to obtain FDA or other regulatory clearance\nor approval or unexpected or prolonged delays in the process; continuation of favorable Third-party reimbursement; unanticipated\n2\nexpenses or liabilities or other adverse events affecting cash flow or the Company’s ability to achieve profitability; uncertainty of additional\nfunding; product liability exposure; an unsuccessful outcome in any litigation; patent infringement claims; claims related to the Company’s\nintellectual property; and the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations. A further list and description of these and other factors,\nrisks and uncertainties can be found in the Company's most recent annual report, and any subsequent quarterly and current reports, filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission. ATEC disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking\nstatements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by law.\nNon-GAAP Definitions\nAmortization of intangible assets: Represents amortization expense associated with intangible assets including, but not limited to\ncustomer relationships, intellectual property, and trade names acquired in business combinations and asset acquisitions.\nLitigation-related expenses: We are involved in various litigation matters that from time-to-time result in settlements. Litigation matters\ncan vary in their characteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results and core business operations. We review litigation\nmatters from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective to determine whether such matters are a normal and recurring part of our\nbusiness. We include in our GAAP financial statements litigation fees and settlement expenses that we determine to be normal, recurring\nand routine to our business. When we determine that certain litigation matters are not normal and recurring to our core business\noperations, we believe excluding these expenses will provide our management and investors with useful incremental information.\nLitigation fees and settlement expenses excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures in the periods presented relate primarily to\npatent litigation and other litigation matters that relate directly to the business transformation that we started in 2018 and are discussed\nmore fully in our periodic reports filed with the Securities Exchange Commission.\nOther non-recurring expenses: These expenses represent non-recurring expenses that we consider to be one-time in nature.\nPurchase accounting adjustments on acquisitions: Includes non-cash expenses incurred as a result of fair value asset step-ups\nassociated with tangible assets acquired from business combinations or asset acquisitions.\nRestructuring expenses: From time-to-time, in order to realign the Company’s operations or to achieve synergies associated with an\nacquisition, the Company may eliminate roles or restructure its operations and footprint. In such cases the Company may incur one-time\nseverance and personnel costs associated with workforce reductions, or costs associated with exiting and/or relocating facilities. We\nexclude these costs as we do not consider such amounts to be part of the ongoing operations.\nStock-based compensation: Stock-based compensation is charged to cost of revenue and operating expenses. We exclude stock-based\ncompensation from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding these non-cash expenses provides\nmeaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. Because of the variety of equity awards used by companies,\nthe varying methodologies for determining stock-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those\ndeterminations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the Company’s control, the Company\nbelieves excluding stock-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the\nunderlying performance of its business over time.\nTransaction-related expenses: These expenses represent one-time costs associated with business combinations and asset acquisitions.\nThese items may include but are not limited to consulting and legal fees, contract termination costs and other related deal costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Represents earnings before non-operating income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted for the\napplicable non-GAAP adjustments previously described.\nInvestor/Media Contact:\nTina Jacobsen, CFA\nInvestor Relations\n(760) 494-6790\ninvestorrelations@atecspine.com\n3\nCompany Contact:\nJ.

The\nCompany believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with an additional tool for evaluating the\nCompany's core performance, which management uses in its own evaluation of continuing operating performance, and a\nbaseline for assessing the future earnings potential of the Company. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may\nnot provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as\nother companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring,\nunusual items. Non-GAAP financial results should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to,\nfinancial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Included below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to the comparable GAAP financial measures.\nAbout Alphatec Holdings, Inc.\nATEC, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Alphatec Spine, Inc., EOS imaging S.A.S. and SafeOp Surgical, Inc., is a medical\ndevice company dedicated to revolutionizing the approach to spine surgery through clinical distinction. ATEC’s Organic\nInnovation MachineTM is focused on developing new approaches that integrate seamlessly with the Company’s expanding\nAlphaInformatiX Platform to better inform surgery and more safely and reproducibly achieve the goals of spine surgery.\nATEC’s vision is to be the Standard Bearer in Spine.

Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are\nsubject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in\nthe forward-looking statements. The Company cautions investors that there can be no assurance that actual results will\nnot differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.\nForward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: references to the Company’s revenue, balance sheet, growth,\nand financial outlook and commitments; and the Company's ability to compel surgeon adoption and transform the sales\nchannel. Important factors that could cause actual operating results to differ significantly from those expressed or implied\nby such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the uncertainty of success in developing new products\nor products currently in the pipeline; the uncertainties in the Company’s ability to execute upon its strategic operating\nplan; the uncertainties regarding the ability to successfully license or acquire new products, and the commercial success\nof such products; failure to achieve acceptance of the Company’s products by the surgeon community; failure to\n2\nobtain FDA or other regulatory clearance or approval or unexpected or prolonged delays in the process; continuation of\nfavorable Third-party reimbursement; unanticipated expenses or liabilities or other adverse events affecting cash flow or\nthe Company’s ability to achieve profitability; uncertainty of additional funding; product liability exposure; an unsuccessful\noutcome in any litigation; patent infringement claims; claims related to the Company’s intellectual property; and the\nCompany’s ability to meet its financial obligations. A further list and description of these and other factors, risks and\nuncertainties can be found in the Company's most recent annual report, and any subsequent quarterly and current\nreports, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ATEC disclaims any intention or obligation to update or\nrevise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless\nrequired by law.\nNon-GAAP Definitions\nAmortization of intangible assets: Represents amortization expense associated with intangible assets including, but not\nlimited to customer relationships, intellectual property, and trade names acquired in business combinations and asset\nacquisitions.\nLitigation-related expenses: We are involved in various litigation matters that from time-to-time result in settlements.\nLitigation matters can vary in their characteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results and core business\noperations. We review litigation matters from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective to determine whether such\nmatters are a normal and recurring part of our business. We include in our GAAP financial statements litigation fees and\nsettlement expenses that we determine to be normal, recurring and routine to our business. When we determine that\ncertain litigation matters are not normal and recurring to our core business operations, we believe excluding these\nexpenses will provide our management and investors with useful incremental information. Litigation fees and settlement\nexpenses excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures in the periods presented relate primarily to patent litigation\nand other litigation matters that relate directly to the business transformation that we started in 2018 and are discussed\nmore fully in our periodic reports filed with the Securities Exchange Commission.\nOther non-recurring expenses: These expenses represent non-recurring expenses that we consider to be one-time in\nnature.\nPurchase accounting adjustments on acquisitions: Includes non-cash expenses incurred as a result of fair value asset step-\nups associated with tangible assets acquired from business combinations or asset acquisitions.\nRestructuring expenses: From time-to-time, in order to realign the Company’s operations or to achieve synergies\nassociated with an acquisition, the Company may eliminate roles or restructure its operations and footprint. In such cases\nthe Company may incur one-time severance and personnel costs associated with workforce reductions, or costs associated\nwith exiting and/or relocating facilities. We exclude these costs as we do not consider such amounts to be part of the\nongoing operations.\nStock-based compensation: Stock-based compensation is charged to cost of revenue and operating expenses. We exclude\nstock-based compensation from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding these non-\ncash expenses provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. Because of the variety\nof equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining stock-based compensation expense, the\nsubjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market\nconditions outside the Company’s control, the Company believes excluding stock-based compensation expense enhances\nthe ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time.\n3\nTransaction-related expenses: These expenses represent one-time costs associated with business combinations and asset\nacquisitions. These items may include but are not limited to consulting and legal fees, contract termination costs and other\nrelated deal costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Represents earnings before non-operating income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as\nadjusted for the applicable non-GAAP adjustments previously described.\nInvestor/Media Contact:\nTina Jacobsen, CFA\nInvestor Relations\n(760) 494-6790\ninvestorrelations@atecspine.com\nCompany Contact:\nJ.

(Nasdaq: ATEC), a provider of innovative solutions dedicated to revolutionizing the approach to spine surgery, today announced financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and business highlights. \n\n**Fourth** **Quarter and Full Year 2023** **Financial** **Results**\n\nQuarter EndedDecember 31, 2023 | Year EndedDecember 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nTotal revenues |  $  |  138  |  $  |  482   \nGAAP gross margin |  69.0  |  %  |  64.3  |  %   \nNon-GAAP gross margin (prior definition)* |  72.9  |  %  |  72.6  |  %   \nNon-GAAP gross margin (updated definition)* |  69.7  |  %  |  69.8  |  %   \nOperating expenses |  $  |  140  |  $  |  484   \nNon-GAAP operating expenses |  $  |  106  |  $  |  387   \nGAAP net loss |  $  |  (49  |  )  |  $  |  (187  |  )   \nNon-Gaap adjusted EBITDA (prior definition)* |  $  |  6  |  $  |  4   \nNon-Gaap adjusted EBITDA (updated definition)* |  $  |  2  |  $  |  (9  |  )   \nEnding cash balance |  $  |  221   \n_*Refer to discussion of updated non-GAAP financial definition. Numbers and percentages may not foot due to rounding._  \n  \n**Business Highlights**\n\n  * Portfolio-wide strength drove fourth quarter 2023 surgical revenue growth of 34% with an acceleration in volume growth to 29% compared to 24% in the prior quarter; \n  * Expanded lateral platform with full launch of Lateral TransPsoas (LTP™) + Midline ALIF approaches and Calibrate LTX™, a lateral expandable implant; \n  * Elevated the procedural sophistication of comprehensive portfolio with launch of 15 new products and line extensions in 2023; \n  * Trained over 500 surgeons in 2023, contributing to a 27% increase in surgeon users compared to 2022. \n\n\n\nPat Miles, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"The success we’ve achieved to date is testament: ATEC lateral sophistication, alone, is capable of building a good, profitable company. But we aspire for much more. We are building a spine monster, and the informatics and procedural innovation that our 100% spine-focused knowhow will unleash in the years ahead will further our mission to truly revolutionize spine care. We are all systems go in the pursuit of ATEC’s best, which is yet to come.\" \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Definition Update**\n\nThe Company is updating its non-GAAP financial measures to include the non-cash impact of the provision for excess and obsolete inventory (“E&O”) in the calculation of Cost of Goods Sold. With the majority of ATEC’s strategic portfolio transformation complete, the Company has determined that E&O charges are a normal and recurring aspect of operating the business and should be included in the assessment of operating performance. For detail on the impact of this reporting change on previously reported periods and 2024 guidance, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures under both the updated and prior definitions has been included in this release and on the [Investor Relations Section](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.alphatecspine.com%2Fquarterly-results%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=53901767&newsitemid=20240227112817&lan=en-US&anchor=Investor+Relations+Section&index=1&md5=bc8cd3891fe2fac40b60c869201ccb58) of ATEC’s Corporate Website. \n\n**Financial Outlook** **for the Full Year 2024**\n\nThe Company continues to expect total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, to approximate $595 million, reflecting growth of approximately 23% compared to 2023. This includes surgical revenue of $530 million and approximately $65 million of EOS revenue. The Company expects full year 2024 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to approximate $22 million, which implies 560 basis points of improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to full year 2023. Under the prior non-GAAP financial definition, adjusted EBITDA guidance would have approximated $40 million. \n\n**Financial Results Webcast**\n\nThe Company will host a live webcast today at 1:30 p.m. PT / 4:30 p.m. ET. To access the live webcast, please visit the [Investor Relations Section](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.alphatecspine.com%2Fquarterly-results%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=53901767&newsitemid=20240227112817&lan=en-US&anchor=Investor+Relations+Section&index=2&md5=9d6d849f95eac15e381192b51f5714f1) of ATEC’s Corporate Website. \n\nTo dial into the live webcast, please register at [this link](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fconferencingportals.com%2Fevent%2FZFNDhzxx&esheet=53901767&newsitemid=20240227112817&lan=en-US&anchor=this+link&index=3&md5=ed44721dd2d37aefab53b7167a71c6b5).

The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with an additional tool for evaluating the Company's core performance, which management uses in its own evaluation of continuing operating performance, and a baseline for assessing the future earnings potential of the Company. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. Non-GAAP financial results should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Included below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures and a discussion of the Company’s non-GAAP definitions. We have not reconciled our adjusted operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA estimates for full year 2024 because certain items that impact these figures are uncertain or out of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of 2024 adjusted operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA estimates is not available without unreasonable effort. \n\n**Inducement Awards Granted**\n\nAs an inducement material to accepting employment with the Company, and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4), ATEC today announced that the independent Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has approved aggregate grants to 22 new employees (who are not executive officers) of, collectively, 31,780 restricted stock units (“RSUs”) under the Company’s 2016 Employment Inducement Award Plan. The RSUs will vest in equal annual installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date, provided that the recipient remains continuously employed by ATEC as of such vesting date. In addition, the RSUs will vest fully upon a change of control of ATEC. \n\n**About** **Alphatec Holdings, Inc.**\n\nATEC, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Alphatec Spine, Inc., EOS imaging S.A.S. and SafeOp Surgical, Inc., is a medical device company dedicated to revolutionizing the approach to spine surgery through clinical distinction. ATEC’s Organic Innovation Machine™ is focused on developing new approaches that integrate seamlessly with the Company’s expanding AlphaInformatiX Platform to better inform surgery and more safely and reproducibly achieve the goals of spine surgery.

The Company cautions investors that there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.

Important factors that could cause actual operating results to differ significantly from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the uncertainty of success in developing new products or products currently in the pipeline; the uncertainties in the Company’s ability to execute upon its strategic operating plan; the uncertainties regarding the ability to successfully license or acquire new products, and the commercial success of such products; failure to achieve acceptance of the Company’s products by the surgeon community; failure to obtain FDA or other regulatory clearance or approval or unexpected or prolonged delays in the process; continuation of favorable third-party reimbursement; unanticipated expenses or liabilities or other adverse events affecting cash flow or the Company’s ability to achieve profitability; uncertainty of additional funding; the Company’s ability to compete with other products or with emerging technologies; product liability exposure; an unsuccessful outcome in any litigation; patent infringement claims; claims related to the Company’s intellectual property; and the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations.

tax-planning strategy_  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Definitions**\n\n  * Amortization of intangible assets: Represents amortization expense in connection with business combinations or asset acquisitions associated with acquired intangible assets including, but not limited to customer relationships, intellectual property and trade names. \n  * Litigation-related expenses: We are involved in various litigation matters that from time-to-time result in settlements. Litigation matters can vary in their characteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results and core business operations. We review litigation matters from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective to determine whether such matters are a normal and recurring part of our business. We include in our GAAP financial statements litigation fees and settlement expenses that we determine to be normal, recurring and routine to our business. When we determine that certain litigation matters are not normal and recurring to our core business operations, we believe excluding these expenses will provide our management and investors with useful incremental information. Litigation fees and settlement expenses excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures in the periods presented relate primarily to patent litigation and other litigation matters that relate directly to the business transformation that we started in 2018 and are discussed more fully in our periodic reports filed with the Securities Exchange Commission. \n  * Other non-recurring expenses: These expenses represent non-recurring expenses that we consider to be one-time in nature. \n  * Purchase accounting adjustments on acquisitions: Includes non-cash expenses incurred as a result of fair value asset step-ups associated with tangible assets acquired from business combinations or asset acquisitions. \n  * Restructuring expenses: From time-to-time, in order to realign the Company’s operations or to achieve synergies associated with an acquisition, the Company may eliminate roles or restructure its operations and footprint. In such cases the Company may incur one-time severance and personnel costs associated with workforce reductions, or costs associated with exiting and/or relocating facilities. We exclude these costs as we do not consider such amounts to be part of the ongoing operations. \n  * Stock-based compensation: Stock-based compensation is charged to cost of revenue and operating expenses. We exclude stock-based compensation from certain of our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding these non-cash expenses provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. Because of the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining stock-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the Company’s control, the Company believes excluding stock-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time. \n  * Transaction-related expenses: These expenses represent one-time costs associated with business combinations and asset acquisitions. These items may include but are not limited to consulting and legal fees, contract termination costs and other related deal costs. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA: Represents earnings before non-operating income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted for the applicable non-GAAP adjustments previously described. \n\n\n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20240227112817r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Investor/Media Contact:** Tina Jacobsen, CFA Investor Relations (760) 494-6790 investorrelations@atecspine.com\n\n**Company Contact:** J.

          "content": "Data as of Q4 2023 earnings release on February 27, 2024. ATEC cautions you that statements included in this document that are not a description of historical facts are for ward-looking statements\nwithin the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainty. Such statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to a\nnumber of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The Company cautions investors that there\ncan be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Forward-looking statements include,\nbut are not limited to: references to the Company’s revenue and growth outlook; planned product launches, introductions, regulatory submissions or clearances; efforts to transform sales and\ndistribution channels; the Company’s ability to compel surgeon adoption; and the Company’s future ability to finance its operations and sufficiency of its cash runway. Important factors that could cause\nactual operating results to differ signifiantly from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the uncertainty of success in developing new products or\nproducts currently in the pipeline; the uncertainties in the Company’s ability to execute upon its strategic operating plan; the uncertainties regarding the ability to successfully license or acquire new\nproducts, and the commercial success of such products; failure to achieve acceptance of the Company’s products by the surgeon community; failure to obtain FDA or other regulatory clearance or\napproval or unexpected or prolonged delays in the process; continuation of favorable third party reimbursement; unanticipated expenses or liabilities or other adverse events affecting cash flow or the\nCompany’s ability to achieve profitability; uncertainty of additional funding; the Company’s ability to compete with other products or with emerging technologies; product liability exposure; an\nunsuccessful outcome in any litigation; patent infringement claims; claims related to the Company’s intellectual property; and the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations. A further list and\ndescription of these and other factors, risks and uncertainties can be found in the Company's most recent annual report, and any subsequent quarterly and current reports, led with the Securities and\nExchange Commission. ATEC disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required\nby law. This document contains information regarding the Company’s financial results that is calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). These non- GAAP financial measures are not measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP and may exclude items that are significant in\nunderstanding and assessing our financial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative or superior to GAAP measures. Be aware that our presentation of\nthese measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.\n1\n2\n3\n4\nNon-GAAP Measures, Adjustments and Definitions\nTo supplement the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of\nAmerica (GAAP), the Company reports certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-\nGAAP operating loss, and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures may include certain adjustments related to the following\nitems:\n•\nConstant currency revenue adjustments\n•\nAmortization of intangible assets\n•\nLitigation-related expenses\n•\nOther non-recurring expenses\n•\nPurchase accounting adjustments on acquisitions\n•\nRestructuring expenses\n•\nStock-based compensation\n•\nTransaction-related expenses\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with an additional tool for evaluating the Company's core\nperformance, which management uses in its own evaluation of continuing operating performance, and a baseline for assessing the future earnings\npotential of the Company. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by\nother companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly\nrelated to non-recurring, unusual items. Non-GAAP financial results should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to,\nfinancial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We have not reconciled our adjusted operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA estimates for\nfull year 2024 because certain items that impact these figures are uncertain or out of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a\nreconciliation of 2024 adjusted operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA estimates is not available without unreasonable effort.\nNon-GAAP Definitions\n§\nAmortization of intangible assets:\nRepresents amortization expense in connection with business combinations or asset acquisitions associated with acquired intangible\nassets including, but not limited to customer relationships, intellectual property and trade names.\n§\nLitigation-related expenses:\nWe are involved in various litigation matters that from time-to-time result in settlements. Litigation matters can vary in their\ncharacteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results and core business operations. We review litigation matters from both\na qualitative and quantitative perspective to determine whether such matters are a normal and recurring part of our business. We include\n5\nin our GAAP financial statements litigation fees and settlement expenses that we determine to be normal, recurring and routine to our\nbusiness. When we determine that certain litigation matters are not normal and recurring to our core business operations, we believe\nexcluding these expenses will provide our management and investors with useful incremental information. Litigation fees and settlement\nexpenses excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures in the periods presented relate primarily to patent litigation and other\nlitigation matters that relate directly to the business transformation that we started in 2018 and are discussed more fully in our periodic\nreports filed with the Securities Exchange Commission.\n§\nOther non-recurring expenses:\nThese expenses represent non-recurring expenses that we consider to be one-time in nature.\n§\nPurchase accounting adjustments on acquisitions:\nIncludes non-cash expenses incurred as a result of fair value asset step-ups associated with tangible assets acquired from business\ncombinations or asset acquisitions.\n§\nRestructuring expenses:\nFrom time-to-time, in order to realign the Company’s operations or to achieve synergies associated with an acquisition, the Company\nmay eliminate roles or restructure its operations and footprint. In such cases the Company may incur one-time severance and personnel\ncosts associated with workforce reductions, or costs associated with exiting and/or relocating facilities. We exclude these costs as we do\nnot consider such amounts to be part of the ongoing operations.\n§\nStock-based compensation:\nStock-based compensation is charged to cost of revenue and operating expenses. We exclude stock-based compensation from certain of\nour non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding these non-cash expenses provides meaningful supplemental\ninformation regarding operational performance. Because of the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies\nfor determining stock-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in\nvaluations that can be driven by market conditions outside the Company’s control, the Company believes excluding stock-based\ncompensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its\nbusiness over time.\n§\nTransaction-related expenses:\nThese expenses represent one-time costs associated with business combinations and asset acquisitions. These items may include but are\nnot limited to consulting and legal fees, contract termination costs and other related deal costs.\n§\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nRepresents earnings before non-operating income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted for the applicable non-\nGAAP adjustments previously described.\n6"

Business\nWe are a medical technology company, headquartered in Carlsbad, California, focused on the design, development, and advancement of technology for\nbetter surgical treatment of spine disorders. By applying our unique, 100% spine focus and deep, collective industry know-how, we aim to revolutionize the\napproach to spine surgery through clinical distinction. The sophisticated approaches that we create from the ground up integrate with our expanding Alpha\nInformatiX™ (\"AIX\") product platform to objectively inform surgery and achieve the goals of spine surgery more predictably and more reproducibly. We have a\ncomprehensive product portfolio designed to address the spine’s various pathologies, and are perpetually innovating to accomplish our ultimate vision, which is\nto be the standard bearer in spine.\nTotal revenue was $482.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of $131.4 million, or 37% compared to $350.9 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe our future success will continue to be fueled by increasing adoption of the new and existing integrated\ntechnologies that distinguish our approach-specific procedures. We feel that ATEC is well-positioned to continue to capitalize on spine market dynamics.\nBackground\nThe year 2018 marked the beginning of a business transformation that replaced 100% of our executive team, 92% of our Board of Directors, and 96% of\nthe remaining team with experienced professionals, infusing industry-leading spine know-how throughout our organization. Efforts that year founded the ATEC\nOrganic Innovation Machine™, in-house product design, development and testing capabilities that harnessed the team’s collective spine expertise to create\nclinical distinction.\nFrom 2019 through 2021, we focused on building a foundation capable of supporting the organization as we scale. We invested in new headquarters to\nsubstantially increase surgeon and sales training capacity and opened a distribution facility in Memphis, Tennessee, to ensure predictable and expedient surgical\nsupport as our footprint expands. We developed and released several key elements of our approach-based portfolio, including a comprehensive posterior fixation\nsystem and approach-specific IdentiTi™ porous titanium implants. We also acquired and integrated SafeOp™, technology that integrates uniquely with our\napproaches to provide information about both the location and the health of nerves intra-operatively. SafeOp became the informational foundation of the Prone\nTransPsoas (“PTP”) approach, which we developed and launched in 2020 to advance first-generation lateral spine surgery. We also acquired EOS®, technology\nthat enables full-body, calibrated, 3D images that integrate throughout the span of patient spine care to influence procedure planning and improve and quantify\nthe understanding of global alignment. As we execute our vision for EOS, we believe it will set new standards for spine care.\n2\nTable of Contents\nFrom 2022 to 2023, the momentum of PTP™ was robust, as both lateral-experienced and surgeons new to lateral surgery adopted the approach. We\napplied learnings from PTP to develop and introduce the Lateral TransPsoas (\"LTP\") and Midline ALIF approaches. Like PTP, the approaches were built from\nthe ground up and integrated with SafeOp, and are designed to enable single-position surgery for the most commonly treated levels in spine. We believe that our\nlateral franchise boasts unparalleled optionality, the capacity to address the clinical requirements for every pathology and surgeon preference regardless of\npatient position. The lateral sophistication that we have created is earning surgeons’ confidence and loyalty, and that is fueling portfolio-wide utilization of even\nour most conventional procedures.\nThe application of our team’s deep spine know-how, coupled with a willingness to invest holistically in each of the technologies integrated into all of\nATEC’s procedural approaches continues to increasingly compel surgeons and sales talent to partner with us. That adoption-driven validation has been the\nsource of industry-leading market share expansion, which has delivered an approximately 40% revenue compound annual growth rate since our transformation\ncommenced in 2018.\nRecent Developments\nPublic Offering\nOn October 27, 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering (the “Public Offering”) of 14,300,000 shares of our common stock at a price of\n$10.50 per share. In connection with the Public Offering, we granted the underwriters a 30-day option (the \"Green-Shoe\") to purchase additional shares of\ncommon stock in the offering at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The net proceeds from the Public Offering and Green-\nShoe, were approximately $145.8 million, including the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us. We expect to use the net\nproceeds from the Public Offering to fund general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or research and\ndevelopment.\nAsset Purchase Agreement\nOn April 19, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Integrity Implants Inc. and Fusion Robotics, LLC (collectively, the “Sellers”),\nwhereby we acquired certain assets, liabilities, employees, and contracts related to the Sellers’ navigation-enabled robotics platform (\"Valence\"). We paid the\nSellers cash consideration of $55.0 million for the purchase of Valence.\nUnderwritten Offering\nOn April 19, 2023, we completed a registered securities offering (the “Offering”) of 4,285,715 shares of our common stock at a price of $14.00 per\nshare. The net proceeds from the Offering were approximately $57.5 million, including the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid\nby us. We used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to fund the purchase of Valence. We expect to use the remaining proceeds to fund the costs related to\nthe post-closing integration and research and development activities related to Valence, as well as to fund general corporate purposes, including working capital,\ncapital expenditures, acquisitions, or research and development.\nTerm Loan\nOn January 6, 2023, we entered into a $150.0 million term loan credit facility with Braidwell Transaction Holdings, LLC (the “Braidwell Term Loan”).\nThe Braidwell Term Loan provided for an initial term loan of $100.0 million which was funded on the closing date. On September 28, 2023, we drew the\nadditional $50.0 million (the “delayed draw term loan(s)” or the “DDTL”). The Braidwell Term Loan matures on January 6, 2028. Borrowings under the\nBraidwell Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate for such SOFR business day (\"SOFR\") subject to a\n3% floor, plus 5.75%.\n3\nTable of Contents\nStrategy\nOur vision is to be the standard bearer in spine. By creating clinically distinct solutions that improve surgical outcomes, we believe that we are\npositioned to continue to earn share of the U.S. spine market, becoming the partner of choice for spine surgeons, hospitals, healthcare systems, and payors.\nTo achieve our vision and unlock long-term value, we have, and will continue to prioritize the following three key strategic initiatives:\n1. Create Clinical Distinction\nClinical distinction is paramount to our value creation strategy. We are committed to continuing to invest in the development, launch, and promotion of\napproaches and technologies intended to revolutionize spine surgery. We have developed, and continue to seek to develop, next-generation surgical approaches\nthat advance spine care with seamlessly integrated access systems, implants, positioners, biologics and enabling technologies, each specifically designed to\nbeget objective decision-making and to more successfully address the core spine pathologies.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we continued to champion adoption of our lateral franchise, including both PTP and LTP, and launched\nCalibrate LTX™, a lateral expandable interbody implant system. We also continued to foster development of Alpha InformatiX, a workflow-integrated\ninformatic ecosystem being designed to automatically and objectively inform spine patient care before, during and after surgery. A foundation of that ecosystem,\nthe EOS imaging system, drove revenue growth of over 20%, while significant progress was made on initiatives intended to materially advance the system’s\ncapabilities. We also acquired a robotic-enabled navigation system, branded \"Valence\", which is currently being developed to integrate into our lateral\nprocedural workflow.\nWith the expansion and increasing capabilities of our product portfolio, we continue to drive year-over-year growth in the number of product categories\nused per surgery, surgical volume, and average revenue per surgery. Aggregate product categories used per surgery expanded to 2.4 for the full-year 2023,\ncompared to 2.2 in the prior year. For the full year 2023, surgical volume grew 31% and average revenue per surgery expanded 7% compared to 2022.\nLooking to 2024 and beyond, we intend to continue to pioneer spine innovation that improves surgical outcomes. As such, we expect continued growth\nin the number of products sold into each surgery, surgical volume and revenue per surgery.\n2. Compel Surgeon Adoption\nAn integral part of our strategy is to compel surgeon adoption with the clinical distinction that we have, and will continue to introduce. Central to\ninspiring surgeon interest in our approaches is the “ATEC Experience,” an outcomes-based educational program for visiting surgeons facilitated at our\nheadquarters in Carlsbad, California. The program provides an interactive learning environment tailored to surgeon needs through both a peer-to-peer and\nsubject matter expert approach. We leverage our state-of-the-art, 7-station cadaveric lab to enable visiting surgeons to gain deep practical experience with our\nprocedural solutions and educate participants on our role in shaping innovation.\nThe surgeon relationships we are creating through that educational program continue to fuel strong growth. Over 500 new and existing surgeons\nparticipated in the ATEC Experience in 2023, driving 27% growth in our surgeon user base. Over time, we cultivate the relationships created, partnering with\neach surgeon in an increasing number of surgeries and fostering training to inspire partnership in increasingly complex surgeries. We seek to gradually expand\nutilization and position us well for sustained long-term growth.\n3. Elevate Distribution\nWe market and sell our products through a strategic network of independent sales agents and direct sales representatives. To deliver consistent,\npredictable growth, we have added, and intend to continue to add, clinically astute and exclusive independent sales agents and direct sales representatives to\nreach untapped surgeons, hospitals, and national accounts and better penetrate existing accounts and territories. We believe the opportunity to expand our\nstrategic sales network is vast, with approximately one third of U.S. territories, including many of the U.S.' most significant spine markets, still under- or\ncompletely unrepresented.\n4\nTable of Contents\nWith our acquisition of EOS, we aligned EOS’ U.S.-based capital sales team with our regional sales teams and leadership. The EOS sales team focuses\non hospital administrators, with the benefits of leads generated by our sales team and enhanced service support.\nIn 2023, we continued to enhance the expertise within our Memphis distribution facility. With expedient, flexible access to nearby distribution centers,\nwe believe the facility will foster centralized, predictable surgical support as we grow.\nWe are also in the nascent stages of building an international footprint. Beginning in 2022, we partnered with surgeons to treat our first patients in\nAustralia and New Zealand. Looking forward, we intend to focus our international investments in economically attractive markets with strong surgeon influence\nand reasonable regulatory pathways where we believe we can build a direct sales team that mirrors the sophistication of our U.S. network.\nSpine Anatomy\nThe spine is the core of the human skeleton, providing important structural support and alignment while remaining flexible to allow movement. A\ncolumn of 33 vertebrae, it protects the spinal cord and provides the main support for the body. Each bony segment of the spine is referred to as a vertebra (two\nor more are called vertebrae). The spine has five regions containing groups of similar bones, listed from top to bottom: seven cervical vertebrae in the neck,\ntwelve thoracic vertebrae in the mid-back (each attached to a rib), five lumbar vertebrae in the lower back, five sacral vertebrae fused together to form one bone\ncalled the sacrum, which sits in the pelvis, and four coccygeal bones fused together that form the tailbone. At the front of each vertebra is a block of bone called\nthe vertebral body. Vertebrae are stacked on top of each other and separated from each other through a cushioning intervertebral disc in the front, and bony\njoints in the back, which create the stability and mobility needed for sitting, standing, and walking. Strong muscles and bones, flexible tendons and ligaments,\nand sensitive nerves contribute to a healthy spine.\nPain can be caused when any of the spine’s structures is affected by strain, injury, or disease, and spine surgery seeks to alleviate that pain. While the\nspine has been surgically intervened upon for decades, research demonstrates that surgical outcomes in spine are generally inferior to surgical outcomes\ndelivered by most other orthopedic specialties, particularly in terms of durability, predictability and reproducibility. ATEC’s procedural offerings are designed to\ntreat the various spine pathologies by better achieving the three goals of surgery including: (1) decompression, (2) stabilization, and (3) alignment. We believe\nthere is vast opportunity to create value by innovating to improve surgical outcomes in spine.\nThe Alphatec Solution\nOur mission to improve outcomes by revolutionizing spine surgery affords a differentiated procedural investment thesis. Unlike most of our peers, we\ntake a holistic approach to the approaches that we bring to market, investing not just in the highest dollar components of the approach, but in each of the\ntechnologies that integrate to enhance the clinical predictability and reproducibility of an approach. Our procedures seamlessly incorporate technology\nengendered by that thesis, including an expanding informatic ecosystem designed to automatically and objectively inform spine patient care before, during and\nafter surgery, as well as approach-specific, ergonomic patient positioning and surgical access technology.\nOur principal offerings include comprehensive approaches designed and developed to specifically meet the requirements of the various spine approaches\nthat treat conditions ranging from degenerative disc disease to complex deformity and trauma. Depending on the approach, our solutions may comprise pre-,\nintra-, and post-operative information, positioners, access systems, interbody implants, fixation systems, and various biologics offerings; all designed to more\nreproducibly and predictably improve patient outcomes.\nOur flagship approach, PTP, was designed and released in 2020 by the team that created the first-generation lateral approach for spinal fusion to directly\naddress the known challenges that limited earlier adoption of the technique. Engineered to leverage the benefits achieved by lateral spinal fusion procedures,\nsuch as reduced blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and quicker recovery times, PTP safely treats a wide range of patient pathologies.\n5\nTable of Contents\nCompared to a standard lateral procedure, the PTP approach positions the patient in a prone (face down) position, allowing simultaneous access to the\nspine laterally (from the side) and posteriorly (from the back), all while in a position that is more familiar to surgeons and offering a more streamlined, more\northogonal approach. Single-position lateral surgery in the prone position minimizes unnecessary patient repositioning, enhances time efficiencies, provides\nsurgeons with increased optionality, and achieves spinal alignment objectives more reproducibly.\nThe PTP approach is enabled through a combination of purposefully developed technologies that address the unique challenges of approaching the spine\nlaterally while prone. One such challenge, and probably the greatest limit to earlier adoption of lateral approaches overall, is the need to safely and predictably\nnavigate across the lumbar plexus, an essential collection of nerves, to access the lumbar spine during surgery. Key to our PTP approach is the integration of\nSafeOp Advanced Neuromonitoring, a proprietary technology that couples automated electromyographic (“EMG”) and somatosensory evoked potential\n(“SSEP”) monitoring. SafeOp technology, as a result, is designed to uniquely beget real-time, surgeon-directed intra-operative information about both the\nlocation and the health of the patient’s nerves, enhancing the predictability and reproducibility of lateral approach outcomes.\nOur Technology\nAlpha InformatiX\nDesigned to provide actionable information that controls clinical variables in spine care, our AIX™ product platform comprises our EOS imaging system\nand VEA™ alignment mobile application, our SafeOp Neural InformatiX System and Valence. While some AIX applications are commercially available,\nsignificant development is underway to integrate and interconnect these technologies and bring unprecedented functionalities to market in 2024 and beyond.\nOur EOS imaging system is designed to provide unbiased, high-quality, and calibrated full-body imaging that enables a 3D model of patients’ skeletal\nsystems and to provide valuable diagnostic and surgical planning capabilities. The integration of our approach-specific solutions into EOS’ 3D surgical planning\nplatform is expected to better inform surgery and enhance the predictability of outcomes. Development is expected to allow surgeons to more effectively and\nefficiently assess patients’ full-body alignment, assess level-specific bone quality, establish surgical objectives, bend patient-specific rods pre-operatively,\nreconcile to surgical objectives intra-operatively, and determine whether surgical objectives were met post-operatively. Ultimately, we believe the standardized\nimages uniquely made possible by EOS pre-, intra-, and post-operatively can be the foundation for predictive care in spine.\nOur SafeOp Neural InformatiX System was the first advanced technology to launch from the AIX product platform. SafeOp is a patented technology that\nautomates both EMG and SSEP monitoring. As a result, the system can provide surgeons with objective, real-time, and actionable information about both nerve\nlocation and nerve health intra-operatively on a small, easy-to-use tablet platform. Integration of the information with our advanced access, implant, and fixation\ntechnologies equips surgeons with procedural solutions designed to enhance safety, efficiency, and reproducibility. The VEA mobile alignment application is\ndesigned to leverage EOS technology to more quickly quantify alignment parameters on a mobile device. Further development is aimed at enabling broad EOS\nimage access for the integration of intraoperative solutions.\n6\nTable of Contents\nValence was acquired in 2023. An intra-operative system developed by spine experts with deep navigation and robotics know-how, Valence integrates\nnavigation and robotics into spine procedures utilizing either a 3D imaging scan or 2D fluoroscopic images of the patient. Utilizing a small, table-mounted\nnavigation system, a robotic arm guides instrumentation and implants to a pre-determined destination during surgery. While we achieved regulatory clearance to\nplace Invictus® screws through the system late in 2023, we are seeking to further develop and commercialize our vision for Valence, which we expect to\nintegrate the navigation and robotics into our lateral procedures to improve surgical predictability, reduce radiation exposure, and enhance intra-operative\nprecision.\nPositioners\nWe have developed approach-specific patient positioning systems that integrate with our other access systems, providing for a more rigid construct and\nenhanced reproducibility. The PTP Patient Positioning System™, for example, was developed specifically for the PTP procedure as an adjunct to the Sigma™-\nPTP Access System. Designed to maximize the positional effects of having the patient in a prone position while streamlining operating room setup, PTP enables\na single-position surgery. Key features include bi-lateral structural support to minimize patient movement, adjustable side paddle position to accommodate\nvarying patient habitus, an integrated bed-rail system and compatibility with the Jackson frame. In addition, the system’s ultra-radiolucent carbon fiber frame is\ndesigned to help enhance fluoroscopic visibility and its coronal bending mechanism is designed to create reproducible access to L4-5 and upper lumbar regions.\nAccess Systems\nWe have differentiated surgical access instruments that are designed to maximize patient outcomes through enhanced visibility and rigidity, intuitive\northogonality, and approach-specific exposure. We offer several split-blade retractors which allow for direct, illuminated visualization and freedom of\nmaneuverability within the operative corridor. Our retractors also provide for stable positioning by attaching directly to the surgical table. We also offer\nprocedure-specific access systems, including our Sigma-ALIF Access System which allows for custom anterior abdominal exposure through freehand\nplacement of dissecting blades and connection to a ringed frame. The Sigma-ALIF Access System provides an unobstructed working corridor with custom\nfeatures to enable an ALIF approach in either supine or lateral decubitus.\nImplants and Fixation Systems\nOur portfolio of specialized spinal implants and fixation systems are designed to specifically meet the requirements of each approach. Available in\nvarying shapes, sizes, and lordosis options, our spinal implants include implants made from allograft, PEEK, and porous titanium. We offer NanoTec™ surface\nmodifications to our interbody systems to increase the surface area for cell adhesion and proliferation. Customization can be enhanced with our lordotic\nexpandable intervertebral body fusion system, Calibrate™ PSX, which was released in 2022. We also offer several standalone implants designed to provide for\nheight restoration and stabilization in one integrated solution.\nInvictus is our next-generation comprehensive spinal fixation solution, designed to treat the range of pathologies, with intraoperative adaptability and\nsurgical predictability through an open, minimally invasive, or hybrid approach. The sophistication of the Invictus Posterior Fixation System continues to\nexpand. The commercial release of Invictus OCT in early 2021 extended the system’s proficiencies to include the occiput and cervical spine, creating a single\nsystem capable of addressing the entire spine from occiput to ilium with familiar and consistent instrument design, simplified screw insertion, and intraoperative\nadaptability. The launch of Invictus OsseoScrew® later in 2021 advanced the system with the first and only expandable screw commercially available in the\nU.S. OsseoScrew has been designed to optimize fixation and address fixation failure in compromised bone.\n7\nTable of Contents\nBiologics\nWe have a variety of biologics designed to facilitate the process of spinal fusion. Our biologics offerings consist of several allograft (donated human\ntissue) options, including 3D ProFuse™ Osteoconductive Bioscaffold, and a family of AlphaGRAFT® products. 3D ProFuse Osteoconductive Bioscaffold is\nhighly compressible when hydrated, allowing for ease of handling and better endplate-to-endplate contact. Our AlphaGRAFT Demineralized Bone Matrix\n(“DBM”) consists of demineralized human tissue that is available in gel, putty, and fiber forms. AlphaGRAFT DBM Fibers combine the regenerative capacity\nof interconnected fibers with the maximum availability of growth factors endogenous to bone. Composed of 100% demineralized fibers, AlphaGRAFT DBM\nFibers offer moldable, cohesive handling characteristics. AlphaGRAFT Cellular Bone Matrix (“CBM”) is a growth factor-enriched cellular bone matrix that\nexhibits the angiogenic, osteoinductive, and mitogenic growth factors necessary for bone growth. AlphaGRAFT CBM may be delivered in granular, fiber, or\nstructural form. We also offer BioCORE™ Moldable Bioactive Graft which is a synthetic mineral-collagen composite matrix that can be molded to fit the bone\ndefect. Our Amnioshield® Amniotic Tissue Barrier is an allograft for spinal surgical barrier applications. The composite amniotic membrane is intended to act as\na biological barrier and provide an excellent dissection plane.\nProducts and Technologies Under Development\nInternally Developed Products and Technologies\nWe are expanding our portfolio of products and technologies to enhance clinical outcomes across multiple pathologies, regardless of a surgeon’s\npreferred surgical approach. We expect to launch 8-10 new products during 2024.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development team seeks to better meet the requirements of each surgical approach and design and release new products that increase\nour penetration of the U.S. spine market. We are focused on developing technology platforms and products that span the largest market segments addressing\ndegenerative and deformity spine pathologies. We have transformed our development process by focusing our programs and leveraging integrated teams to\nreduce the time frame from product concept to market commercialization. We also collaborate with surgeon partners to design products that are intended to\nenhance the clinical experience, simplify surgical techniques, and reduce overall costs, while improving patient outcomes. Most of our product development\nefforts are fully integrated in a singular location, our Carlsbad headquarters, which allows us to bring products from concept to market rapidly responding to\nsurgeon and patient needs. Our resources include a technology advancement cell for rapid prototyping, a cadaveric lab, and mechanical testing laboratory.\nSales and Marketing\nWe market and sell our products through a sales force consisting of dedicated and non-dedicated independent sales agents and dedicated employee direct\nsales representatives. We employ a team of area vice presidents, sales directors, and regional business managers, who are responsible for overseeing the sales\nchannel process in their territories. Although surgeons in the U.S. typically make the ultimate decision to use our products, we generally invoice the hospital for\nthe products that are used and pay commissions to the sales representative, or the sales agent based on payment received from the hospital. We compensate our\ndirect sales employees through salaries and incentive bonuses based on performance measures.\nWe evaluate and select our independent sales agent partners and sales employees based upon their expertise in selling spinal devices, reputation within\nthe surgeon community, geographical coverage, and established sales network.\nWe market our products at various industry conferences, organized surgical training courses, and in industry trade journals and periodicals.\n8\nTable of Contents\nSurgeon Training and Education\nWe focus our surgeon training efforts on delivering critical technical skills needed to perform the entire spinal fusion procedure through a peer-to-peer\napproach for qualified surgeon customers. Well-timed surgeon education programs drive customer conversion and loyalty by focusing on delivering value\nthrough improved clinical outcomes. We devote significant resources to training and education and are committed to a culture of scientific excellence and\nethics.\nWe believe that one of the most effective ways to introduce and build market demand for our products is by training and educating spine surgeons,\nindependent sales agents, and direct sales representatives on the benefits and use of our products. Sales training programs are a platform for learning and\norganizational development, ensuring the sales force is clinically competitive and considered an essential resource to all stakeholders. We focus on cross-\nfunctional collaboration and alignment to deliver timely and relevant programs to meet surgeon and representative needs and positively impact the business.\nOur training and education programs are designed to support new product introductions to the market as well as ongoing portfolio advancement. Our\nresources are nimble and responsive and include field-based engagements to supplement our core curriculum. We believe this is an effective way to increase\noverall surgeon adoption of our new products.\nWe believe that surgeons, independent sales agents, and direct sales representatives will become exposed to the merits and distinguishing features of our\nproducts through our training and education programs, and that such exposure will increase the use and promotion of our products. With a focus on the entire\nprocedure, we expect to build awareness of the breadth of our product offering. We are conscientious in the pursuit of delivering value to all stakeholders. Our\ngoal is to provide surgeon education programs, coupled with a growing and comprehensive sales training platform that create a sustainable competitive\nadvantage for our organization.\nManufacture and Supply\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for the manufacture of all our implants and instruments. Outsourcing implant manufacturing reduces our need for capital\ninvestment and reduces operational expense. Additionally, outsourcing provides expertise and capacity necessary to scale up or down based on demand for our\nproducts. We select our suppliers to ensure that all of our products are safe, effective, adhere to all applicable regulations, are of the highest quality, and meet\nour supply needs. We employ a rigorous supplier assessment, qualification, and selection process targeted to suppliers that meet the requirements of the FDA,\nand International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”), and quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures. Our quality assurance process\nmonitors and maintains supplier performance through qualification and periodic supplier reviews and audits.\nThe raw materials used in the manufacture of our non-biologic products are principally titanium, titanium alloys, stainless steel, cobalt chrome, ceramic,\nallograft, and PEEK. With the exception of PEEK, none of our raw material requirements is limited to any significant extent by critical supply. We are subject to\nthe risk that Invibio, one of a limited number of PEEK suppliers, will be unable to supply PEEK in adequate amounts and in a timely manner. We believe our\nsupplier relationships, alternative product offerings, vendor-managed inventory, and quality processes will support our potential capacity needs for the\nforeseeable future.\nWith respect to biologics products, we are FDA-registered and licensed in the states of California, New York, and Florida, the only states that currently\nrequire licenses. Our facility and the facilities of the third-party suppliers we use are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities and\nmay undergo compliance inspections conducted by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies. Because our biologics products are processed from\nhuman tissue, maintaining a steady supply can sometimes be challenging. We have not experienced significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials\nnecessary to fulfill our production requirements and we have not experienced a meaningful disruption to sales orders.\n9\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nAlthough we believe that our current broad product portfolio and development pipeline is differentiated and has numerous competitive advantages, the\nspinal implant industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change, and significantly affected by new product introductions. We believe that the\nprincipal competitive factors in our market include:\n• improved outcomes for spine pathology procedures;\n• ease of use, quality, and reliability of product portfolio;\n• effective and efficient sales, marketing, and distribution;\n• quality service and an educated and knowledgeable sales network;\n• technical leadership and superiority;\n• surgeon services, such as training and education;\n• responsiveness to the needs of surgeons;\n• acceptance by spine surgeons;\n• product price and qualification for reimbursement; and\n• speed to market.\nBoth our currently marketed products and any future products we commercialize are subject to intense competition. We believe that our most significant\ncompetitors are Medtronic (Sofamor Danek), Johnson & Johnson (DePuy Spine), Stryker, Zimmer Biomet, Globus Medical, and others, many of which have\nsubstantially greater financial resources than we do. In addition, these companies may have more established distribution networks, entrenched relationships\nwith physicians and greater experience in developing, launching, marketing, distributing, and selling spinal implant products.\nSome of our competitors also provide non-operative therapies for spine disorder conditions. While these non-operative treatments are considered to be\nan alternative to surgery, surgery is typically performed in the event that non-operative treatments are unsuccessful. We believe that, to date, these non-operative\ntreatments have not caused a material reduction in the demand for surgical treatment of spinal disorders.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements, proprietary\ninformation ownership agreements, and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights. We believe that in order to have a competitive advantage, we\nmust develop, maintain, and enforce the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We require our employees, consultants, co-developers, sales agents and\nadvisors to execute agreements governing the ownership of proprietary information and use and disclosure of confidential information in connection with their\nrelationship with us. In general, these agreements require these individuals and entities to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions that were conceived\non our behalf, or which relate to our property or business and to keep our confidential information confidential and only use such confidential information in\nconnection with our business.\nPatents. As of December 31, 2023, we and our affiliates owned, or we exclusively owned 156 issued U.S. patents, 42 pending U.S. patent applications\nand 257 issued or pending foreign patents. We own multiple patents relating to unique aspects and improvements for several of our products. Patents for\nindividual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is issued. We\ndo not believe that the expiration of any single patent is likely to significantly affect our intellectual property position.\nTrademarks. As of December 31, 2023, we and our affiliates owned 30 registered U.S. trademarks and 26 registered trademarks outside of the U.S.\n10\nTable of Contents\nGovernment Regulation\nOur products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other U.S. federal and state regulatory bodies and comparable authorities in other\ncountries. Our products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and in the case of our tissue products, also under\nthe Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”). To ensure that our products are safe and effective for their intended use, the FDA regulates, among other things, the\nfollowing activities that we or our partners perform and will continue to perform:\n• product design and development;\n• product testing;\n• non-clinical and clinical research;\n• product manufacturing;\n• product labeling;\n• product storage;\n• premarket clearance or approval;\n• advertising and promotion;\n• product marketing, sales and distribution;\n• import and export; and\n• post-market surveillance, including reporting deaths or serious injuries related to products and certain product malfunctions.\nGovernment Regulation—Medical Devices\nFDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the\nU.S. will require either FDA clearance of a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also\nreferred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to\nobtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Under the FDCA, medical\ndevices are classified into one of three classes - Class I, Class II or Class III - depending on the degree of risk associated with the use of the device and the\nextent of manufacturer and regulatory controls deemed to be necessary by the FDA to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness.\nClass I devices are those with the lowest risk to the patient for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of\nregulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), facility\nregistration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials.\nSome Class I devices also require 510(k) clearance by the FDA, though most Class I devices are exempt from the premarket notification requirements. Class II\ndevices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, product-specific guidance\ndocuments and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section\n510(k) of the FDCA. Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or\nimplantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices\ncannot be reasonably assured solely by compliance with the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices must be the\nsubject of an approved PMA. Both 510(k)s and PMAs are subject to the payment of user fees at the time of submission for FDA review.\n11\nTable of Contents\nIf the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device following submission and review of a 510(k) premarket\nnotification, or if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low\nrisk, the device sponsor may either pursue a PMA or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. Our current products on the market in the\nU.S. include Class II spinal implants, instruments, neuromonitoring systems, robotic navigation systems, x-ray imaging systems and software as a medical\ndevice (SaMD) marketed under 510(k) premarket clearance, as well as Class I 510(k) exempt spinal instruments and devices.\n510(k) Clearance Pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially\nequivalent to a device legally marketed in the U.S. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that\nwas legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to\nClass II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the\nsame intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological\ncharacteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial\nequivalence.\nThe FDA’s goal is to review and act on each 510(k) within 90 days of submission, but on average the process usually takes approximately six months. It\nmay take less time depending on the type of device and it may take longer if the FDA requests additional information. Most 510(k)s do not require supporting\ndata from clinical trials, but the FDA may request such data. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially\nmarket the device.\nAfter a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or\nmajor change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, require premarket approval. The FDA requires each\nmanufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires the submission of a 510(k) or PMA, but the FDA can review any such decision and can\ndisagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease\nmarketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA for any\nmodifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval.\nAlso, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant fines or penalties. We have made and plan to continue to make enhancements to our products for\nwhich we have not submitted 510(k)s or PMAs, and we will consider on a case-by-case basis whether a new 510(k) or PMA is necessary.\nThe FDA began to consider proposals to reform its 510(k) marketing clearance process in 2011, and such proposals could include increased requirements\nfor clinical data and a longer review period. Specifically, in response to industry and healthcare provider concerns regarding the predictability, consistency and\nrigor of the 510(k) regulatory pathway, the FDA initiated an evaluation of the 510(k) program, and as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and\nInnovation Act, Congress reauthorized the Medical Device User Fee Amendments with various FDA performance goal commitments and enacted several\n“Medical Device Regulatory Improvements” and miscellaneous reforms, which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre-\nand post-clearance and approval. Further, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”) was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things,\nis intended to modernize the regulation of devices and spur innovation but its ultimate implementation is unclear.\n12\nTable of Contents\nPremarket Approval Pathway. Class III devices require PMA before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the\nFDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is generally more complex, costly and time consuming than the\n510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and\ndevelopment, preclinical and clinical trials, manufacturing, and labeling information to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the\ndevice for its intended use. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction reasonable assurance of the\nsafety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to\npermit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of the PMA, although in\npractice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional\ninformation or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s\nresponse to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to\nreview and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s\nrecommendation. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with QSR. The PMA process\ncan be expensive, uncertain, and lengthy, and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by\nthe FDA for marketing.\nClinical Trials. Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for a 510(k). All clinical investigations of\ninvestigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”),\nregulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting, and\nmonitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device is determined to present a “significant risk” to human health, the\nmanufacturer may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an IDE application to the FDA and obtains approval of the IDE from the FDA. The IDE must be\nsupported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is\nscientifically sound. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), for each clinical\nsite. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE\napplication is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number\nof patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for\nthe trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the\ninvestigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. A clinical trial may be suspended by FDA,\nthe sponsor, or an IRB at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the trial.\nEven if a clinical trial is completed, the results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a device to the satisfaction of the FDA or may be equivocal or\notherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of a device. We are not currently undertaking any FDA IDE trials, as all of our existing products are FDA-cleared\nthrough the 510(k) pathway. It is possible, however, that future device development may require IDE clinical trial for approval.\nPervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation. After a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply.\nThese include:\n• registration and listing requirements, which require manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into\ncommercial distribution;\n• the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party contract manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control,\nsupplier/contractor selection, documentation, record maintenance and other quality assurance controls, during all aspects of the manufacturing\nprocess and to maintain and investigate complaints;\n• labeling regulations and unique device identification requirements;\n• advertising and promotion requirements;\n• restrictions on sale, distribution, or use of a device;\n13\nTable of Contents\n• FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved (“off-label”) uses;\n• medical device reporting obligations, which require that manufacturers submit reports to the FDA of device may have caused or contributed to a\ndeath or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur;\n• medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product\nrecalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to\nhealth;\n• device tracking requirements; and\n• other post-market surveillance requirements, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and\neffectiveness data for the device.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following:\n• warning letters and untitled letters;\n• fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties;\n• recalls, withdrawals, administrative detention, or seizure of products;\n• operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production;\n• withdrawals of 510(k) clearances or PMAs that have already been granted;\n• refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMAs of new products; and/or\n• criminal prosecution.\nOur facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to evaluate compliance\nwith applicable regulatory requirements.\nRegulation of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-based Products. Certain products are regulated as human cells, tissues, and cellular and\ntissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”). Section 361 of the PHSA authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of\ncommunicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as “361” HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA,\nscreening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, or Good Tissue Practice, when processing, storing, labeling, and distributing HCT/Ps, including required\nlabeling information, stringent record keeping, and adverse event reporting, among other applicable requirements and laws. If the HCT/P is minimally\nmanipulated, is intended for homologous use only and meets other requirements, the HCT/P will not require 510(k) clearance, PMA, a Biologics License\nApplication, or other premarket authorization from the FDA before marketing.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur facilities and operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations.\nThese laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions; wastewater discharges; the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of\nhazardous materials; the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes; the cleanup of contamination; and the health and safety of our employees. Under such laws\nand regulations, we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for some of our operations. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws,\nregulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We could also be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any\ncontamination at our past or present facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting\nfrom hazardous materials, and we may incur material liability as a result of any contamination or injury.\n14\nTable of Contents\nCompliance with Certain Applicable Statutes\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, criminal health\ncare fraud laws, physician payment transparency laws, data privacy and security laws, and foreign corrupt practice laws. Violations of these laws are punishable\nby criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government healthcare\nprograms, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws are administered by, among others, the U.S. Department of\nJustice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and state attorneys general. Many of these agencies have increased\ntheir enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or\nindirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service, for which\npayment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad\nand prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. For example, the definition of “remuneration”\nhas been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of\ncash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. In addition, among other things, the Patient Protection\nand Affordable Health Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as “ACA”), amended the intent\nrequirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Pursuant to the ACA, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the Anti-Kickback\nStatute or specific intent to violate it. Furthermore, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a\nviolation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.\nIn implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), has issued a series of\nregulations, known as the safe harbors, which began in July 1991. These safe harbors set forth provisions that, in circumstances where all the applicable\nrequirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a\ntransaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued.\nHowever, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by\ngovernment enforcement authorities such as the OIG. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as\nfines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have anti-kickback laws that are\nsimilar to the federal law, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, and may also result in\npenalties, fines, sanctions for violations, and exclusions from state or commercial programs.\nWe have entered into various agreements with certain surgeons that perform services for us, including some who make clinical decisions to use our\nproducts. Some of our referring surgeons own our stock, which they may have received from us as consideration for services performed. We frequently review\nthese arrangements to determine whether they are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, physician-owned distribution companies\n(“PODs”) have become decreasingly involved in the sale and distribution of medical devices, including products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders. In\nmany cases, these distribution companies enter into arrangements with hospitals that bill Medicare or Medicaid for the furnishing of medical services, and the\nphysician-owners are among the physicians who refer patients to the hospitals for surgery. On March 26, 2013, the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert entitled\n“Physician-Owned Entities, in which the OIG concluded, among other things, that PODs are “inherently suspect under the anti-kickback statute” and that PODs\npresent “substantial fraud and abuse risk and pose dangers of patient safety.” Since 2013, the OIG has further increased its scrutiny of PODs and the Department\nof Justice has brought several high-profile cases against physician owners.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false\nstatements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Private suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought by\nindividuals on behalf of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as “relators” or, more commonly, as “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts\npaid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing more\nhealthcare companies to have to defend a False Claim Act action. If an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to\npay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $13,964 and $27,894 for each separate false claim and\nmay be subject to exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. Various states have also enacted similar laws modeled after the\nfederal False Claims Act which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the\npayor.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to\nhealthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including\nprivate payors. The ACA changed the intent requirement of the healthcare fraud statute to such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge\nof this statute or specific intent to violate it. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or possible exclusion from Medicare,\nMedicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material\nfact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. A\nviolation of this statute is a felony and may result in similar sanctions.\nACA also includes various provisions designed to significantly strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement in addition to those changes discussed above.\nAmong these additional provisions include increased funding for enforcement efforts and new “sunshine” provisions to require us to report and disclose to the\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), any payment or “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals. These\nsunshine provisions also require certain group purchasing organizations, including physician-owned distributors, to disclose physician ownership information to\nCMS. We and other device manufacturers are required to collect and annually report specific data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and\nteaching hospitals. There are various state laws and initiatives that require device manufacturers to disclose to the appropriate regulatory agency certain\npayments or other transfers of value made to physicians, and in certain cases prohibit some forms of these payments, with the risk of fines for any violation of\nsuch requirements.\nHIPAA also includes privacy and security provisions designed to regulate the use and disclosure of “protected health information” (“PHI”), which is\nhealth information that identifies a patient and that is held by a health care provider, a health plan or health care clearinghouse. We are not directly regulated by\nHIPAA, but our ability to access PHI for purposes such as marketing, product development, clinical research or other uses is controlled by HIPAA and\nrestrictions placed on health care providers and other covered entities. HIPAA was amended in 2009 by the Health Information Technology for Economic and\nClinical Health Act (“HITECH”) which strengthened the rule, increased penalties for violations, and added a requirement for the disclosure of breaches to\naffected individuals, the government, and in some cases the media. We must carefully structure any transaction involving PHI to avoid violation of HIPAA and\nHITECH requirements.\nAlmost all states have adopted data security laws protecting personal information including social security numbers, state issued identification numbers,\ncredit card or financial account information coupled with individuals’ names or initials. We must comply with all applicable state data security laws, even\nthough they vary extensively, and must ensure that any breaches or accidental disclosures of personal information are promptly reported to affected individuals\nand responsible government entities. We must also ensure that we maintain compliant, written information security programs or run the risk of civil or even\ncriminal sanctions for non-compliance as well as reputational harm for publicly reported breaches or violations.\nIf any of our operations are found to have violated or be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and\nabuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, among them being civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs,\nand the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\n16\nTable of Contents\nThird-Party Reimbursement\nIn the U.S., healthcare providers generally rely on third-party payors, principally private insurers, and governmental payors such as Medicare and\nMedicaid, to cover and pay for all or part of the cost of a spine surgery in which our medical devices are used. We expect that sales volumes and prices of our\nproducts will depend in large part on the continued availability of reimbursement from such third-party payors. These third-party payors may deny\nreimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not medically necessary in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as\ndetermined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Particularly in the U.S., third-party payors continue to carefully review, and\nincreasingly challenge, the prices charged for procedures and medical products. Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies are developed by CMS, the\nfederal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, and its contractors. CMS establishes these Medicare policies for medical products and\nprocedures and such policies are periodically reviewed and updated. While private payors vary in their coverage and payment policies, the Medicare program is\nviewed as a benchmark. Medicare payment rates for the same or similar procedures vary due to geographic location, nature of the facility in which the\nprocedure is performed (i.e., teaching or community hospital) and other factors. We cannot provide assurance that government or private third-party payors will\ncover and provide adequate payment for the procedures in which our products are used. ACA and other reform proposals contain significant changes regarding\nMedicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of\n2011, which resulted in reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect\nthrough 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken, as well as, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced\nMedicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals and imaging centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to\nrecover overpayments to providers from three to five years. An expansion in government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may lower reimbursements for\nprocedures using our products, reduce medical procedure volumes, and adversely affect our business and results of operations, possibly materially.\nWe believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare\nindustry to reduce the costs of products and services. We cannot assure that government or private third-party payors will cover and provide adequate payment\nfor the procedures using our products. In addition, it is possible that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will adversely\naffect the demand for procedures using our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party\npayor coverage or reimbursement could have a significant adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 839 employees worldwide. Approximately 675 employees were located in the U.S. and 164 employees were located\noutside of the U.S. Of our U.S. employees, 428 were based in our Carlsbad, California headquarters, covering all of the following functional areas: sales,\ncustomer service, marketing, clinical education, advanced manufacturing, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, research and development, human resources,\nfinance, legal, information technology, and administration.\nOur workforce is highly educated and diverse, which we believe is important for our continued success as a leading innovator in the medical device\nmarket. We employ a number of strategies to best enable us to attract, retain, and engage our team members. To build a steady and diverse pipeline of talent, we\nhave a robust recruiting program, which is focused on attracting and retaining the talent we believe is necessary to help achieve our strategy and mission.\nFurther, we employ recruiting processes that mitigate unconscious biases and promote diverse candidate pools. Our employee base is comprised of men,\nwomen, underrepresented individuals, individuals with disabilities, and protected veterans.\n17\nTable of Contents\nTo attract and retain employees, we offer competitive, performance-based compensation and benefits, opportunities for discounted equity ownership,\nemployee recognition programs, career development opportunities, and access to continual growth through in-house live trainings, as well as support and\nreimbursement for external trainings and educational programs. In addition, to further expand employee enrichment and engagement, we periodically survey\nour employees regarding their satisfaction levels. We use these survey results to determine how we can continue to create work environments that energize our\nemployees and enable them to develop and maintain a positive working culture. We completed a survey in December 2023, in which over 88% of respondents\nindicated a willingness to recommend the Company to friends and family as a desirable place to work. High employee satisfaction is also reflected in our high\nemployee engagement and low undesired turnover, which was approximately 3.7% for 2023.\nWe have never experienced a work stoppage due to labor difficulties and believe that our relations with our employees are good. We currently have no\nemployees working under collective bargaining agreements.\nHealth and Wellness\nWe offer various health and wellness programs to promote a healthy and active lifestyle for our employees. In addition to our health and wellness\nprogram offerings, our corporate headquarters includes indoor and outdoor workout spaces, which our employees are able to access throughout the day, as well\nas various fitness and workout classes. We have provided health and wellness initiatives throughout the year to promote the continued wellbeing of our\nemployees, as well as opportunities for our employees to participate in community volunteer and clean-up programs to foster camaraderie within our employee\nbase.\nCorporate and Available Information\nWe are a Delaware corporation incorporated in March 2005. Our principal executive office is located at 1950 Camino Vida Roble, Carlsbad, California\n92008 and our telephone number is (760) 431-9286. Our Internet address is www.atecspine.com. We are not including the information contained on our website\nas a part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe file our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports,\nelectronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). We make these reports available to you free of charge through the Investor Relations\nsection of our website as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. The public can also\nobtain any documents that we file with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.\n18\nTable of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information\ncontained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks faced by the\nCompany. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial may become important factors that affect us. If any\nof such risks or the risks described below occur, either alone or taken together occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be\nmaterially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business plan relies on certain assumptions pertaining to the market for our products that, if incorrect, may adversely affect our growth and\nprofitability.\nWe allocate resources based on assumptions about trends in the development of and treatment for spine disorders and the resulting demand for our\nproducts. Our assumptions may not be accurate. Increasing awareness and use of non-invasive treatments and other shifts in technologies and treatments,\nemergence of new materials and acceptance of emerging technologies and procedures could adversely affect demand for our products. If our assumptions prove\nto be incorrect or if alternative treatments to those we offer gain further acceptance, then demand for our products could be significantly less than we anticipate\nand we may not be able to achieve or sustain growth or profitability.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market segment, face competition from large, well-established medical device companies with significant resources, and\nmay not be able to compete effectively.\nThe market in which we operate is highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change and affected by new products and market activities of\nindustry participants. Our competitors include numerous large and well-capitalized companies such as Medtronic Sofamor Danek, a subsidiary of Medtronic;\nDepuy Spine, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson; Stryker; Zimmer Biomet; and Globus Medical. Several of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages over\nus, including:\n• more established relationships with healthcare providers, distribution networks and healthcare payers;\n• broader product offerings and intellectual property portfolios, better name recognition, and more recognizable product trademarks;\n• greater resources for product research and development, clinical data, patent litigation, and launching, marketing, distributing and selling our\nproducts; and\n• greater experience in obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals for products and product enhancements.\nIn addition, at any time our current competitors or new industry participants may develop alternative treatments, products or procedures for the treatment\nof spine disorders that compete directly or indirectly with our products, including ones that may be superior to our spine surgery products. For these reasons, we\nmay not be able to compete successfully against our existing or potential competitors. Any such failure could lead us to further modify our strategy, lower our\nprices, increase our sales commissions and could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n19\nTable of Contents\nA significant percentage of our revenues are derived from sales of our systems that include polyaxial pedicle screws.\nNet sales of our systems that include polyaxial pedicle screws represented approximately 41% and 42% our net sales for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, and are expected to continue to be significant in the future. A decline in sales of these systems for any reason would have a\nsignificant adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We rely on third-party licenses related to our polyaxial pedicle screw\nsystems in order to use various proprietary technologies that are material to these systems, including the enforceability of the intellectual property rights in such\ntechnologies. Certain of our licenses may be terminated upon specific conditions. Our rights under each of the licenses are subject to our continued compliance\nwith the terms of the license, including certain diligence, disclosure and confidentiality obligations and the payment of royalties and other fees. Because of the\ncomplexity of our product and the patents we have licensed, determining the scope of the license and related obligations can be difficult and can lead to disputes\nbetween us and the licensor. An unfavorable resolution of such a dispute could lead to an increase in the royalties payable pursuant to the license or termination\nof the license. Any action that would prevent us from manufacturing, marketing and selling these systems or increase the costs associated with these systems\nwould have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reliance on sales agents could affect our ability to market our products efficiently and profitably.\nThe development of a large distribution network may be expensive and time consuming. Because of the intense competition for their services, we may\nbe unable to recruit or retain qualified independent sales agents. Like us, some of our competitors enter into exclusive distribution agreements. Further, we may\nnot be able to enter into agreements with independent sales agents on commercially reasonable terms. Even if we do enter into agreements with new\nindependent sales agents, it may take 90 to 120 days or even longer for new sales agents to reach full operational effectiveness. Some sales agents may not\ngenerate revenue as quickly as we expect, may not commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our products and may not ultimately be\nsuccessful in selling our products. Our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected if we do not attract and retain\nnew sales agents or if the marketing and sales efforts of our sales agents are unsuccessful.\nTo be commercially successful, we must convince the spine surgeon community that our products are an attractive alternative to competitive products.\nIn order for us to sell our products, spine surgeons must be convinced that our products are superior to competing products. Acceptance of our products\ndepends on educating the spine surgeon community as to the distinctive characteristics, perceived benefits, safety and cost-effectiveness of our products\ncompared to competitive products and on training spine surgeons in the proper application of our products. If we are not successful in convincing the spine\nsurgeon community of the merit of our products, our sales will decline, and we will be unable to increase or achieve and sustain growth or profitability.\nAdditionally, if surgeons are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products, which may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes,\npatient injury, negative publicity or lawsuits against us, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\n20\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply our products. Any problems experienced by these manufacturers could result in a\ndelay or interruption in the supply of our products until such manufacturer cures the problem or until we locate and qualify an alternative source of supply.\nWe rely on third party manufacturers of our implants, instruments, imaging equipment and spare parts. We currently rely on a limited number of third\nparties and any prolonged disruption in the operations of our third-party suppliers could have a negative impact on our ability to supply products to customers.\nWe may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed coverage under our manufacturer’s insurance policies. Other events beyond our control\ncould also disrupt our product development and commercialization efforts until such events can be resolved or we can put in place third-party contract\nmanufacturers to assume this manufacturing role. In addition, if we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the\nnew manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. Delays associated\nwith the verification of a new manufacturer or the re-verification of an existing manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop products or supply\nproducts to customers in a timely manner. Any disruption in the manufacture of our products by our third-party suppliers could have a material adverse impact\non our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers, and in one case a single supplier, for key raw materials and the loss of any of these third-party suppliers, or their\ninability to supply us with adequate raw materials, could harm our business.\nWe rely on a number of suppliers and in one case on a single source vendor, Invibio, to provide the raw materials used in the production of our products.\nWe have a supply agreement with Invibio, pursuant to which it supplies us with PEEK, a biocompatible plastic that we use in some of our spacers. Invibio is\none of a limited number of companies approved to distribute PEEK in the U.S. for use in implantable devices. We depend on a limited number of sources of\nhuman tissue for use in our biologics products. Our supply of human tissue from our current suppliers and our current inventory of biologics products may not\nbe available at current levels or may not be sufficient to meet our needs. Our dependence on a single third-party PEEK supplier and the challenges we may face\nin obtaining adequate supplies of biologics products involve several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and delivery schedules.\nAny supply interruption in a limited or sole sourced component or raw material could materially harm our ability to source manufactured products until a new\nsource of supply could be found. We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable\nterms, if at all, which would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations, the manufacture of our products could be delayed.\nWe and our suppliers are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies both inside and outside of the U.S. The FDA, and\nother regulatory agencies, audit compliance with some of these regulations. If significant non-compliance issues arise or if a corrective action plan is not\nsufficient, the manufacture or sale of our products may be limited until such problems are corrected to the regulatory body’s satisfaction, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our products could be subject to recall if the regulatory body\ndetermines, for any reason, that our products are not safe or effective. Any recall or additional regulatory approval or clearance requirements could result in\ndelays, costs associated with modification of a product, loss of revenue and potential operating restrictions imposed by the regulatory body, all of which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n21\nTable of Contents\nDemand for our products, and prices at which customers and patients are willing to pay for our products depend upon the ability of our customers to obtain\nadequate third-party coverage and reimbursement product purchases.\nSales of our products depend in part on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, principally Medicare, Medicaid\nand private health insurance plans, to pay for all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the use of our products. While procedures using our currently\nmarketed products are eligible for reimbursement in the U.S., if surgical procedures utilizing our products are performed on an outpatient basis, it is possible\nthat private payers may no longer provide reimbursement for the procedures using our products without further supporting data on the procedure. Any delays in\nobtaining, or an inability to obtain, adequate coverage or reimbursement for procedures using our products could significantly affect the acceptance of our\nproducts and have a significant adverse effect on our business. Additionally, third-party payers continue to review their coverage policies carefully for existing\nand new therapies and can, without notice, deny coverage for treatments that include the use of our products. Our business would be negatively impacted if\nthere are any changes that reduce reimbursement for our products.\nOperation of our business internationally is subject to our continued compliance with the laws and regulations of each country in which we operate, as well\nas the business and legal customs in those jurisdictions and geographies.\nOur operations, both inside and outside the U.S., are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and\ncustoms of various jurisdictions and geographies. Our operations outside the U.S. are subject to special risks and restrictions, including, without limitation:\nfluctuations in currency values and foreign-currency exchange rates; exchange control regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions;\ngovernmental pricing directives; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy; restrictions on the ability to repatriate\nfunds; and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad, including the\nU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets\nControl. Acts of terror or war may impair our ability to operate in particular countries or regions and may impede the flow of goods and services between\ncountries. Customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products, or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported\nproducts in their local currency, or sell at competitive prices, and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers. Further, changes in exchange\nrates may affect our net earnings, the book value of our assets outside the U.S. and our stockholders’ equity. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations that\naffect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Valence Transaction, as defined below.\nThe success of our acquisition of Valence (the \"Valence Transaction\") will depend on, among other things, our ability to incorporate Valence into our\nbusiness in a manner that enhances our value proposition to clients and facilitates other growth opportunities. If we are unable to successfully achieve these\nobjectives, the anticipated benefits of the Valence Transaction may not be realized fully, if at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Additionally,\nmanagement may face challenges in incorporating certain elements and functions of Valence with our business, and this process may result in additional and\nunforeseen expenses. The integration of Valence Transaction may also disrupt our ongoing business or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures\nand policies that adversely affect our relationships with third party partners, employees, suppliers, customers and others with whom we or the business related to\nValence have business or other dealings or limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Valance Transaction. If we are unable to successfully\nintegrate Valence into our existing business in an efficient, effective and timely manner, anticipated benefits, including the opportunities for expected growth\nfrom the Valence Transaction, may not be realized fully, if at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and our cash flow and financial condition may be\nnegatively affected.\n22\nTable of Contents\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to price concessions or exclusion of some suppliers from some markets, which could have an adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nContinued consolidation in the healthcare industry is expected to increase competition among providers of products and services to industry participants.\nThis in turn has resulted and will likely continue to result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as\nGPOs, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our\ncustomers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to impact the\nworldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may reduce competition, exert further\ndownward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse, health information privacy and security, and\ndisclosure laws, and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.\nAlthough we do not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from any third-party payers\nfor our products or the procedures in which our products are used, healthcare regulation significantly impacts our business. Healthcare fraud and abuse, health\ninformation privacy and security, and disclosure laws potentially applicable to our operations include:\n• the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as well as state analogs, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving,\noffering or providing remuneration, intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal (or\nstate or commercial) healthcare program (such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs);\n• federal and state bans on physician self-referrals, which prohibits, subject to exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare and Medicaid patients to\nan entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or its immediate family member has any financial relationship with the\nentity;\n• false claims laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare,\nMedicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n• HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit\nprogram or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n• the state and federal laws “sunshine” provisions that require detailed reporting and disclosures to the CMS and applicable states of any payments\nor “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other health care providers, and for certain states prohibit some forms of these\npayments, require the adoption of marketing codes of conduct, require the reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information and\nconstrain relationships with physicians and other referral sources;\n• the HITECH, which impose restrictions on uses and disclosures of protected health information and civil and criminal penalties for non-\ncompliance and require the reporting of breaches to affected individuals, the government and in some cases the media in the event of a violation;\nand\n• a variety of state-imposed privacy and data security laws which require the protection of personal information beyond health information and\nwhich require reporting to state officials in the event of breach or violation and which impose both civil and criminal penalties.\nIf our operations, or those of our independent sales agents violate any of such laws or any regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to civil\nand criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If the healthcare\nproviders, sales agents or other entities with which we do business are found to violate applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have\na negative impact on us. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business\nand our financial results.\n23\nTable of Contents\nSales and marketing practices in the healthcare industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from governmental agencies, and we believe that this\ntrend will continue. Prosecutorial scrutiny and governmental oversight over the retention of healthcare professionals as consultants has affected and may\ncontinue to affect how medical device companies retain healthcare professionals as consultants. Our efforts to detect and prevent noncompliance with applicable\nlaws may not be effective in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or\nregulations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and\ndivert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.\nIf we fail to timely obtain governmental clearances or approvals for our future products or modifications to our products, our ability to commercially\ndistribute and market our products could suffer.\nOur products are subject to extensive governmental regulations. The clearance and approval process, particularly with the FDA, can be costly and time\nconsuming, and such clearances or approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. In particular, the FDA permits commercial distribution of most new\nmedical devices only after receiving 510(k) clearance, or approval of a PMA. The FDA may make its 510(k) clearance process more restrictive and increase the\ntime or expense required to obtain clearances or could make it unavailable for some of our products. A PMA must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared\nthrough the 510(k) process or is not exempt from premarket review by the FDA and must be supported by extensive data, including results of preclinical studies\nand clinical trials, manufacturing and control data and proposed labeling, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for\nits intended use. The PMA process is more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. In addition, any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that\ncould significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture, requires a new 510(k)\nclearance or possibly a PMA.\nCommercial distribution and marketing of any of our products or product modifications will be delayed until regulatory clearance or approval is obtained\nwhich may take significantly longer than anticipated. Governmental authorities can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons,\nincluding:\n• our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority that our products are safe or effective for their intended uses,\nor that the clinical and other benefits of the device outweigh the risks;\n• disagreement of the applicable regulatory authority with the design or implementation of our clinical trials or the interpretation of data from pre-\nclinical studies or clinical trials;\n• serious and unexpected adverse effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials;\n• data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required;\n• our manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements; or\n• approval policies or regulations of the applicable regulatory authorities change significantly in a manner rendering our clinical data or regulatory\nfilings insufficient for clearance or approval.\nDelays in obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals may delay or prevent commercialization of products we develop, require us to perform costly\ntests or studies, diminish any competitive advantages that we might otherwise have obtained and reduce our ability to generate revenues.\n24\nTable of Contents\nIf we choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may be unable to complete these acquisitions or successfully\nintegrate them in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offering. Accordingly, we have pursued and intend to pursue\nthe acquisition of complementary businesses, products or technologies. We do not know if we will be able to successfully complete any acquisitions or\nsuccessfully integrate any acquired business. Our ability to successfully grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and\nintegrate suitable acquisition targets. These efforts could be expensive and time consuming, disrupt our ongoing business and distract management. If we are\nunable to integrate any future or recently acquired businesses, products or technologies effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations\nwill be materially adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on our senior management team, sales and marketing team, engineering team and key surgeon advisors, and the loss of any of them\ncould harm our business.\nOur continued success depends in part upon the continued availability and contributions of our senior management, sales and marketing team and\nengineering team and the continued participation of our key surgeon advisors. We compete for personnel and advisors with other companies and organizations,\nmany of which have greater name recognition and resources than we do. Changes to our senior management team, sales and marketing team, engineering team\nand key surgeon advisors, or our inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel or advisors, could have a significant adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent upon the effective operation of our information systems, software, or information security practices and those of our business\npartners or third-party service providers. Security breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our\nbusiness, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nWe utilize many information systems and other software that are critical to our business, some of which are managed by third parties. We regularly use\nthese information systems or software to collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected patient health and personally identifiable information,\nintellectual property information, and proprietary business information. We may be unable to maintain or improve our information systems and software or\nexperience unanticipated delays, complications, or expenses in implementing, integrating, and operating our systems or incur substantial expenditures or\ninterruptions in operations in connection with system improvements or implementations. The failure of our information systems or software or those of our\nbusiness partners or third-party service providers to perform properly could disrupt our business and harm our reputation, which may result in decreased sales,\nincreased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results to\nsuffer.\n25\nTable of Contents\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote\nsignificant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our\ninformation technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage, and interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including\nunauthorized access or security breaches, data privacy breaches, natural or man-made disasters, cyber attacks, computer viruses, malware, phishing, denial of\nservice attacks, power loss, or other disruptive events. Any such security incidents could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be\naccessed by unauthorized parties, disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such security incidents could also result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that\nprotect the privacy of personal information, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or disclosure could also\ninterrupt our operations and result in damage to our reputation, each of which could adversely affect our business. As a result of new SEC rules and regulations,\nwe are required to disclose, on a current basis pursuant to new Item 1.05 of SEC Form 8-K, any cybersecurity incident that we determine to be material and\ndescribe the material aspects of the nature, scope, and timing of the incident, as well as the material impact or reasonably likely material impact of the incident\non us, including our financial condition and results of operations. We will also be required to describe, on a periodic basis, our processes, if any, for the\nassessment, identification, and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats, and describe whether any risks from cybersecurity threats have\nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, our board’s oversight of risks\nfrom cybersecurity threats and management’s role in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. We have incurred significant costs in an\neffort to detect and prevent security breaches and incidents, and we may face increased costs and requirements to expend substantial resources in the event of an\nactual or perceived security breach or incident and to comply with this new SEC cybersecurity rule. Additionally, our insurance policies may not be adequate to\ncompensate us for the potential damages arising from any such disruption, failure or security breach or incident. In addition, such insurance may not be\navailable to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and could have high\ndeductibles in any event, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management attention.\nNearly all of our operations are currently conducted in locations that may be at risk of damage from fire, earthquakes or other natural disasters.\nWe conduct nearly all of our business activities in or near known wildfire areas and earthquake fault zones. We have taken precautions to safeguard our\nfacilities, including obtaining property and casualty insurance, and implementing health and safety protocols. We have developed an information technology\ndisaster recovery plan. However, any future natural disaster could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our equipment or inventory and\ncause us to incur additional expenses. A disaster could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance against\nearthquakes, fires, and other natural disasters would not be adequate to cover a total loss of our facilities, may not be adequate to cover our losses in any\nparticular case and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nPublic health crises, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may impact our business.\nA natural disaster (such as tsunami, power shortage, or flood), public health crisis (such as a pandemic or epidemic), political crisis (such as terrorism,\nwar, political instability or other conflict), or other events outside of our control that may occur and may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nMoreover, these types of events could negatively impact surgeon or patient spending in the impacted region(s), which could adversely impact our operating\nresults. We monitor such events and take actions that we deem reasonable given the circumstances. In the future other types of crises, may create an\nenvironment of business uncertainty around the world, which may hinder sales and/or supplies of our products nationally and internationally.\n26\nTable of Contents\nAlphatec Holdings is a holding company with no operations, and unless it receives dividends or other payments from its subsidiaries, it will be unable to\nfulfill its cash obligations.\nAs a holding company with no business operations, Alphatec Holdings’ material assets consist only of the common stock of its subsidiaries, dividends\nand other payments received from time to time from its subsidiaries, and the proceeds raised from the sale of debt and equity securities. Alphatec Holdings’\nsubsidiaries are legally distinct from Alphatec Holdings and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to Alphatec Holdings.\nAlphatec Holdings will have to rely upon dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its cash obligations.\nAlphatec Holdings may not be able to access cash generated by its subsidiaries in order to fulfill cash commitments. The ability of Alphatec Spine, SafeOp, or\nEOS to make dividend and other payments to Alphatec Holdings is subject to the availability of funds after taking into account its subsidiaries’ funding\nrequirements, the terms of its subsidiaries’ indebtedness and applicable state laws.\nIf we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth, our business could suffer.\nWhile we intend to continue to pursue growth in our business, such anticipated growth is expected to place significant demands on our managerial,\noperational and financial resources and systems. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention from day-to-day activities to\nmanaging these anticipated growth activities. If we do not manage our anticipated growth effectively, the quality of our products, our relationships with\nphysicians, sales agents and hospitals, and our reputation could suffer, which would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results, Credit and Certain Financial Obligations and Need for Financing\nWe may need to raise additional funds in the future and such funds may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nAt December 31, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $221.0 million, accounts receivable, net, cash from\noperations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility with entities affiliated with MidCap Financial Trust (\"Revolving Credit Facility\"). We\nbelieve that our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our planned expenditures and meet our obligations for at least 12 months subsequent to the\ndate the consolidated financial statements are issued. If needed, we will seek additional funds from public and private equity or debt financings, borrowings\nunder the Revolving Credit Facility, new debt facilities or other sources to fund our projected operating requirements. Our capital requirements will depend on\nmany factors, including:\n• the revenues generated by sales of our products;\n• the costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts;\n• the expenses that we incur from the manufacture of our products by third parties and that we incur from selling our products;\n• the costs of developing new products or technologies;\n• the cost of obtaining and maintaining FDA or other regulatory approval or clearance for our products and products in development;\n• the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights;\n• the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\n• the costs and any payments we may make related to our pending litigation matters;\n• the costs associated with increased capital expenditures; and\n• the costs associated with our employee retention programs and related benefits.\nAs a result of these factors, we may need to raise additional funds and such funds may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, rules and\nregulations of the SEC may restrict our ability to conduct certain types of financing activities or may affect the timing of and the amounts we can raise by\nundertaking such activities.\n27\nTable of Contents\nFurthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution and the new\nequity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. In addition, if we raise additional funds through\ncollaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies, or\nto grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to repay debt or other liabilities, develop\nor enhance our products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer\nrequirements. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals and have a significant adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCovenants in our loan documents and indenture may restrict our business and operations and if we do not effectively manage our covenants, our financial\ncondition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe loan agreements we entered into in connection with our Revolving Credit Facility and the Braidwell Term Loan as well as the indenture governing\nour outstanding 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the \"2026 Notes\") contain certain affirmative, operating or financial covenants. These covenants\ncould adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our liquidity or our results of operations, and our inability to comply with any of these covenants\ncould result in a default under the applicable loan agreement or indenture, which could result in an increase the applicable interest rate or all amounts borrowed\nunder the applicable debt instrument, together with accrued interest and other fees, to become due and payable or, with respect to our Revolving Credit Facility,\ncould result in MidCap refusing to make further extensions of credit to it. If our indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Braidwell Term Loan or\nthe 2026 Notes were to be accelerated, if the amount of interest owing under such debt or, in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility, if MidCap refuses to\nmake further extensions of credit to us, we may not have sufficient cash available to repay the amounts due, and we may be forced to seek an amendment to the\napplicable loan terms or obtain alternative financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, if we are unable to repay\noutstanding borrowings when due or upon an event of default, in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility and Braidwell Term Loan, the lender would also have\nthe right to proceed against the collateral, including substantially all of our assets, granted to secure the indebtedness under the debt obligation. If the applicable\nlender proceeds against the collateral, such assets would no longer be available for use in our business, which would have a significant adverse effect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a history of net losses, we expect to continue to incur net losses in the near future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have typically incurred net losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.1 billion. We have incurred\nsignificant net losses since inception and have relied on our ability to fund our operations through revenues from the sale of our products and equity and debt\nfinancings. Successful transition to profitability is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. This may not occur and,\nunless and until it does, we will continue to need to raise additional capital. We may seek additional funds from public and private equity or debt financings,\nborrowings under new debt facilities or other sources to fund our projected operating requirements. However, we may not be able to obtain further financing on\nreasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds on a timely basis, or at all, we would be materially adversely affected.\nA significant economic downturn or volatility in the economy in any market in which we operate could have a material adverse impact on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAs a result of our domestic and global business operations, our revenues are impacted by changes in domestic and global macroeconomic conditions.\nA weakening of economic conditions, including from a worsening of the ongoing labor shortage or rising in inflation, could lead to increased costs to our\nbusiness and reductions in demand for our products. Weakened economic conditions or a recession could reduce the amounts that customers are willing or able\nto spend on our products. Furthermore, a high percentage of our expenses, including those related to inventory, capital investments, and operating costs are\ngenerally fixed in nature in the short term. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from a weak or uncertain economic\nenvironment, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\n28\nTable of Contents\nOur quarterly financial results could fluctuate significantly.\nOur quarterly financial results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period, particularly because our sales prospects are\nuncertain. The level of our revenues and results of operations at any given time will be based primarily on the following factors:\n• acceptance of our products by spine surgeons, patients, hospitals and third-party payers;\n• demand and pricing of our products, and the mix of our products sold, because profit margins differ among our products;\n• timing of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors;\n• our ability to grow and maintain a productive sales and marketing organization and independent sales agent network;\n• regulatory approvals and legislative changes affecting the products we may offer or those of our competitors;\n• successful integration of newly acquired businesses, technology and personnel into our business operations;\n• the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n• levels of third-party reimbursement for our products;\n• interruption in the manufacturing or distribution of our products or our ability to produce or obtain products of satisfactory quality or in sufficient\nquantities to meet demand; and\n• changes in our ability to obtain FDA, state and international approval or clearance for our products.\nIn addition, until we have a larger base of spine surgeons using our products, occasional fluctuations in the use of our products by individual surgeons or\nsmall groups of surgeons will have a proportionately larger impact on our revenues than for companies with a larger customer base.\nWe cannot begin to commercialize any products that we seek to introduce in the U.S. without FDA approval or clearance. As a result, it will be difficult\nfor us to forecast demand for these products with any degree of certainty. Any shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by our stockholders or by\nindustry analysts could have a significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property, Regulatory Penalties and Litigation\nIf our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products, we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to\noperate our business profitably.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights in the technologies used in our products. We rely on patent protection,\nas well as a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary\ntechnology. These legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage.\nFor example, our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) may deny or require significant\nnarrowing of claims in our pending patent applications, and patents issued as a result of the pending patent applications, if any, may not provide us with\nsignificant commercial protection or be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. We could also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the PTO. These\nproceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of our inventions and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in issued patents. Issued patents\ncould subsequently be successfully challenged by others and invalidated or rendered unenforceable, which could limit our ability to prevent competitors from\nmarketing and selling related products. In addition, our pending patent applications include claims to aspects of our products and procedures that are not\ncurrently protected by issued patents.\n29\nTable of Contents\nBoth the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. Competitors may design around\nour patents or develop products that provide outcomes that are comparable to our products but fall outside of the scope of our patent protection. Although we\nhave entered into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with certain of our employees, consultants and advisors as one of\nthe ways we seek to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary technology, such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful\nprotection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements. In the event a\ncompetitor infringes upon one of our patents or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those patents and rights may be difficult and time consuming. Even\nif successful, litigation to defend our patents against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming and could\ndivert management’s attention from managing our business. Moreover, we may not have sufficient resources to defend our patents against challenges or to\nenforce our intellectual property rights.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by patent and other intellectual property litigation and we could become subject to litigation that could be\ncostly, result in the diversion of management’s time and efforts, require us to pay damages, and/or prevent us from marketing our existing or future\nproducts.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights.\nDetermining whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. Our competitors may\nassert that our products, components of those products, methods of using those products, or methods we employ to manufacture or process those products are\ncovered by patents held by them. In addition, they may claim that their patents have priority over ours because their patents were filed first. Because patent\napplications can take many years to issue, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware, which may later result in issued patents that our\nproducts may infringe. There could also be existing patents that one or more components of our products may be inadvertently infringing, of which we are\nunaware. As the number of participants in the market for spine disorder devices and treatments increases, the possibility of patent infringement claims against us\nalso increases.\nAny such claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial\nresources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. If the relevant patents are upheld as valid and enforceable and we\nare found to infringe, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or royalties and we could be prevented from selling our products unless we obtain a\nlicense or redesign our products to avoid infringement. Any such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and we may be unable to redesign\nour products to not infringe those patents, and any such redesign, if possible, may be costly. If we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary\nchanges to our products, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, either of\nwhich could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may lose market share to our competitors if we\nfail to protect our intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, we enter into agreements with spine surgeons to develop new products. As consideration for product development activities rendered\npursuant to these agreements, in some instances we have agreed to pay royalties on products developed by cooperative involvement between us and such\nsurgeons. The surgeons with whom we have entered into such an arrangement might claim to be entitled to a royalty even if we do not believe that such\nproducts were developed by cooperative involvement between us and such surgeons. Any such claim, even those without merit, may cause us to incur\nsubstantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our\nreputation.\n30\nTable of Contents\nIf we become subject to product liability claims, we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacture and sale of medical devices for spine surgery\nprocedures. Spine surgery involves significant risk of serious complications, including paralysis and even death. We carry product liability insurance. However,\nour product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to satisfy liabilities we might incur. Any product liability claim brought against us could result in the\nincrease of our product liability insurance rates or our inability to secure coverage in the future on commercially reasonable terms. If our product liability\ninsurance proves to be inadequate to pay a damage award, we may have to pay the excess out of our cash reserves, which could harm our financial condition. If\nlonger-term patient results and experience indicate that our products or any component of our products cause tissue damage, motor impairment or other adverse\neffects, we could be subject to significant liability. Even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could harm our reputation in the industry, lead to\nsignificant legal fees and result in the diversion of management’s attention from managing our business. If a product liability claim or series of claims is brought\nagainst us in excess of our insurance coverage limits, our business could suffer and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be\nmaterially adversely impacted.\nBecause biologics products entail a potential risk of communicable disease to human recipients, we may be the subject of product liability claims regarding\nour biologics products.\nOur biologics products may expose us to additional potential product liability claims. The development of biologics products entails the risk of\ntransmitting disease to human recipients, and substantial product liability claims may be asserted against us. In addition, successful product liability claims\nmade against one of our competitors could cause claims to be made against us or expose us to a perception that we are vulnerable to similar claims. Even a\nmeritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could harm our reputation in the industry, lead to significant legal fees and result in the diversion of\nmanagement’s attention from managing our business.\nAny claims relating to our improper handling, storage or disposal of biological, hazardous and radioactive materials could be time consuming and costly.\nThe manufacture of certain of our products, including our biologics products, involves the controlled use of biological, hazardous and/or radioactive\nmaterials and waste. Our business and facilities and those of our suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling\nand disposal of these materials and waste. Although we believe that our safety procedures comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely\neliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with\nfines, which could exceed our resources and insurance. We may incur significant expenses in the future relating to any failure to comply with applicable laws\nand regulations, which could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly, particularly if holders of substantial amounts of our stock attempt to sell, and holders may have difficulty selling\ntheir shares based on trading volumes of our stock.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including those described\nelsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section and the following:\n• volume and timing of orders for our products;\n• quarterly variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations;\n• our announcement or our competitors’ announcements regarding new or enhanced products, product enhancements, significant contracts, number\nof sales agents, number of hospitals and spine surgeons using products, acquisitions, and collaborative or strategic investments;\n• announcements of technological or medical innovations for the treatment of spine pathology;\n• changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n31\nTable of Contents\n• our ability to develop, obtain regulatory clearance or approval for, and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n• changes in healthcare policy in the U.S., including changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals, clearances or\napplications, and changes in the availability of third-party reimbursement in the U.S.;\n• product liability claims or other litigation involving us, including disputes or other developments with respect to intellectual property rights;\n• sales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n• changes in accounting principles; and\n• general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our\ncompetitors.\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management’s attention and harm our business.\nThe stock market in general, the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the market for medical device companies in particular, has experienced price and\nvolume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, following periods of\nvolatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities, the company becomes subject to securities class action litigation. We may become involved in\nthis type of litigation. Litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition,\nresults of operations and business.\nSecurities analysts may not provide coverage of our common stock or may issue negative reports, which may have a negative impact on the market price of\nour common stock.\nSecurities analysts may not provide research coverage of our common stock. The trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the\nresearch and reports that analysts publish about our business. If one or more of the analysts who elects to cover us downgrades our stock, our stock price could\nlikely decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to\ndecline.\nBecause of their significant stock ownership, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders will be able to exert control over us and our\nsignificant corporate decisions.\nBased on shares outstanding at February 19, 2024, our executive officers, directors and stockholders holding more than 5% of our outstanding common\nstock and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 30% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these persons will have the\nability to impact significantly the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger,\nconsolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by delaying,\ndeferring or preventing our change in control, causing us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all of our stockholders, or\nreducing our public float held by non-affiliates.\n32\nTable of Contents\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and change of control provisions in some of our employment agreements and agreements with\nsales agents, and in some of our outstanding debt agreements, as well as the terms of our redeemable preferred stock, may discourage or prevent a change\nof control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and restated by-laws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition\nor other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for\ntheir shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing\nthe market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. Furthermore, these\nprovisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions:\n• allow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our Board of Directors;\n• allow vacancies on our Board of Directors to be filled only by resolution of our Board of Directors;\n• authorize our Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, blank check preferred stock that, if issued, could operate as a “poison\npill” to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our Board of Directors;\n• require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n• establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our Board of Directors and for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at\nstockholder meetings; and\n• limit who may call stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for\nstockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in\nDelaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.\nSome of our agreements provide for accelerated vesting of benefits, including full vesting of restricted stock and options, upon a change of control, or\nextends the term of the agreement upon a change in control and make it more difficult for us or our successor to terminate the agreement. These provisions may\ndiscourage or prevent a change of control.\nIn addition, in the event of a change of control, we would be required to redeem all outstanding shares of our redeemable preferred stock for an\naggregate of $29.9 million, at the price of $9.00 per share. Further, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation permits us to issue additional shares of\npreferred stock. The terms of our redeemable preferred stock or any new preferred stock we may issue could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing\na change in control.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as\na cumulative change in its equity ownership by “5-percent shareholders” of greater than 50 percentage points (by value) over a three-year period, the\ncorporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”), and certain other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to\noffset its post-change taxable income and taxes may be limited. We have completed multiple rounds of financing and entered into transactions which may\nsubject us to the Section 382 limitations. We may also experience ownership changes in the future. As a result, our ability to use our NOLs and research and\ndevelopment credits to offset our U.S. federal taxable income and taxes may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax\nliability to us. In addition, similar rules may also apply at the state level, and there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or limited, which\ncould accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\n33\nTable of Contents\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates, new tax legislation or additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate our worldwide tax liabilities.\nDue to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our effective income tax rates have been, and\ncould in the future be, adversely affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those tax laws; by stock-based compensation and other non-deductible\nexpenses; by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates; or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and\nliabilities.\nOur tax returns and other tax matters also are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental\nbodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. We\ncannot guarantee the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S., or if the ultimate determination of our\ntaxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe recognize the need to maintain the security and confidentiality of personal information, protected health information, and other confidential data that\nwe collect and use in connection with our business, and the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing various cybersecurity risks that may impact our\nbusiness. We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of\nour critical systems and information. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan.\nWe design and assess our program based on various cybersecurity frameworks, most prominently the Health Information Trust Alliance (“HITRUST”)\nCommon Security Framework, and Service Organization Controls (“SOC”) 2, developed by the American Institute of CPAs. In 2023, our cybersecurity systems\nand services issued a SOC 2 Type 1 report for the design of our security processes. We use this cybersecurity framework and information security controls as a\nguide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business. Our cybersecurity program includes annual review and assessment by\nexternal, independent third parties, who certify and report on these programs.\nAs part of our enterprise risk management process, we assess the various cybersecurity risks that may impact our business and implement plans and\ninitiatives that are intended to mitigate those risks.\nOur information security program includes: (i) risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems,\ninformation, products, software, and services; (ii) an information security team principally responsible for managing our (1) information security risk\nassessment processes, (2) security controls, and (3) response to cybersecurity incidents; (iii) risk assessments and security tests, conducted internally and by\nexternal security and risk audit providers, as appropriate; (iv) new-hire and annual cybersecurity awareness training of our employees; (v) a cybersecurity\nincident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and (vi) third-party risk assessment procedures to review material\nthird-party vendors and applications for information security.\nWe have not identified any risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially\naffected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\n34\nTable of Contents\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit Committee oversight over our information\nsecurity and technology risks, including our information security, cybersecurity and related risk management programs. The Audit Committee oversees\nmanagement’s implementation of our information security program and receives periodic reports from management on our material cybersecurity risks.\nAdditionally, management updates the Audit Committee, as necessary, regarding material cybersecurity incidents. The full Board receives quarterly updates\nfrom management on our information security program.\nOur management team, including our IT management team, is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. The\nteam has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our\nretained external cybersecurity consultants. To support data security, we have established an integrated risk management framework with practices that are\nderived from industry standards, including ISO 27001, HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) 11.2 certification, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework,\nand data privacy regulations, including HIPAA and the General Data Protection Regulation. The data security controls from these standards and regulations are\nevaluated for our risk management framework based on the needs of our business and our clients, the nature of our industry, and applicable regulations.\nOur management team oversees efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may\ninclude briefings from internal security personnel, threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public, or private sources, including\nexternal consultants engaged by us, and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the information technology environment.\nItem 2.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “ATEC.”\nStockholders\nAs of February 19, 2024, there were approximately 381 holders of record of an aggregate 137,979,126 outstanding shares of our common stock.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in\nthe operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued unregistered equity securities as described below:\nOn October 2, 2023 and November 14, 2023, the Company issued 625 and 1,250 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock with a grant date fair\nvalues of $12.58 and $9.94, respectively, based on the market price of common stock on the respective grant dates, to an independent sales agent for distribution\nand related services rendered to the Company.\nOn October 2, 2023, the Company issued 795 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock with a grant date fair values of $12.58 based on the\nmarket price of common stock on the grant date, to an independent sales agent for distribution and related services rendered to the Company.\nThe issuances of the foregoing securities were made in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended, as there was no general solicitation and the transactions did not involve a public offering.\nPurchases of Equity Securities\nUnder the terms of our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and our Amended and Restated 2005 Employee, Director and Consultant Stock Plan, as amended,\nwhich we refer to collectively as the Stock Plans, and prior to the expiration of the Stock Plans in May 2026, we are permitted to award shares of restricted\nstock to our employees, directors, and consultants. These shares of restricted stock are subject to a lapsing right of repurchase by us. We may exercise this right\nof repurchase in the event that a restricted stock recipient’s employment, directorship or consulting relationship with us terminates prior to the end of the vesting\nperiod. If we exercise this right, we are required to repay the purchase price paid by or on behalf of the recipient for the repurchased restricted shares.\nRepurchased shares are returned to the Stock Plans and are available for future awards under the terms of the Stock Plans.\nThere were no repurchases of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n36\nTable of Contents\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return data on our common stock with the cumulative return of two indices: (i) The\nNasdaq Stock Market Composite Index, and (ii) The Nasdaq Medical Equipment Index over the five-year period ending December 31, 2023.

For discussion regarding our financial condition and the results of\noperations for 2022 compared to 2021, refer to Part II, Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nSome of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report include the identification of certain trends and\nother statements that may predict or anticipate future business or financial results that are subject to important factors that could cause our actual results to\ndiffer materially from those indicated. See “Item 1A Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a medical technology company, headquartered in Carlsbad, California, focused on the design, development, and advancement of technology for\nbetter surgical treatment of spine disorders. By applying our unique, 100% spine focus and deep, collective industry know-how, we aim to revolutionize the\napproach to spine surgery through clinical distinction. The sophisticated approaches that we create from the ground up integrate with our expanding Alpha\nInformatiX™ product platform to objectively inform surgery and achieve the goals of spine surgery more predictably and more reproducibly. We have a\ncomprehensive product portfolio designed to address the spine’s various pathologies, and are perpetually innovating to accomplish our ultimate vision, which is\nto be the standard bearer in spine.\nThe application of our team’s deep spine know-how, coupled with a willingness to invest holistically in each of the technologies integrated into all of\nATEC’s procedural approaches continues to increasingly compel surgeons and sales talent to partner with us. That adoption-driven validation has been the\nsource of industry-leading market share expansion, which has delivered an approximately 40% revenue compound annual growth rate since our transformation\ncommenced in 2018.\nWe market and sell our products through a network of independent sales agents and direct sales representatives. To deliver consistent, predictable\ngrowth, we have added, and intend to continue to add, clinically astute and exclusive sales team members to reach untapped surgeons, hospitals, and national\naccounts and better penetrate existing accounts and territories.\nRecent Developments\nPublic Offering\nOn October 27, 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering (the “Public Offering”) of 14,300,000 shares of our common stock at a price of\n$10.50 per share. In connection with the Public Offering, we granted the underwriters a 30-day option (the \"Green-Shoe\") to purchase additional shares of\ncommon stock in the offering at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The net proceeds from the Public Offering and Green-\nShoe, were approximately $145.8 million, including the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us. We expect to use the net\nproceeds from the Public Offering to fund general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or research and\ndevelopment.\nAsset Purchase Agreement\nOn April 19, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Integrity Implants Inc. and Fusion Robotics, LLC (collectively, the “Sellers”),\nwhereby we acquired certain assets, liabilities, employees, and contracts in connection with the Sellers’ navigation-enabled robotics platform (“Valence”). We\npaid the Sellers cash consideration of $55.0 million for the purchase of Valence.\n38\nTable of Contents\nUnderwritten Offering\nOn April 19, 2023, we completed a registered securities offering (the “Offering”) of 4,285,715 shares of our common stock at a price of $14.00 per\nshare. The net proceeds from the Offering were approximately $57.5 million, including the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid\nby us. We used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to fund the purchase of Valence. We expect to use the remaining proceeds to fund the costs related to\nthe post-closing integration and research and development activities related to Valence, as well as to fund general corporate purposes, including working capital,\ncapital expenditures, acquisitions, or research and development.\nTerm Loan\nOn January 6, 2023, we entered into a $150.0 million term loan credit facility with Braidwell Transaction Holdings, LLC (the “Braidwell Term Loan”).\nThe Braidwell Term Loan provided for an initial term loan of $100.0 million which was funded on the closing date. On September 28, 2023, we drew the\nadditional $50.0 million (the “delayed draw term loan(s)” or the “DDTL”). The Braidwell Term Loan matures on January 6, 2028. Borrowings under the\nBraidwell Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate for such SOFR business day (\"SOFR\") subject to a\n3% floor, plus 5.75%.\nRevenue and Expense Components\nThe following is a description of the primary components of our revenue and expenses:\nRevenue. We derive our revenue primarily from the sale of spinal surgery implants used in the treatment of spine disorders as well as the sale of medical\nimaging equipment which is used for surgical planning and post-operative assessment. Spinal implant products include pedicle screws and complementary\nimplants, interbody devices, plates, and tissue-based materials. Medical imaging equipment includes our EOS full-body and weight-bearing x-ray imaging\ndevices, and related services. Our revenue is generated by our direct sales force and independent sales agents. Our products are shipped and invoiced to\nhospitals and surgical centers. Currently, most of our business is conducted with customers within markets in which we have experience and with payment\nterms that are customary to our business. We may defer revenue until the time of collection if circumstances related to payment terms, regional market risk or\ncustomer history indicate that collectability is not certain.\nCost of sales. Cost of sales consists primarily of direct product costs, royalties, service labor hours, and parts. Our product costs consist primarily of raw\nmaterials, component parts, direct labor, and overhead. The product costs of certain of our biologics products include the cost of procuring and processing\nhuman tissue. We incur royalties related to the technologies that we license from others and the products that are developed in part by surgeons with whom we\ncollaborate in the product development process.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with the design, development, testing, and\nenhancement of our products. Research and development expenses also include salaries and related employee benefits, research-related overhead expenses, and\nfees paid to external service providers and development consultants in the form of both cash and equity.\nSales, general and administrative expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employee benefits, sales\ncommissions and other variable costs, depreciation of our surgical instruments, regulatory affairs, quality assurance costs, professional service fees, travel,\nmedical education, trade show and marketing costs, and insurance expenses.\nLitigation-related expenses. Litigation-related expenses are costs incurred for our ongoing and settled litigation.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and\nasset purchases.\nTransaction-related expenses. Transaction-related expenses consist of certain costs incurred related primarily to the acquisition and integration of\nValence.\n39\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring expenses. Restructuring expenses primarily consist of severance, social plan benefits and related tax costs incurred in connection with cost\nrationalization efforts, as well as costs associated with the opening or closing of office and warehouse facilities.\nTotal interest and other expense, net. Total interest and other expense, net includes interest income, interest expense, gains and losses from foreign\ncurrency exchanges and other non-operating gains and losses.\nIncome tax provision. Income tax provision primarily consists of an estimate of federal, state, and foreign income taxes based on enacted state and\nforeign tax rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions, uncertain tax positions, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and\nchanges in tax laws.\nResults of Operations\nTotal revenue\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n(in thousands, except %) 2023 2022 $ %\nRevenue:\nRevenue from products and services $ 482,262 $ 350,852 $ 131,410 37%\nRevenue from international supply agreement — 15 (15) (100)%\nTotal revenue $ 482,262 $ 350,867 $ 131,395 37%\nRevenue from products and services increased by $131.4 million, or 37%, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in product volume that was due to the increase in our surgeon user base, continued expansion\nof our product portfolio, and increasing adoption of our technology.\nCost of sales\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n(in thousands, except %) 2023 2022 $ %\nCost of sales $ 172,059 $ 117,808 $ 54,251 46%\nCost of sales increased by $54.3 million, or 46%, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The\nincrease was primarily due to an increase in product volume and an increase in stock-based compensation. We have entered into Development Service\nAgreements for the development of a wide variety of potential products and intellectual property. Under these agreements, future payments for product and/or\nintellectual property rights may be paid in either cash or restricted shares of our common stock at the election of the developer, depending on the terms of the\nagreement. Certain of these agreements have been amended to remove the cash option and require settlement in restricted shares of our common stock. During\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, the vesting conditions of certain of these amended awards were deemed probable, resulting in an increase in stock-based\ncompensation for the year.\nOperating expenses\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n(in thousands, except %) 2023 2022 $ %\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 70,115 $ 44,033 $ 26,082 59%\nSales, general and administrative 374,080 300,013 74,067 25%\nLitigation-related expenses 22,287 23,943 (1,656) (7)%\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 14,284 10,115 4,169 41%\nTransaction-related expenses 2,113 120 1,993 1,661%\nRestructuring expenses 719 1,810 (1,091) (60)%\nTotal operating expenses $ 483,598 $ 380,034 $ 103,564 27%\n40\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased by $26.1 million, or 59%, during the year ended December 31,\n2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel to support the expansion of our new product\nportfolio and an increase in stock-based compensation associated with Development Service Agreements described above.\nSales, general and administrative expenses. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by $74.1 million, or 25%, during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation-related costs and variable selling\nexpenses associated with the increase in revenue, and our continued investment in building our strategic sales channel. Additionally, we have increased our\ninvestment in our sales and marketing functions by increasing headcount to support the growth of our business.\nLitigation-related expenses. Litigation-related expenses decreased by $1.7 million, or 7%, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in legal fees associated with our previously settled litigation matters. Refer to\nNote 7 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding litigation\nmatters.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. The increase of amortization of acquired intangible assets is primarily due to the amortization of intangible\nassets acquired in the Valence acquisition.\nTransaction-related expenses. The increase in transaction-related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily due to the closing of the\nValence acquisition.\nRestructuring expenses. The decrease in restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2023 is due to cost rationalization efforts that were\ncompleted during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nTotal interest and other expense, net\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n(in thousands, except %) 2023 2022 $ %\nInterest and other income, net:\nInterest expense, net $ (16,641) $ (5,505) $ (11,136) 202%\nOther income, net 3,121 471 2,650 563%\nTotal interest and other income, net $ (13,520) $ (5,034) $ (8,486) 169%\nThe increase in interest expense, net, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 30, 2022, was primarily due to\ninterest on our revolving credit facility and Braidwell Term Loan which were executed in September 2022 and January 2023, respectively. The change in other\nincome, net, compared to the same in 2022, was primarily due to an employee retention credit received during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIncome tax provision\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n(in thousands, except %) 2023 2022 $ %\nIncome tax provision $ (277) $ (716) $ 439 (61)%\nIncome tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2023 was negligible and remained consistent compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\n41\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, our Revolving Credit Facility, and cash from operations. Our liquidity and\ncapital structure are evaluated regularly within the context of our annual operating and strategic planning process. We consider the liquidity necessary to fund\nour operations, which includes working capital needs, investments in research and development, investments in inventory and instrument sets to support our\ncustomers, as well as other operating costs. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and\nextent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales, marketing and administrative activities, the timing of introductions of new products\nand enhancements to existing products, and the international expansions of our business.\nAs current borrowing sources become due, we may be required to access the capital markets for additional funding. If we are required to access the debt\nmarkets, we expect to be able to secure reasonable borrowing rates. As part of our liquidity strategy, we will continue to monitor our current level of spending\nand cash use as well as our ability to secure additional credit facilities, term loans, or other similar arrangements in light of our spending levels and general\nfinancial market conditions.\nA substantial portion of our operations are in the U.S., and most of our net sales have been made in the U.S. Accordingly, we do not have material\nexposures to foreign currency rate fluctuations from operations. However, as our business in markets outside of the U.S. continues to increase, we will be\nexposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our foreign operations.\nWe do not have any material financial exposure to one customer or one country that would significantly hinder our liquidity. We are and may become\ninvolved in various legal proceedings arising from our business activities. While we have no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual\namounts are not disclosed in our consolidated financial statements, litigation is inherently unpredictable, and depending on the nature and timing of a\nproceeding, an unfavorable resolution could materially affect our future consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period.\nWe assess contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for potential accrual or disclosure in our consolidated financial\nstatements. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in our consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of\nthe loss can be reasonably estimated. Assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events because litigation is inherently\nunpredictable, and unfavorable resolutions could occur. When evaluating contingencies, we may be unable to provide a meaningful estimate due to a number of\nfactors, including the procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development\nof information important to the matters. In addition, damage amounts claimed in litigation against us may be unsupported, exaggerated, or unrelated to\nreasonably possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of our potential liability. We have disclosed all material accruals for pending litigation\nor investigations in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nCash and cash equivalents were $221.0 million and $84.7 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. We have available\nborrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility discussed above. We believe that our existing funds, cash generated from our operations and our existing\nsources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure, debt service requirements and other business\ninitiatives we plan to strategically pursue.\n42\nTable of Contents\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following is a summary of cash (used in) provided by operating, investing, and financing activities, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and\ncash equivalents, and the net change in cash and cash equivalents:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCash (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities $ (78,485) $ (75,134) $ (73,317)\nInvesting activities (141,975) (58,280) (157,762)\nFinancing activities 356,919 31,228 311,966\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash (185) (366) (1,404)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents $ 136,274 $ (102,552) $ 79,483\nOperating Activities\nWe used net cash of $78.5 million from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023. The cash used in operating activities primarily related\nto costs associated with the continued expansion of our business and inventory purchases, offset by the timing of cash payments and receipts.\nInvesting Activities\nWe used cash of $142.0 million in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is primarily related to the acquisition of Valence and\npurchase of surgical instruments to support the commercial launch of new products and growth of our business.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities provided net cash of $356.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is primarily related to net proceeds from the\nBraidwell Term Loan, the Revolving Credit Facility, and the equity offerings described above, offset by payment of outstanding OCEANEs, defined below.\nDebt and Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $150.0 million outstanding under the Braidwell Term Loan. The outstanding loans under the Braidwell Term Loan\nbear interest at the sum of SOFR plus 5.75% per annum. The Braidwell Term Loan matures on January 6, 2028.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $49.7 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The outstanding loans bear interest at the sum of SOFR\nplus 3.5% per annum. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of September 29, 2027, or 90 days prior to the final maturity date of any of our\noutstanding 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the \"2026 Notes\").\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $316.3 million outstanding under the 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes accrue interest at a rate of 0.75%, payable semi-\nannually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year. Prior to maturity in August 2026, the holders of the 2026 Notes may, under certain circumstances,\nchoose to convert their notes into shares of our common stock. Based on the terms, we have the option to pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a\ncombination thereof, when a conversion notice is received.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $4.5 million in other debts that are due in monthly and quarterly installments through maturity in 2027.\nWe have an inventory purchase commitment agreement with a third-party supplier, where we are obligated to certain minimum purchase commitment\nrequirements through December 2025. As of December 31, 2023, the remaining minimum purchase commitment under the agreement was $13.9 million.\n43\nTable of Contents\nContractual obligations and commercial commitments\nTotal contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2023 are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\n(cid:0)(cid:3) Payments Due by Period\nTotal 1 Year or Less More than 1 Year\n2026 Notes $ 316,250 $ — $ 316,250\nBraidwell Term Loan, including final payment fee of $4,875 154,875 — 154,875\nInterest expense(1) 76,577 19,760 56,817\nRevolving Credit Facility 49,720 — 49,720\nFacility lease obligations (2) 34,209 5,505 28,704\nPurchase commitments (3) 13,887 4,529 9,358\nOther (4) 4,811 1,584 3,227\nDevelopment services plans 1,248 — 1,248\nTotal $ 651,577 $ 31,378 $ 620,199\n(1) Represents interest expense from our debt that we expect to pay in the future.\n(2) Includes our headquarters building lease that commenced in February 2021.\n(3) Includes inventory purchase commitments of $13.9 million.\n(4) Represents cash repayments of government sponsored COVID relief initiatives at EOS.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. On an on-going basis, we\nevaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowances for accounts receivable, inventories and intangible assets,\nstock-based compensation and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable\nunder the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent\nfrom other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumption conditions.\nWe believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial\nstatements.\n44\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification\n(“ASC”) Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”). This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the\nscope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements, and financial instruments. Under Topic 606, an entity recognizes revenue when\nits customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those\ngoods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the\nfollowing five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price;\n(iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance\nobligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods\nor services that we transfer to the customer.\nSales are derived primarily from the sale of spinal implant products, imaging equipment, and related services to hospitals and medical centers through\ndirect sales representatives and independent sales agents. Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with customers are satisfied,\nwhich occurs with the transfer of control of products to customers, either upon shipment of the product or delivery of the product to the customer depending on\nthe shipping terms, or when the products are used in a surgical procedure (implanted in a patient). Revenue from the sale of imaging equipment is recognized as\neach distinct performance obligation is fulfilled and control transfers to the customer, beginning with shipment or delivery, depending on the terms. Revenue\nfrom other distinct performance obligations, such as maintenance on imaging equipment, and other imaging related services, is recognized in the period the\nservice is performed, and makes up less than 10% of our total revenue. Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration expected to be received in\nexchange for the transfer of the goods or services specified in the contract with each customer. In certain cases, we offer the ability for customers to lease our\nimaging equipment primarily on a non-sales type basis, but such arrangements are immaterial to total revenue in the years presented. We generally do not allow\nreturns of products that have been delivered. Costs incurred by us associated with sales contracts with customers are deferred over the performance obligation\nperiod and recognized in the same period as the related revenue, except for contracts that complete within one year or less, in which case the associated costs are\nexpensed as incurred. Payment terms for sales to customers may vary but are commensurate with the general business practices in the country of sale.\nTo the extent that the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as discounts, rebates, and customer payment penalties, we estimate the\namount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method\ndepending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a\nsignificant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include\nestimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available,\nincluding historical, current, and forecasted information.\nWe record a contract asset when one or more performance obligations have been completed and revenue has been recognized, but the customer's\npayment is contingent on the satisfaction of additional performance obligations. We record a contract liability, or deferred revenue, when we have an obligation\nto provide a product or service to the customer and payment is received in advance of our performance. When we sell a product or service with a future\nperformance obligation, revenue is deferred on the unfulfilled performance obligation and recognized over the related performance period. Generally, we do not\nhave observable evidence of the standalone selling price related to our future service obligations; therefore, we estimate the selling price using an expected cost\nplus a margin approach. The transaction price is allocated using the relative standalone selling price method. The use of alternative estimates could result in a\ndifferent amount of revenue deferral.\n45\nTable of Contents\nExcess and Obsolete Inventory\nMost of our inventory is comprised of finished goods, and we primarily utilize third-party suppliers to produce our products. Specialized implants,\nfixation products, and biologics are determined by utilizing a standard cost method, which includes capitalized variances, which approximates the weighted\naverage cost. Imaging equipment and related parts are valued at weighted average cost. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We\nreview the components of inventory on a periodic basis for excess and obsolescence and adjust inventory to its net realizable value as necessary.\nWe record a lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserve (“LCNRV”) for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon our expected use\nof inventory on hand. Our inventory, which consists primarily of specialized implants, fixation products, and biologics is at risk of obsolescence due to the need\nto maintain substantial levels of inventory. In order to market our products effectively and meet the demands of interoperative product placement, we maintain\nand provide surgeons and hospitals with a variety of inventory products and sizes. For each surgery, fewer than all components will be consumed. The need to\nmaintain and provide such a variety of inventory causes inventory to be held that is not likely to be used.\nOur estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. The estimates and assumptions are\ndetermined primarily based on current usage of inventory and the age of inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, we consider recent sales experience to\ndevelop assumptions about future demand for our products, while considering product life cycles and new product launches. Increases in the LCNRV reserve\nfor excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding charge to cost of sales.\nValuation of Goodwill\nOur goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from our business combinations. The determination of the value\nof goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations and asset acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to\nallocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is assessed for impairment using fair value measurement\ntechniques on an annual basis or more frequently if facts and circumstance warrant such a review. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that\nthe carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its respective fair value.\nValuation of Intangible Assets\nOur intangible assets are comprised primarily of purchased technology, customer relationships, trade name, trademarks, and in-process research and\ndevelopment. We make significant judgments in relation to the valuation of intangible assets resulting from business combinations and asset acquisitions.\nIntangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 2 to 12 years. We base the useful lives and related\namortization expense on the period of time we estimate the assets will generate net sales or otherwise be used. We also periodically review the lives assigned to\nour intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows. If a change\nwere to occur in any of the above-mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase. We evaluate our\nintangible assets with finite lives for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating\nresults, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic\ntrends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value\nof the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future\ncash flows of the asset over the remaining amortization period, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the\nremaining amortization period. Significant judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow valuation\nmodels. It is possible that plans may change and estimates used may prove to be inaccurate. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future\nimpairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges.\n46\nTable of Contents\nIn-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") and software in development have indefinite lives and are not amortized until the related products\nreach full commercial launch or when the projects are complete and their assets are ready for their intended use. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered\nto be impaired if the products do not reach commercial launch, if the project is not completed or not completed in a timely manner, or if the related products or\nprojects are no longer technologically feasible. Impairment related to IPR&D and software in development is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying\nvalue over its fair value.\nValuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense for equity-classified awards, principally related to restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance restricted stock\nunits (\"PRSUs\") is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award. The fair value of equity instruments that are expected to vest is\nrecognized and amortized over the requisite service period. We have granted awards with up to four year graded or cliff vesting terms. No exercise price or\nother monetary payment is required for receipt of the shares issued in settlement of the respective award; instead, consideration is furnished in the form of the\nparticipant’s service.\nThe fair value of RSUs including PRSUs with pre-defined performance criteria is based on the stock price on the date of grant whereas the expense for\nPRSUs with pre-defined performance criteria is adjusted with the probability of achievement of such performance criteria at each year end.\nStock-based compensation recorded in our consolidated statements of operations is based on awards expected to ultimately vest and has been reduced for\nestimated forfeitures. Our estimated forfeiture rates may differ from our actual forfeitures. We consider our historical experience of pre-vesting forfeitures on\nawards by each homogenous group of employees as the basis to arrive at our estimated annual pre-vesting forfeiture rates.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options issued under our equity incentive plans and shares issued to employees under our employee stock purchase\nplan (\"ESPP\"), using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions\nincluding expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the\nmost recent period commensurate with the estimated expected term of our stock options and ESPP offering period which is derived from historical experience.\nThe risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. We have never\ndeclared or paid dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.\nAwards to non-employees are accounted for under the same stock-based compensation provisions as employees, which require that the fair value of\nthese instruments be recognized as an expense when earned. For Development Service Agreements, where the future payments for product and/or intellectual\nproperty rights may be paid in either cash or restricted shares of our common stock at the election of the developer we estimate the fair value of those awards\nsimilar to a stock option, using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant. For Development Service Agreements where the future payments for\nproduct and/or intellectual property rights will be paid in restricted shares of our common stock, the fair value is based on the stock price on the date of grant.\nThe stock-based compensation expense is recognized as earned once the award is deemed probable of achieving the pre-defined performance criteria. The\nstock-based compensation expense is included in cost of sales or research and development expense on the consolidated statements of operations commensurate\nwith the nature of services performed.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements.\nSee “Notes to Financial Statements - Note 1 - Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\n47\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risks related to our cash, cash equivalents and borrowings. We had cash and cash equivalents of 221.0 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023, which consist of cash and money market funds. Interest-earning deposit accounts and money market funds carry a degree of interest rate\nrisk; however, historical fluctuations in interest income have not been significant.\nLoans under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Braidwell Term Loan bear interest at floating rates tied to SOFR. As a result, changes in SOFR can\naffect our results of operation and cash flows. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance under the Braidwell Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility\nwas $150.0 million and $49.7 million, respectively. The interest rates for the Braidwell Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023 were\n11.2% and 9.0%, respectively.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nAs our business in markets outside of the U.S. continues to increase, we may be exposed to foreign currency exchange risks related to our foreign\noperations. Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. and foreign currencies, primarily the euro, could adversely affect our financial results. We do\nnot have any material financial exposure to one customer or one country that would significantly hinder our liquidity.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe purchase raw materials that are processed from commodities, such as titanium and stainless steel. These purchases expose us to fluctuations in\ncommodity prices. Given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices, this exposure can impact our product costs. However, because our raw material\nprices comprise a small portion of our cost of sales, we have not experienced any material impact on our results of operations from changes in commodity\nprices. A 10% change in commodity prices would not have had a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe consolidated financial statements and supplementary data required by this item are set forth at the pages indicated in Item 15.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange\nAct is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timelines specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter\nhow well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of\nassurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\n48\nTable of Contents\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried\nout an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in SEC Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) of the\nExchange Act) as of December 31, 2023. Based on such evaluation, our management has concluded as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\nExchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nManagement has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control - Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023, based on those criteria.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, who audited the consolidated financial statements included in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. This report\nstates that internal control over financial reporting was effective and appears in “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” in Part IV, Item 15\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe are involved in ongoing evaluations of internal controls. In anticipation of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of other members of our management, performed an evaluation of any change in internal control over\nfinancial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over\nfinancial reporting. We are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system that affects many of our financial processes and\nis expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes, as well as the underlying systems environment.\nThere has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nAdoption, Modification or Termination of Trading Arrangements\nA portion of the compensation of our directors and officers is in the form of equity awards, and, from time to time, directors and officers engage in open-\nmarket transactions with respect to the securities they acquire pursuant to such equity awards we have issued.\nTransactions in our securities by directors and officers are required to be made in accordance with our insider trading policy, which requires that the\ntransactions comply with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under\nthe Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables directors and officers to prearrange transactions in our securities in a manner that avoids concerns\nabout initiating transactions while in possession of material nonpublic information.\nThe following table describes the contracts, instructions or written plans for the purchase or sale of securities adopted by our directors or officers (as\ndefined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2023, that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense\nconditions of Rule 10b5-1(c). No other Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements” (as defined by S-K Item 408(c)) were\nentered into or terminated by our directors or officers during such period:\n49\nTable of Contents\nName Title of Director or Officer Action Date Total Shares to be Sold Expiration Date\nJ.

In our opinion, the financial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nValuation of Inventories - Refer to Note 1 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company records its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“LCNRV”). A portion of the Company’s LCNRV reserve represents an amount\nfor specialized implants and fixation products (collectively “implant inventory”). Quarterly, the Company records an adjustment to its LCNRV reserve for\nestimated excess and obsolete implant inventory based upon its expected use of implant inventory on hand. To determine the expected use of implant inventory,\nmanagement develops estimates and assumptions primarily based on the current usage of implant inventory, and the age of implant inventory quantities on\nhand. Additionally, the Company considers recent sales experience to develop assumptions about future demand for its products, while considering product life\ncycles and new product launches.\nWe identified management’s estimation of the implant inventory LCNRV reserve as a critical audit matter due to management’s significant manual process used\nto determine the estimate and the judgments required by management to estimate future use of their products. This required a high degree of auditor judgment\nand an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to the expected use of\nimplant inventory in future operations.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s judgments used to estimate the implant inventory LCNRV reserve included the following, among others:\n• We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s estimate of the implant inventory LCNRV reserve, including:\no management’s assessment of assumptions used to identify excess and obsolete implant inventory and to estimate the related LCNRV\nreserve.\no the completeness and accuracy of data used in the calculation.\n• We evaluated the reasonableness of the methodology used by the Company to estimate the implant inventory LCNRV reserve by comparing\nactual results to the historical estimates.\n• We evaluated the key assumptions used in identifying the population of implant inventory with excess or obsolescence exposure that require a\nreserve and determining the amount of reserve to record.\n• We evaluated the appropriateness of the underlying data utilized in management’s analysis, including current implant inventory usage, product\naging, recent sales, and product life cycle.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSan Diego, California\nFebruary 27, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2021.\nF-3\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphatec Holdings, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Alphatec Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated\nfinancial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion\non those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is\nto express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSan Diego, California\nFebruary 27, 2024\nF-4\nTable of Contents\nALPHATEC HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE

of Contents\nALPHATEC HOLDINGS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\nThe Company\nAlphatec Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Alphatec Spine, Inc. (“Alphatec Spine”), SafeOp Surgical, Inc.\n(“SafeOp”), and EOS imaging S.A.S. (“EOS”), is a medical technology company focused on the design, development, and advancement of technology for the\nbetter surgical treatment of spinal disorders. The Company, headquartered in Carlsbad, California, markets its products in the United States (\"U.S.\") and\ninternationally via a network of independent sales agents and direct sales representatives.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America\n(\"U.S. GAAP\") and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company translates the financial statements of its foreign\nsubsidiaries using end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations. All\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company operates in one reportable business segment.\nPrior-year Adjustment\nSubsequent to the issuance of the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company identified\nthat a deferred tax liability and additional goodwill related to the acquisition of EOS should have been recorded at the time of the acquisition. The Company\ncorrected the errors in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of the earliest year presented and has concluded that the correction of these errors\nis not material to the previously issued financial statements.\nThe correction to the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive loss,\nconsolidated statements of stockholders' equity, and consolidated statements of cash flows are as follows (in thousands):\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nAt December 31, 2022\nConsolidated Balance Sheets As Reported Adjustment As Corrected\nGoodwill $ 39,775 7,592 $ 47,367\nTotal assets $ 513,376 7,592 $ 520,968\nOther long-term liabilities $ 11,543 5,546 $ 17,089\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss $ (10,690) (104) $ (10,794)\nAccumulated deficit $ (934,474) 2,150 $ (932,324)\nTotal stockholders' deficit $ (36,713) 2,046 $ (34,667)\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' deficit $ 513,376 7,592 $ 520,968\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Operations As Reported Adjustment As Corrected As Reported Adjustment As Corrected\nIncome tax provision (benefit) $ 140 (856) $ (716) $ 164 (1,294) $ (1,130)\nNet loss $ (152,149) 856 $ (151,293) $ (144,326) 1,294 $ (143,032)\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted $ (1.47) $ 0.01 $ (1.46) $ (1.50) $ 0.01 $ (1.49)\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss As Reported Adjustment As Corrected As Reported Adjustment As Corrected\nNet loss $ (152,149) 856 $ (151,293) $ (144,326) 1,294 $ (143,032)\nForeign currency translation adjustments $ (4,696) (62) $ (4,758) $ (7,198) (42) $ (7,240)\nComprehensive loss $ (156,845) 794 $ (156,051) $ (151,524) 1,252 $ (150,272)\nAt December 31, 2022 At December 31, 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders' (Deficit) Equity As Reported Adjustment As Corrected As Reported Adjustment As Corrected\nForeign currency translation adjustments $ (4,696) (62) $ (4,758) $ (7,198) (42) $ (7,240)\nNet loss $ (152,149) 856 $ (151,293) $ (144,326) 1,294 $ (143,032)\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss $ (10,690) (104) $ (10,794) $ (5,994) (42) $ (6,036)\nAccumulated deficit $ (934,474) 2,150 $ (932,324) $ (782,325) 1,294 $ (781,031)\nTotal stockholders' (deficit) equity $ (36,713) 2,046 $ (34,667) $ 79,422 1,252 $ 80,674\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows As Reported Adjustment As Corrected As Reported Adjustment As Corrected\nNet loss $ (152,149) 856 $ (151,293) $ (144,326) 1,294 $ (143,032)\nOther long-term liabilities $ (2,342) (847) $ (3,189) $ 4,852 (1,179) $ 3,673\nNet cash used for operating activities $ (75,143) 9 $ (75,134) $ (73,432) 115 $ (73,317)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash $ (357) (9) $ (366) $ (1,289) (115) $ (1,404)\nReclassification\nCertain financial statement line items in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 have been disaggregated to conform\nto the current year’s presentation.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the useful lives of property and equipment,\ngoodwill, intangible assets, allowances for doubtful accounts, deferred tax assets, inventory, stock-based compensation, revenues, income tax uncertainties, and\nother contingencies.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, and accounts\nreceivable. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by depositing its cash and investments with established financial institutions. Although the Company\ndeposits its cash with multiple financial institutions, its deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits.\nThe Company’s customers are primarily hospitals and surgical centers. No one single customer represented greater than 10 percent of consolidated\nrevenues and accounts receivable for the years presented. Credit to customers is granted based on an analysis of the customers’ credit worthiness. Credit losses\nhave not been significant.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the\ntime of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding\nreceivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all\nsignificant outstanding invoices. In determining the provision for invoices not specifically reviewed, the Company analyzes historical collection experience. If\nthe historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the Company’s future ability to collect outstanding receivables\nor if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments, an increase in the provision for doubtful\naccounts may be required.\nThe Company’s accounts receivable generally have net 30-day payment terms. The Company generally does not allow returns of products that have been\ndelivered. The Company offers standard quality assurance warranty on its products. The Company had no material bad debt expense during the years presented.\nExcess and Obsolete Inventory\nMost of the Company’s inventory is comprised of finished goods, which is primarily produced by third-party suppliers. Specialized implants, fixation\nproducts, and biologics are determined by utilizing a standard cost method that includes capitalized variances which approximates the weighted average cost.\nImaging equipment and related parts are valued at weighted average cost. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company\nreviews the components of its inventory on a periodic basis for excess and obsolescence and adjusts inventory to its net realizable value as necessary.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nThe Company records a lower of cost or net realizable value (“LCNRV”) inventory reserve for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon its\nexpected use of inventory on hand. The Company’s inventory, which consists primarily of specialized implants, fixation products, and biologics is at risk of\nobsolescence due to the need to maintain substantial levels of inventory. In order to market its products effectively and meet the demands of interoperative\nproduct placement, the Company maintains and provides surgeons and hospitals with a variety of inventory products and sizes. For each surgery, fewer than all\ncomponents will be consumed. The need to maintain and provide a wide variety of inventory causes inventory to be held that is not likely to be used.\nThe Company’s estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. The estimates and\nassumptions are determined primarily based on current usage of inventory and the age of inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, the Company considers\nrecent sales experience to develop assumptions about future demand for its products, while considering product life cycles and new product launches. Increases\nin the LCNRV reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding charge to cost of sales. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021, the Company recorded LCNRV charges for excess and obsolete inventory of $13.6 million, $9.8 million and $11.1 million, respectively, net of inventory\nsold of $0.2 million, $1.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a reduction of\nreserve for inventory that was disposed of $12.9 million, $8.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the related assets, generally ranging from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under financing leases are amortized\nover the shorter of their useful lives or the remaining terms of the related leases.\nOperating Lease\nThe Company determines whether a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception by assessing whether there is an identified asset and whether the\ncontract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset in exchange for consideration over a period of time. If both criteria are met, the Company\ndetermines the initial classification and measurement of its right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date and thereafter, if\nmodified. The Company recognizes a ROU asset and lease liability for its operating leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. The lease term includes any\nrenewal options and termination options that the Company is reasonably assured to exercise. ROU assets and lease liabilities are based on the present value of\nlease payments over the lease term. The present value of operating lease payments is determined by using the incremental borrowing rate of interest that the\nCompany would borrow on a collateralized basis for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\nRent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the reasonably assured lease term based on the total lease payments and is\nincluded in cost of sales, research and development, and sales, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company aggregates all lease and non-lease components for each class of underlying assets into a single lease component and variable charges for\ncommon area maintenance and other variable costs are recognized as expense as incurred. Total variable costs associated with leases were immaterial for all\nyears presented. The Company had an immaterial amount of financing leases as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, which is included in property and equipment,\nnet, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nValuation of Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from the Company’s business combinations. The determination of the\nvalue of goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations and asset acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments\nto allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is assessed for impairment using fair value\nmeasurement techniques on an annual basis or more frequently if facts and circumstance warrant such a review. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if the\nCompany determines that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its respective fair value.\nThe Company’s annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill consists of one reporting unit. The Company completed its most recent annual evaluation\nfor impairment of goodwill as of October 1, 2023 and determined that no impairment existed. In addition, no indicators of impairment were noted through\nDecember 31, 2023, and consequently no impairment charge was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nValuation of Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets are comprised primarily of purchased technology, customer relationships, trade name, trademarks, and in-process research and\ndevelopment. The Company makes significant judgments in relation to the valuation of intangible assets resulting from business combinations and asset\nacquisitions. Intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 2 to 12 years. The Company bases the useful\nlives and related amortization expense on the period of time it estimates the assets will generate net sales or otherwise be used. The Company also periodically\nreviews the lives assigned to its intangible assets to ensure that its initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which the Company\nexpects to realize cash flows. If a change were to occur in any of the above-mentioned factors or estimates, the likelihood of a material change in the Company’s\nreported results would increase. The Company evaluates its intangible assets with finite lives for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance\nrelative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of the Company’s use of the acquired assets or the strategy\nfor its overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, the\nCompany makes an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the\nintangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset over the remaining amortization period, the Company\nreduces the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period. Significant judgment is required in\nthe forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow valuation models. It is possible that plans may change and estimates used may\nprove to be inaccurate. If actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used to assess the\nrecoverability of these assets, the Company could incur additional impairment charges. There were no impairment charges during the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022 or 2021.\nIn-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") and software in development have indefinite lives and are not amortized until the related products\nreach full commercial launch or when the projects are complete and their assets are ready for their intended use. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered\nto be impaired if the products do not reach commercial launch, if the project is not completed or not completed in a timely manner, or if the related products or\nprojects are no longer technologically feasible. Impairment related to IPR&D and software in development is calculated as the excess of the asset's carrying\nvalue over its fair value. There were no impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company assesses potential impairment to its long-lived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows related to the asset are\nless than its carrying amount. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value\nand is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results. There were no material impairment charges during the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nF-16\nTable of Contents\nWarrants to Purchase Common Stock\nWarrants are accounted for in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on\nthe specific terms of the agreements. All warrants qualify for classification within stockholders' equity.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe carrying amount of financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets,\naccounts payable, accrued expenses, and short-term debt included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are reasonable estimates of fair value due\nto their short maturities.\nAuthoritative guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices\nin markets that are not active; or other inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets\nor liabilities.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards\nCodification (“ASC”) Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”). This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are\nwithin the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements, and financial instruments. Under Topic 606, an entity recognizes\nrevenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in\nexchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity\nperforms the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the\ntransaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a\nperformance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled\nto in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nSales are derived primarily from the sale of spinal implant products, imaging equipment, and related services to hospitals and medical centers through\ndirect sales representatives and independent sales agents. Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with customers are satisfied,\nwhich occurs with the transfer of control of products to customers, either upon shipment of the product or delivery of the product to the customer depending on\nthe shipping terms, or when the products are used in a surgical procedure (implanted in a patient). Revenue from the sale of imaging equipment is recognized as\neach distinct performance obligation is fulfilled and control transfers to the customer, beginning with shipment or delivery, depending on the terms. Revenue\nfrom other distinct performance obligations, such as maintenance on imaging equipment and other imaging related services, is recognized in the period the\nservice is performed, and makes up less than 10% of the Company’s total revenue. Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration expected to be\nreceived in exchange for the transfer of the goods or services specified in the contract with each customer. In certain cases, the Company does offer the ability\nfor customers to lease its imaging equipment primarily on a non-sales type basis, but such arrangements are immaterial to total revenue in the years presented.\nThe Company generally does not allow returns of products that have been delivered. Costs incurred by the Company associated with sales contracts with\ncustomers are deferred over the performance obligation period and recognized in the same period as the related revenue, except for contracts that complete\nwithin one year or less, in which case the associated costs are expensed as incurred. Payment terms for sales to customers may vary but are commensurate with\nthe general business practices in the country of sale.\nTo the extent that the transaction price includes variable consideration, such as discounts, rebates, and customer payment penalties, the Company\nestimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely\namount method depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s judgment,\nit is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Estimates of variable consideration and determination of\nwhether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company’s anticipated performance and all information\nthat is reasonably available, including historical, current, and forecasted information.\nThe Company records a contract asset when one or more performance obligations have been completed and revenue has been recognized, but the\ncustomer's payment is contingent on the satisfaction of additional performance obligations. The Company records a contract liability, or deferred revenue, when\nit has an obligation to provide a product or service to the customer and payment is received in advance of its performance. When the Company sells a product or\nservice with a future performance obligation, revenue is deferred on the unfulfilled performance obligation and recognized over the related performance period.\nGenerally, the Company does not have observable evidence of the standalone selling price related to its future service obligations; therefore, the Company\nestimates the selling price using an expected cost plus a margin approach. The transaction price is allocated using the relative standalone selling price method.\nThe use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with the design, development,\ntesting, and enhancement of the Company's products. Research and development expenses also include salaries and related employee benefits, research-related\noverhead expenses, fees paid to external service providers and development consultants in the form of both cash and equity.\nTransaction-related Expenses\nTransaction-related costs are expensed as incurred. Transaction-related expenses consist of certain costs incurred related primarily to the acquisition and\nintegration of Valence, as defined below, and EOS.\nProduct Shipment Cost\nProduct shipment costs for surgical sets are included in sales, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of\noperations. Product shipment costs totaled $17.3 million, $14.8 million and $8.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 respectively.\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense for equity-classified awards, principally related to restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance restricted stock\nunits (\"PRSUs\") is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award. The fair value of equity instruments that are expected to vest is\nrecognized and amortized over the requisite service period. The Company has granted awards with up to four year graded or cliff vesting terms. No exercise\nprice or other monetary payment is required for receipt of the shares issued in settlement of the respective award; instead, consideration is furnished in the form\nof the participant’s service.\nThe fair value of RSUs including PRSUs with pre-defined performance criteria is based on the stock price on the date of grant.\nStock-based compensation recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations is based on awards expected to ultimately vest and has been\nreduced for estimated forfeitures. The Company’s estimated forfeiture rates may differ from its actual forfeitures. The Company considers its historical\nexperience of pre-vesting forfeitures on awards by each homogenous group of employees as the basis to arrive at its estimated annual pre-vesting forfeiture\nrates.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options issued under the Company’s equity incentive plans and shares issued to employees under the\nCompany’s employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model\nincorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates. The expected volatility is based on the historical\nvolatility of the Company’s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected term of the Company’s stock options and\nESPP offering period which is derived from historical experience. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the\nU.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. The Company has never declared or paid dividends and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.\nAwards to non-employees are accounted for under the same stock-based compensation provisions as employees, which require that the fair value of\nthese instruments be recognized as an expense when earned. For Development Service Agreements, where the future payments for product and/or intellectual\nproperty rights may be paid in either cash or restricted shares of our common stock at the election of the developer, we estimate the fair value of those awards\nsimilar to a stock option, using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the date of grant. For Development Service Agreements where the future payments for\nproduct and/or intellectual property rights will be paid in restricted shares of our common stock, the fair value is based on the stock price on the date of grant.\nThe stock-based compensation expense is recognized as earned once the award is deemed probable of achieving the pre-defined performance criteria. The\nstock-based compensation expense is included in cost of sales or research and development expense on the consolidated statements of operations commensurate\nwith the nature of the services performed.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with provisions which set forth an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of\ndeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases\nof assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In making such\ndetermination, a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered, including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected\nfuture taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the income tax provision.\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nNet Loss per Share\nBasic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding for the year. If applicable, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net loss available to common\nstockholders by the diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year determined using the treasury-stock method and the if-\nconverted method for convertible debt. For purposes of this calculation, common stock subject to repurchase by the Company, common stock issuable upon\nconversion or exercise of convertible notes, preferred shares, options, and warrants are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the\ncalculation of diluted earnings per share when their effect is dilutive. Due to the Company’s net loss position, the effect of including common stock equivalents\nin the earnings per share calculation is anti-dilutive, and therefore not included.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted loss per share (in thousands, except per share data):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNumerator:\nNet loss $ (186,638) $ (151,293) $ (143,032)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 121,242 103,373 96,197\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted $ (1.54) $ (1.46) $ (1.49)\nThe following potentially dilutive shares of common stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would\nhave been anti-dilutive for the years presented (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nSeries A convertible preferred stock — — 29\nOptions to purchase common stock and employee stock purchase plan 2,555 2,991 3,416\nUnvested restricted stock units 7,713 8,533 8,703\nWarrants to purchase common stock 8,219 15,491 20,184\nSenior convertible notes 17,246 17,246 17,246\n35,733 44,261 49,578\nRecently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract\nAssets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. The guidance requires application of Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers to\nrecognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. ASU No. 2021-08 adds an exception to the general\nrecognition and measurement principle in Topic 805 where assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and\ncontract liabilities arising from contracts with customers, are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Under the new guidance, the acquirer will recognize\nacquired contract assets and contract liabilities as if the acquirer had originated the contract. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within\nthose fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2021-08 as of January 1, 2023, on a\nprospective basis. The adoption of ASU No. 2021-08 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures to enhance the transparency\nof income tax disclosures. The guidance in ASU No. 2023-09 allows for a prospective method of transition, with the option to apply the standard\nretrospectively. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not intend to\nearly adopt the standard and is in the process of assessing the impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nF-20\nTable of Contents\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures that expands\ndisclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosure of significant segment expenses. The guidance in ASU No. 2023-07\nallows for a retrospective method of transition. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods in fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not intend to early adopt the standard and is in the process of assessing\nthe impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements - Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update\nand Simplification Initiative. The guidance amends the ASC to incorporate certain disclosure requirements from SEC Release No. 33-10532 Disclosure Update\nand Simplification issued in 2018. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the Securities and Exchange Commission's removal of that\nrelated disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. ASU No. 2023-06 is not expected to have a\nmaterial impact on the Company's financial statements.\nF-21\nTable of Contents\n2. Business Combination\nThe Company recognizes assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest at fair value at the date of acquisition.\nOn April 19, 2023, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Integrity Implants Inc. and Fusion Robotics, LLC (collectively, the\n“Sellers”), whereby the Company acquired certain assets, liabilities, employees, and contracts in connection with the Sellers’ navigation-enabled robotics\nplatform (“Valence”). The Company paid the Sellers cash consideration of $55.0 million at closing, which represented the total purchase consideration. The\nacquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the Company did not acquire any material assets or assume any material liabilities in connection\nwith the acquisition, excluding intangible assets and goodwill. The acquisition is treated as an asset purchase for income tax purposes; therefore, the goodwill\nrecorded is considered deductible for income tax purposes. Refer to Note 4 for further details on intangible assets and goodwill acquired.\nThe Company is in the process of finalizing the purchase price allocation. While the Company does not expect material changes in the valuation\noutcome, certain assumptions and findings that were in place at the date of acquisition could result in changes in the purchase price allocation.\nIn May 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of EOS. The Company paid cash of $100.0 million to acquire 100% of all issued and outstanding\nordinary shares and 57% of the outstanding convertible bonds of EOS (\"OCEANEs\").\n3.

Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nContract assets are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Contract assets relate to contracts with\ncustomers for which one or more performance obligations have been completed and revenue has been recognized, but the customer's payment is contingent on\nthe satisfaction of additional performance obligations. The opening and closing balances of the Company's contract assets are as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nContract assets $ 3,865 $ —\nThe Company had current and non-current contract liabilities totaling $13.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The\nCompany had current and non-current contract liabilities totaling $12.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. The non-current\ncontract liabilities balance is included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Contract liabilities relates to contracts with customers for\nwhich partial or complete payment of the transaction price has been received from the customer and the related obligations must be completed before revenue\ncan be recognized. These amounts primarily relate to undelivered equipment, services, or maintenance agreements. The Company recognized $28.2 million of\nrevenue from its contract liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2023, of which $10.9 million was recognized from the beginning contract liabilities\nbalance. The Company recognized $21.6 million of revenue from its contract liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2022, of which $12.9 million was\nrecognized from the beginning contract liabilities balance.

Debt\nTerm Loan\nOn January 6, 2023, the Company entered into a $150.0 million term loan credit facility with Braidwell Transaction Holdings, LLC (the “Braidwell\nTerm Loan”). The Braidwell Term Loan provides for an initial term loan of $100.0 million which was funded on the closing date. On September 28, 2023, the\nCompany drew an additional $50.0 million (the “delayed draw term loan(s)” or the “DDTL”). The Braidwell Term Loan matures on January 6, 2028. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the outstanding balance under the Braidwell Term Loan was $150.0 million.\nIn conjunction with the issuance of the Braidwell Term Loan, the Company incurred $3.4 million in debt issuance costs and $1.5 million in commitment\nfees. Commitment fees paid to the lender were accounted for as a debt discount. The debt issuance costs and debt discount were recorded as a direct reduction\nof the carrying amount of the loan on the consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized over the life of the loan. As of December 31, 2023, debt issuance\ncosts and debt discount, net of accumulated amortization, associated with the Braidwell Term Loan were $3.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nF-26\nTable of Contents\nBorrowings under the Braidwell Term Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate for such SOFR\nbusiness day (\"SOFR\") subject to a 3% floor, plus 5.75%. The applicable interest rate as of December 31, 2023 was 11.2%. The loan agreement includes an\nundrawn commitment fee, which is calculated as 1% per annum of the average daily undrawn portion of the DDTL. Interest and undrawn commitment fees\nincurred are due quarterly. The Company is also required to pay fees on any prepayment of the Braidwell Term Loan, ranging from 1.0% to 3.0% depending on\nthe date of prepayment, and a final payment fee equal to 3.25% of the principal amount of the loans drawn. The effective interest rate as of December 31, 2023\nwas 12.2%. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized interest expense on the Braidwell Term Loan of $13.2 million, which includes\n$0.4 million for the amortization of debt issuance costs and $0.2 million for the debt discount. Upon the Braidwell Term Loan’s maturity, any outstanding\nprincipal balance, unpaid accrued interest, and all other obligations under the Braidwell Term Loan will be due and payable.\nThe Braidwell Term Loan is secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets with the priority interest of the lenders in the Braidwell Term Loan and\nthe Revolving Credit Facility, as defined below, subject to terms of a customary intercreditor agreement, which provides that the lenders under the Revolving\nCredit Facility have a priority with respect to the Company's accounts receivable, inventory, medical instruments, and items related to the foregoing, and the\nlenders under the Braidwell Term Loan have priority with respect to the remainder of the Company's assets. The loan agreement contains customary\nrepresentations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. Under the loan agreement, the Company is required to maintain a minimum level of\nliquidity. The loan agreement also includes certain events of default, and upon the occurrence of such events of default, all outstanding loans under the\nBraidwell Term Loan may be accelerated and/or the lenders’ commitments terminated. The Company is in compliance with all required financial covenants as\nof December 31, 2023.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nIn September 2022, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with entities affiliated with MidCap Financial\nTrust (“MidCap”). The Revolving Credit Facility provides up to $50.0 million in borrowing capacity to the Company based on a borrowing base. The\nborrowing base is calculated based on certain accounts receivable and inventory assets. The Company may request a $25.0 million increase in the Revolving\nCredit Facility for a total commitment of up to $75.0 million. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of September 29, 2027, or 90 days prior to\nthe final maturity date of the Company’s 2026 Notes, as defined below. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility\nwas $49.7 million. In January 2024, the Company repaid $42.0 million of the outstanding balance.\nIn conjunction with obtaining the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company incurred $1.4 million in debt issuance costs. These costs were capitalized to\nother assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized over the life of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31 2023, and 2022, debt\nissuance costs, net of accumulated amortization, associated with the Revolving Credit Facility were $1.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nThe outstanding loans bear interest at the sum of SOFR plus 3.5% per annum. The interest rate as of December 31, 2023 was 9.0%. The loan agreements\ninclude an unused line fee, which is calculated as 0.5% per annum of either the unused Revolving Credit Facility or a minimum balance. Interest and unused\nline fees incurred are due and capitalized to the outstanding principal balance monthly. The Company recognized interest expense on the Revolving Credit\nFacility of $2.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, which includes $0.3 million for the amortization of debt issuance costs. The Company\nrecognized interest expense on the Revolving Credit Facility of $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, which includes $0.1 million for the\namortization of debt issuance costs. Upon the Revolving Credit Facility’s maturity, any outstanding principal balance, unpaid accrued interest, and all other\nobligations under the Revolving Credit Facility will be due and payable.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains a lockbox arrangement clause requiring the Company to maintain a lockbox bank account. If the revolving loan\navailability is less than 30% of the revolving loan limit for five consecutive business days, or the Company is in default, MidCap will apply funds collected\nfrom the Company's lockbox account to reduce the outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's loan\navailability level has not activated lockbox deductions, nor is it expected to for the next 12 months; therefore, the Company has determined that the outstanding\nbalance under the Revolving Credit Facility is long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets.\nF-27\nTable of Contents\nThe outstanding loans are secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets with the priority interest of the lenders subject to terms of a customary\nintercreditor agreement in connection with the Braidwell Term Loan. The loan agreements and other ancillary documents contain customary representations and\nwarranties and affirmative and negative covenants. Under the loan agreements, the Company is required to maintain a minimum level of liquidity. The loan\nagreements also include certain events of default, and upon the occurrence of such events of default, all outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility\nmay be accelerated and/or the lenders’ commitments terminated. The Company is in compliance with all required financial covenants as of December 31, 2023.\n0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026\nIn August 2021, the Company issued $316.3 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 2026 Notes with a stated interest rate of 0.75% and a\nmaturity date of August 1, 2026. Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February\n1, 2022. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2026 Notes were approximately $306.2 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ offering expenses and\nbefore cash used for the privately negotiated capped call transactions (the \"Capped Call Transactions\"), as described below, the repurchase of stock, as described\nin Note 9, and the repayment of the outstanding unsecured term loan with Squadron Medical Finance Solutions, LLC (the “Squadron Medical Term Loan\") and\noutstanding obligation under the Inventory Financing Agreement, as described below. The 2026 Notes do not contain any financial covenants.\nThe 2026 Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock based upon an initial conversion rate of 54.5316 shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $18.34 per share). The conversion rate\nwill be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including certain distributions and dividends to all or substantially all of the\nholders of the Company’s common stock. Based on the terms of the 2026 Notes, when a conversion notice is received, the Company has the option to pay or\ndeliver cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination thereof.\nHolders of the 2026 Notes have the right to convert their notes in certain circumstances and during specified periods. Prior to the close of business on the\nbusiness day immediately preceding February 2, 2026, holders may convert all or a portion of their 2026 Notes only under the following circumstances: (1)\nduring any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2021, if the last reported\nsale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on,\nand including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable\ntrading day; (2) during the 5 consecutive business days immediately after any 10 consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the\ntrading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported\nsale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. From and\nafter February 2, 2026, holders of the 2026 Notes may convert their notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading\nday immediately before the maturity date. As of December 31, 2023, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2026 Notes to convert have been met.\nThe 2026 Notes are classified as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe 2026 Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after August 6, 2024 and on or\nbefore the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be\nredeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the\nconversion price for a specified period of time. In addition, calling any of the notes for redemption will constitute a “make-whole fundamental change” with\nrespect to that note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that note will be increased in certain circumstances if such note is\nconverted after it is called for redemption.\nIf a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their 2026 Notes for cash at\na price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. No principal payments are otherwise due on the 2026 Notes\nprior to maturity.\nF-28\nTable of Contents\nThe Company recorded the full principal amount of the 2026 Notes as a long-term liability net of deferred issuance costs. The annual effective interest\nrate for the 2026 Notes is 1.4%. The Company recognized interest expense on the 2026 Notes of $4.4 million, $4.4 million and $1.7 million during the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which includes $2.0 million, $2.0 million and $0.8 million for the amortization of debt issuance costs\nduring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company uses the if-converted method for assumed conversion of the 2026 Notes\nto compute the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for diluted earnings per share, if applicable.\nThe outstanding principal amount and carrying value of the 2026 Notes consist of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023\nPrincipal $ 316,250\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (5,293)\nNet carrying value $ 310,957\nCapped Call Transactions\nIn connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, the Company entered into the Capped Call Transactions with certain financial institutions. The\nCapped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution and/or offset the cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of\nthe principal amount of the 2026 Notes upon conversion of the 2026 Notes in the event that the market price per share of the Company’s common stock is\ngreater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The Capped Call Transactions have an initial cap\nprice of $27.68 per share of the Company’s common stock, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of the Company’s common\nstock on August 5, 2021, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. Collectively, the Capped Call Transactions\ncover, initially, the number of shares of the Company’s common stock underlying the 2026 Notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to\nthose applicable to the 2026 Notes. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was approximately $39.9 million.\nThe Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the 2026 Notes and will not affect any holder’s rights under the\nnotes. Holders of the 2026 Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Capped Call Transactions.\nThe Capped Call Transactions meet all of the applicable criteria for equity classification and, as a result, the related $39.9 million cost was recorded as a\nreduction to additional paid-in capital on the Company’s consolidated statements of shareholders’ (deficit) equity for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOCEANE Convertible Bonds\nOn May 31, 2018, EOS issued 4,344,651 OCEANEs denominated in Euros, due May 2023 for aggregate gross proceeds of $34.3 million. The\nOCEANEs were unsecured obligations of EOS, ranked equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of EOS, and paid interest at a rate equal\nto 6% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 31 and November 30 of each year, beginning November 30, 2018. The OCEANEs matured on May 31,\n2023 and the outstanding OCEANEs and accrued interest were paid in full on May 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, no OCEANEs remained outstanding.\nInterest expense was $0.3 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $0.7 million from the date of the EOS\nacquisition to December 31, 2021.\nF-29\nTable of Contents\nOther Debt Agreements\nThe Company has two loan agreements under French government sponsored COVID-19 relief initiatives (“PGE” loans). Each PGE loan initially\ncontained a 12-month term, with an option to extend, and 90% of the principal balance of each loan is state guaranteed. The cost of the state guaranty is 0.25%\nof the loan amounts. The commercial banks loan of $3.6 million is interest free and the lenders loan of $1.6 million bears interest of 1.75%. The loan capital and\nloan guaranty costs are payable in full at the end of the 12-month term or the loan may be extended up to 5 additional years.\nIn February 2022, the Company extended the maturity for each loan agreement to 2027. Each loan has a 12-month period from the applicable extension\ndate where interest only payments will occur (the “Interest Only Period”). Following the Interest Only Period, monthly and quarterly installments of principal\nand interest under each loan agreement is due until the original principal amounts and applicable interest is fully repaid in 2027. The outstanding obligation\nunder each loan as of December 31, 2023 was $3.1 million and $1.4 million at weighted average interest rates of 0.98% and 1.25%, respectively, and weighted\naverage costs of the state guaranty of 0.69% and 1.00%, respectively.\nDebt consists of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n2026 Notes $ 316,250 $ 316,250\nOCEANEs — 13,333\nOther notes payable 1,175 1,869\nEOS PGE Loans 4,537 5,046\nBraidwell Term Loan, including final payment fee of $4,875 154,875 —\nRevolving Credit Facility 49,720 35,251\nTotal 526,557 371,749\nLess: unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs (13,714) (7,290)\nTotal 512,843 364,459\nLess: short-term debt (1,808) (14,948)\nTotal long-term debt $ 511,035 $ 349,511\nPrincipal payments on debt are as follows as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\n2024 $ 1,804\n2025 1,733\n2026 317,802\n2027 50,343\n2028 154,875\nTotal 526,557\nLess: unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs (13,714)\nTotal 512,843\nLess: short-term debt (1,808)\nLong-term debt $ 511,035\nPaycheck Protection Loan\nOn April 23, 2020, the Company received the proceeds from a loan in the amount of $4.3 million (the “PPP Loan”) from Silicon Valley Bank, as lender,\npursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. The Company used the loan proceeds for\npurposes consistent with the terms of the PPP and applied for forgiveness of the entire $4.3 million loan balance, which was granted in July 2021. The Company\nrecorded a gain on debt extinguishment of $4.3 million, which is included in loss on debt extinguishment, net, on the consolidated statements of operations for\nthe year ended December 31, 2021.\nF-30\nTable of Contents\nSquadron Medical Credit Agreement\nOn November 6, 2018, the Company entered into the Squadron Medical Term Loan that was subsequently amended in March 2019, May 2020 and\nDecember 2020 to expand the availability of additional term loans, extend the maturity, remove all financial covenant requirements and, in the December 2020\namendment, incorporate a debt exchange. In December 2020, the Company amended the Squadron Medical Term Loan to expand the credit facility by an\nadditional $15.0 million and to extend the maturity of the Squadron Medical Term Loan to June 30, 2026. In conjunction with the Squadron Medical Term Loan\namendment in December 2020, the Company entered into a debt exchange agreement whereby the Company exchanged $30.0 million of the Company’s\noutstanding debt obligations under the Squadron Medical Term Loan for the issuance of 2,700,270 shares of the Company’s Common Stock to Squadron Capital\nLLC and a participant lender, based on a price of $11.11 per share. The debt exchange resulted in additional debt issuance costs of $3.8 million calculated as the\ndifference between the Company’s stock price on the date of issuance and the issuance price.\nThe Company accounted for the March 2019, May 2020, and December 2020 amendments of the Squadron Medical Term Loan as debt modifications\nwith continued amortization of the existing and inclusion of the new debt issuance costs amortized into interest expense utilizing the effective interest rate\nmethod. The Company determined that the $30.0 million pre-payment associated with the December 2020 amendment should be accounted for as a partial\nextinguishment of the November 6, 2018 Squadron Medical Term Loan, as amended. As a result of the partial extinguishment the Company elected, as an\naccounting policy in accordance with ASC 470-50-40-2, to write off a proportionate amount of the unamortized fees at the time that the financing was partially\nsettled in accordance with the terms of the Squadron Medical Term Loan. The unamortized debt issuance costs were allocated between the remaining original\nloan balance and the portion of the loan paid down on a pro-rata basis. At the time of prepayment, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of $6.1\nmillion, which was included in loss on debt extinguishment, net, on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and\ncapitalized $3.8 million in non-cash debt issuance closing costs.\nOn August 10, 2021, the Company terminated and repaid all obligations under the Squadron Medical Term Loan, which consisted of the $45.0 million\noutstanding principal and $0.2 million accrued interest. As a result of the early termination of the Squadron Medical Term Loan, the Company recorded a loss\non debt extinguishment associated with the unamortized debt issuance costs of $11.7 million, which is included in loss on debt extinguishment, net, on the\nconsolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn connection with the initial 2018 Squadron Medical Term Loan and subsequent amendments, the Company issued an aggregate of 6,759,530 warrants\nto Squadron Medical and a participant lender. See Note 9 for further information on the warrants issued.\n7. Commitments and Contingencies\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception by assessing whether there is an identified asset and whether the contract conveys the\nright to control the use of the identified asset in exchange for consideration over a period of time. If both criteria are met, the Company records the associated\nlease liability and corresponding ROU asset upon commencement of the lease using a discount rate based the incremental borrowing rate of interest that the\nCompany would borrow on a collateralized basis for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Any short-term leases defined\nas twelve months or less or month-to-month leases are excluded and continue to be expensed each month. Total costs associated with these short-term leases is\nimmaterial to all years presented.\nF-31\nTable of Contents\nThe Company leases office and storage facilities and equipment under various operating and financing lease agreements. The initial terms of these leases\nrange from 1 to 10 years and generally provide for periodic rent increases. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material variable lease\npayments, residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company aggregates all lease and non-lease components for each class of underlying\nassets into a single lease component and variable charges for common area maintenance and other variable costs are recognized as expense as incurred. Total\nvariable costs associated with leases for the year ended December 31, 2023 were immaterial. The Company had an immaterial amount of financing leases as of\nDecember 31, 2023, which is included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities, on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company occupies 121,541 square feet of office space as its headquarters in Carlsbad, California. On December 4, 2019, the Company entered into\na 10-year operating lease that commenced on February 1, 2021 and will terminate on January 31, 2031, subject to two sixty-month options to renew which are\nnot reasonably certain to be exercised. Base rent under the building lease increases annually by 3% throughout the remainder of the lease. On May 11, 2022, the\nCompany entered into a lease amendment for the build out of additional space within the building which resulted in a lease modification increasing the ROU\nasset and lease liability.\nFuture minimum annual lease payments for all operating leases of the Company are as follows as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\n2024 $ 5,505\n2025 5,246\n2026 5,187\n2027 5,175\n2028 4,514\nThereafter 8,582\nTotal undiscounted lease payments 34,209\nLess: imputed interest (5,373)\nOperating lease liability 28,836\nLess: current portion of operating lease liability (5,159)\nOperating lease liability, less current portion $ 23,677\nThe Company’s weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as\nfollows:\n(cid:0)(cid:3)\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nWeighted average remaining lease term (years) 6.5 7.7\nWeighted average discount rate 5.5% 5.5%\nInformation related to the Company’s operating leases is as follows (in thousands):\n(cid:0)(cid:3)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRent expense $ 5,045 $ 4,643 $ 4,482\nCash paid for amounts included in measurement of lease liabilities $ 5,120 $ 4,409 $ 1,795\nPurchase Commitments\nThe Company is obligated to certain minimum inventory purchase commitment requirements with a third-party supplier through December 2026. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the remaining minimum purchase commitment required by the Company under the agreement was $13.9 million.\nF-32\nTable of Contents\nLitigation\nThe Company is and may become involved in various legal proceedings arising from its business activities. While management is not aware of any\nlitigation matter that in and of itself would have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position,\nlitigation is inherently unpredictable, and depending on the nature and timing of a proceeding, an unfavorable resolution could materially affect the Company’s\nfuture consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular year. The Company assesses contingencies to determine the degree of\nprobability and range of possible loss for potential accrual or disclosure in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is\naccrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably\nestimated. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires\njudgments about future events. When evaluating contingencies, the Company may be unable to provide a meaningful estimate due to a number of factors,\nincluding the procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of\ninformation important to the matters. In addition, damage amounts claimed in litigation against the Company may be unsupported, exaggerated or unrelated to\nreasonably possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of the Company’s potential liability.\nIn February 2018, NuVasive, Inc. filed suit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (NuVasive,\nInc. v. Alphatec Holdings, Inc. et al., Case No. 3:18-cv-00347-CAB-MDD (S.D. Cal.)), alleging that certain of the Company’s products, infringed, or\ncontributed to the infringement of, U.S. Patent Nos. 7,819,801, 8,355,780, 8,361,156, 8,439,832, 8,753,270, 9,833,227 and U.S. Design Patent Nos. D652,519\nand D750,252. In June 2022, the parties reached a final resolution of all matters and executed a confidential settlement agreement. The Court dismissed the\naction with prejudice. The outcome of these proceedings did not have any material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash\nflows or financial position.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements under which it occasionally indemnifies third-parties for intellectual property\ninfringement claims or claims arising from breaches of representations or warranties. In addition, from time to time, the Company provides indemnity\nprotection to third-parties for claims relating to past performance arising from undisclosed liabilities, product liabilities, environmental obligations,\nrepresentations and warranties, and other claims. In these agreements, the scope and amount of remedy, or the period in which claims can be made, may be\nlimited. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, due under these indemnities due to the conditional nature of\nthe obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each agreement.\nIn October 2017, NuVasive filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court against Mr. Miles, the Company’s Chairman and CEO, who was a former officer\nand board member of NuVasive. The Company itself was not initially a named defendant in this lawsuit; however, in June 2018, NuVasive amended its\ncomplaint to add the Company as a defendant. In October 2018, the Delaware Court ordered that NuVasive advance legal fees for Mr. Miles’ defense in the\nlawsuit, as well as Mr. Miles’ legal fees incurred in pursuing advancement of his fees, pursuant to an indemnification agreement between NuVasive and Mr.\nMiles.\nRoyalties\nThe Company has entered into various intellectual property agreements requiring the payment of royalties based on the sale of products that utilize such\nintellectual property. These royalties primarily relate to products sold by Alphatec Spine and are based on fixed fees or calculated either as a percentage of net\nsales or on a per-unit sold basis. Royalties are included on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a component of cost of sales.\nF-33\nTable of Contents\n8. Orthotec Settlement\nOn September 26, 2014, the Company entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement, dated as of August 13, 2014, by and among the Company and\nits direct subsidiaries, including Alphatec Spine, Inc., Alphatec Holdings International C.V., Scient'x S.A.S. and Surgiview S.A.S.; HealthpointCapital, LLC,\nHealthpointCapital Partners, L.P., HealthpointCapital Partners II, L.P., John H. Foster and Mortimer Berkowitz III; and Orthotec, LLC and Patrick Bertranou,\n(the “Settlement Agreement”). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Orthotec, LLC $49.0 million in cash, including initial cash\npayments totaling $1.75 million, which the Company paid in March 2014, and an additional lump sum payment of $15.75 million, which the Company paid in\nApril 2014. The Company agreed to pay the remaining $31.5 million in 28 quarterly installments of $1.1 million and one additional quarterly installment of\n$0.7 million, commencing October 1, 2014. The unpaid balance of the principal amount due accrued interest at the rate of 7% per year until paid in full. The\naccrued but unpaid interest was paid in quarterly installments of $1.1 million (or the full amount of the accrued but unpaid interest if less than $1.1 million)\nfollowing the full payment of the $31.5 million in quarterly installments.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has paid all installment payments due, including imputed interest, under the Settlement Agreement and no\nbalance remains outstanding.\n9.

As of December 31, 2023, and\n2022, the redeemable preferred stock carrying value was $23.6 million and there were 20 million shares of redeemable preferred stock authorized. The\nredeemable preferred stock is not convertible into common stock but is redeemable at $9.00 per share, (i) upon the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up, or the occurrence of certain mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, before any payment to the holders of\nthe Company’s common stock, or (ii) at the Company’s option at any time.

On June 14, 2023, the Company’s shareholders approved a third amendment to the ESPP which increased the\nnumber of shares of common stock available for purchase under the ESPP by 1,500,000 shares, resulting in total common stock reserved for issuance under the\nESPP of 3,637,449 shares. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 1,243,000 shares were available under the ESPP for future issuance.\nThe ESPP provides eligible employees with a means of acquiring equity in the Company at a discounted purchase price using their own accumulated\npayroll deductions. Under the terms of the ESPP, employees can elect to have up to 20% of their annual compensation, up to a maximum of $21,250 per year,\nwithheld to purchase shares of Company common stock for a purchase price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value per share (at closing) of\nCompany common stock on (i) the commencement date of the six-month offering period or (ii) the respective purchase date.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 there were approximately 375,000, 429,000 and 227,000 shares of common stock, issued\nunder the ESPP, respectively.

As of December 31, 2023, a valuation allowance of $211.5 million has been established against the deferred\ntax assets, as the Company has determined that it is currently not likely that these assets will be realized. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021, the valuation allowance increased by $43.6 million, $39.4 million and $41.0 million, respectively.\nIn determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of\ndeferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Based on the review of all positive and\nnegative evidence, including a three-year cumulative pretax loss, the Company determined that a full valuation allowance should be recorded against its\ndeferred tax assets, with the exception of the net indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities and the Company’s Texas Temporary Credit for Business Loss\nCarryforwards.\nThe following table summarizes the changes to unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nUnrecognized tax benefit at the beginning of the year $ 6,079 $ 15,165 $ 2,452\nIncreases in tax positions for current year relating to\nacquisitions — — 12,713\nIncreases in tax positions for prior years 1,632 — —\nDecreases in tax positions for prior years — (8,929) —\nIncreases in tax positions for current year relating to ongoing operations 1,435 173 —\nDecreases in tax positions as a result of a lapse of statute of limitations (81) (330) —\nUnrecognized tax benefits at the end of the year $ 9,065 $ 6,079 $ 15,165\nF-41\nTable of Contents\nAt December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, $8.6 million, $5.6 million and $14.5 million, respectively, of the Company’s total unrecognized tax benefits, if\nrecognized, would impact the effective income tax rate.\nIn accordance with the disclosure requirements as described in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, the Company classifies uncertain tax positions as non-\ncurrent income tax liabilities unless they are expected to be paid within one year. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters\nas a component of the income tax provision. As of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, there were $0.1 million, $0.04 million and $0.2 million in accrued\ninterest and penalties, respectively.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions,\nthe Company is no longer subject to income tax examination by tax authorities in major jurisdictions for years prior to 2019. However, to the extent allowed by\nlaw, the taxing authorities may have the right to examine prior periods where net operating losses and tax credits were generated and carried forward and make\nadjustments up to the amount of the carryforwards. The Company is not currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service, foreign or state and local\ntax authorities.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $567.3 million, $448.3 million and $117.7\nmillion, respectively. Federal and state net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 of $437.4 million and $95.4 million, respectively, can be carried\nforward indefinitely. The remaining federal and state net operating losses begin expiring at various dates beginning in 2024 through 2043, while foreign net\noperating losses in France carryforward indefinitely. At December 31, 2023, the Company had federal and state research and development tax credit\ncarryforwards of $5.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively. The federal research and development tax credits begin expiring in 2042 and the state research and\ndevelopment tax credits do not have an expiration date and may be carried forward indefinitely. At December 31, 2023, the Company also had interest expense\ncarryovers of $67.2 million which can be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may become subject to\nannual limitations due to ownership change limitations that could occur in the future as provided by Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,\nas amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), as well as similar state provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of the net operating loss and tax\ncredit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income if the Company experiences a cumulative change in ownership of more than\n50% within a three-year testing period. The Company completed formal study through the year ended December 31, 2018 and determined ownership changes\nwithin the meaning of IRC Section 382 had occurred. The Company adjusted federal tax attribute carry forwards and deferred tax assets accordingly. The\nCompany will make adjustments to the fully reserved attributes as further studies are completed.\nF-42\nTable of Contents\n12.

Miles\nName: Patrick S. Miles\nIts: Chief Executive Officer, President & Chairman\nExhibit 19\nALPHATEC HOLDINGS, INC.\nInsider Trading Policy\n(Updated and Effective as of February 12, 2019)\nI. PURPOSE\nIt is illegal for any director, officer, employee or consultant of Alphatec Holdings, Inc. or its affiliates and/or subsidiary\ncompanies (collectively, “ATEC” or the “Company”), or their Related Persons (as defined below), to trade or otherwise engage in\nany transactions involving ATEC securities while in possession of material, non-public information concerning the Company. It is\nalso illegal for any director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company to give (i.e., “tip” or “leak”) material, non-public\ninformation concerning the Company to others who may then trade or transact on the basis of that information. The U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission (“SEC”) takes insider trading very seriously and devotes significant resources to uncovering the activity\nand prosecuting offenders. Accordingly, the Company has adopted this insider trading policy (the “Policy Statement”) regarding\ntrading by Insiders (as defined below) in an effort to:\n1. assist in compliance with federal and state securities laws and SEC regulations;\n2. educate all Company personnel;\n3. set forth proper guidelines for courses of action;\n4. protect the Company and its personnel against legal liability;\n5. prevent the appearance of improper trading or tipping; and\n6. preserve the reputation of the Company and its personnel for integrity and ethical conduct.\nThis Policy Statement replaces any prior policies and procedures governing securities trading by Insiders which may have\nbeen in place prior to the adoption of this Policy Statement.\nII. SCOPE\nThis Policy Statement covers all directors, officers, employees and consultants of ATEC who receives or has access to\nmaterial, non-public information regarding the Company. The restrictions on these Company personnel also applies to their children,\ngrandchildren, parents, grandparents, spouses and siblings who reside in their households, as well as entities (such as corporations,\ntrusts and partnerships) over which any such person has or shares voting or investment control (such related persons and entities are\ncollectively referred to herein as “Related Persons”). Therefore, any trading in the Company securities by such Related Persons while\nthey are in possession of material, non-public information also may violate insider trading laws and regulations and this Policy\nStatement. As such, all Company personnel are responsible for ensuring compliance by their Related Persons. The Company’s\ndirectors, officers, employees and consultants, together with their Related Persons, collectively are referred to in this Policy\nStatement as “Insiders.”\nThis Policy Statement generally applies to any and all transactions in the Company’s securities, including shares of its\ncommon stock, options to purchase common stock, any other type of securities, such as restricted stock units, preferred stock,\nconvertible debentures, warrants, other derivative securities, and puts, calls and short sales involving the Company whether or not\nissued by the Company (such as exchange-traded put and call options). In addition, this Policy Statement generally applies to any and\nall transactions by an Insider in the securities of any other public company while the Insider is in possession of material, non-public\ninformation concerning that company, which information was obtained during the course of the Insider’s employment or affiliation\nwith ATEC.\nIII. STATEMENT OF COMPANY POLICY\nA. Restrictions Applicable to All Insiders\n1. Prohibition on Trading in ATEC Securities While in Possession of Material, Non-Public Information\nIt is the Company’s policy that Insiders may not buy or sell ATEC securities, either directly or indirectly, while aware of\nmaterial, non-public information or engage in any other action to take advantage of, or pass on (i.e., “tip” or “leak”) to others, that\ninformation. This Policy Statement also applies with equal force to information relating to any other company, including our\ncustomers, suppliers or competitors, obtained by ATEC personnel during the course of their service or employment with the\nCompany. It does not matter if there is an independent, justifiable reason for a purchase or sale, or if the Company’s “trading\nwindow,” as discussed below, otherwise is open.\na) Material, Non-Public Information\nInformation about ATEC is “material” if a reasonable investor would consider it important or significant in a decision to buy,\nsell, or hold securities, or if the disclosure of the information would be expected to significantly alter the total mix of the information\nin the marketplace about the Company. In other words, material information is any type of information that, if publicly known, could\nreasonably be expected to affect the market price of the Company’s securities or a person’s decision to buy, sell or hold the\nCompany’s securities. Both positive and negative information may be material.\nWhile it is not possible to identify all information that may be deemed “material,” the following illustrative types of\ninformation are particularly sensitive and, as a general rule, should always be considered material:\n• quarterly or annual earnings results;\n• earnings, losses or projections of future results;\n• news of a pending or proposed merger, acquisition, tender offer or important financing transaction;\n• internal financial information which departs from what the market would expect;\n• changes in dividend policies or the offering of additional securities or stock splits;\n• impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems;\n2\n• changes in management or the board;\n• significant new products or discoveries;\n• significant clinical, regulatory, manufacturing or operational developments;\n• adverse product reports;\n• actual or threatened litigation, investigations or regulatory inquiries; and\n• the gain or loss of a major contract, distributor, license or collaboration.\nMaterial information is “non-public” if it has not been widely disseminated to the public through major newswire services,\nnational news services and financial services or if the investing public has not had time to absorb the information fully. For the\npurposes of this Policy Statement, information will be considered public, i.e., no longer “non-public,” starting on the beginning of the\nsecond business day after the information has been released. Thus, if an announcement is made on a Monday, Wednesday generally\nwould be the first day on which Insiders may trade. If an announcement is made on a Friday, Tuesday generally would be the first\nday for Insiders to trade. If, however, the information released is complex (such as a prospective major financing or other\ntransaction), it may be necessary to allow additional time for the information to be absorbed by investors. In such circumstances,\nInsiders will be informed by the Policy Administrator regarding a suitable waiting period before trading.\nb) Tipping of Material, Non-Public Information to Others\nWhether the information is proprietary information about the Company or information that could have an impact on the\nCompany’s stock price (i.e., it is “material”), Insiders must not pass the information on to others. The penalties and consequences for\nillegal insider trading described herein apply to all Insiders who tip information to others, whether or not the Insider trades or derives\nany benefit from the other person’s actions. That is, Insiders can be liable for both trading on material, non-public information and for\ndisclosing that information to others who trade. As inside information is often disclosed inadvertently or overheard in casual, social\nconversations, great care must be taken to avoid such disclosures. Company personnel should not discuss internal company matters\nor developments with anyone outside of the company, except as required in the performance of regular corporate duties. Inquiries\nabout the Company made by the financial press, investment analysts or others in the financial community should be directed to the\nappropriately designated officer. Unless expressly authorized to the contrary, Company personnel should decline to comment on any\ninquiries of this nature and refer the inquirer to the Company’s authorized spokespersons or to the Policy Administrator.\nAll Company personnel should take steps, where appropriate, to prevent persons under their supervision and/or control from\nusing inside information for trading purposes. Potential insider trading violations must be immediately reported to the Policy\nAdministrator.\n2. Short-Term or Speculative Transactions\nInsiders should not engage in any of the following activities with respect to the Company’s securities:\n• short sales of the Company’s securities;\n3\n• use of the Company’s securities to secure a margin or other loan, except in limited cases with the prior approval of\nthe Policy Administrator;\n• transactions in straddles, collars, or other similar risk reduction devices, except in limited cases with the prior\napproval of the Policy Administrator; and\n• transactions in publicly-traded options relating to the Company’s securities (i.e., options that are not granted by\nthe Company), except in limited cases with the prior approval of the Policy Administrator.\n3. Prohibitions on Trading in Other Companies’ Securities While in Possession of Material, Non-Public\nInformation\nIt is common for the Company in the normal course of its business to interact with other public companies — those\ninteractions or information concerning these other public companies may be material and accordingly, Insiders must comply with the\nfollowing rules:\n• insiders may not engage in transactions involving the securities of any other public company while possessing\nmaterial, non-public information concerning that company which was obtained during the course of employment\nwith ATEC;\n• insiders may not “tip” or disclose material, non-public information concerning any other public company to\nanyone; and\n• insiders may not give trading advice of any kind to anyone concerning any other public company while possessing\nmaterial, non-public information about that company.\nB. Additional Restrictions Applicable to Certain Insiders\n1. Company Trading Window\nWhile it is never permissible to trade based on material, non-public information, to help prevent inadvertent violations and\navoid even the appearance of an improper transaction, certain Restricted Insiders (as defined below) may only engage in transactions\nin the Company’s securities during an open Trading Window (as defined below), unless excepted herein.\na) Restricted Insiders\nUnder this Policy Statement, “Restricted Insiders” shall mean Insiders who are members of the Company’s Board of\nDirectors, executive officers and other persons subject to Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(“Exchange Act”) plus certain employees, that may be identified by the Policy Administrator from time to time, who are reasonably\nexpected to be in possession of material, non-public information about the Company, such as Vice Presidents and certain members of the\nlegal and finance departments. The Company will promptly notify orally or in writing each Insider designated a Restricted Insider.\n4\nb) Open and Close of Trading Window for Restricted Insiders\nUnder this Policy Statement, the “Trading Window” shall commence (i.e., open) at the beginning of the second business day\nafter the release of the Company’s quarterly or annual financial results and will end at the beginning of the day that is two weeks\nprior to the close of each fiscal quarter or fiscal year end.\nTrading in the Company’s securities during an open Trading Window should not be considered a “safe harbor,” and all\nInsiders should use good judgment at all times to make sure that trades are not effected while in possession of material, non-\npublic information concerning the Company.\n2. Company Imposed Blackout Periods\nThe Company may also, from time to time, prohibit all or certain Insiders from trading because of developments known to\nthe Company and not yet disclosed to the public. In such instances, no designated Insider may engage in transactions involving\nCompany securities during any such special blackout periods that the Policy Administrator may designate. A Company- imposed\nspecial blackout period may result in the Trading Window detailed above not being opened and available for trading and the blackout\nperiods may be imposed for varying groups of Insiders (whether defined as “Insiders” or “Restricted Insiders” under this Policy\nStatement). No Insider may disclose to any outside third party that a special blackout period has been designated.\nC. Exceptions to Prohibitions on Trading and Transactions\n1. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nNotwithstanding the restrictions and prohibitions on trading in the Company securities as set forth in this Policy Statement,\nInsiders are permitted to effect transactions in Company securities pursuant to approved trading plans established under Rule 10b5-1\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (a “Qualified Rule 10b5-1 Plan”). A Qualified Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be validly\nestablished in compliance with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and must satisfy a number of other specific criteria. Any person who\nwishes to implement, amend or terminate a Qualified Rule 10b5-1 plan must first have the plan (or any amendment or proposal to\nterminate) pre- approved by the Policy Administrator. In pre-clearing the implementation, amendment or termination of a Qualified\nRule 10b5-1 Plan, the Policy Administrator shall not be responsible for determining whether such plan is in compliance with the\nprovisions of Rule 10b5-1. Compliance with Rule 10b5-1 is solely the responsibility of the Insider.\n2. Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nThis Policy Statement’s trading restrictions do not apply to purchases of Company stock as part of the employee stock\npurchase plan resulting from periodic payroll contributions to the plan under an election made at the time of enrollment in the plan if\nthe participant was not in possession of material, non-public information at the time of such election. The trading restrictions do\napply, however, to sales of Company stock purchased under the employee stock purchase plan.\n5\n3. Cash Exercise of Stock Options\nThis Policy Statement’s trading restrictions generally do not apply to the exercise of a vested stock option solely for cash.\nThe trading restrictions do apply, however, to any sale of the underlying stock, and to a cashless exercise of the option through a\nbroker, as this entails selling a portion of the underlying stock to cover the costs of the exercise. This policy Statement’s trading\nrestrictions also do not apply to the use of shares held by the Insider or otherwise deliverable to the Insider upon option exercise to\npay the exercise price or any sums required by federal, state or local tax law to be withheld with respect to the issuance of shares\nupon exercise.\n4. Grants of Restricted Stock\nThis Policy Statement’s trading restrictions do not apply to grants of restricted stock by the Company, but do apply to\nsubsequent sales of such stock upon vesting. In addition, this Policy Statement’s trading restrictions do not apply to the deduction by\nthe Company from the shares of Common Stock issued under any restricted stock award to pay any sums required by federal, state or\nlocal tax law to be withheld with respect to the issuance, vesting or payment pursuant to the restricted stock award.\nD. Pre-Clearance of Trades\nTo ensure and maintain compliance with this Policy Statement and to ensure compliance with the accelerated reporting\nrequirements under Section 16 of the Exchange Act mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, all transactions in the Company’s\nsecurities (acquisitions, dispositions, transfers, etc.), including the execution of a Qualified Rule 10b5-1 Plan, by members of the\nCompany’s Board of Directors, executive officers and other persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act must be pre-cleared in\nadvance by the Policy Administrator. The Policy Administrator will use its reasonable best efforts to provide approval or disapproval\nwithin two business days, but is not obligated to do so. Neither the Company nor the Policy Administrator shall be liable for any\ndelays that may occur due to the pre-clearance process. If the transaction is pre-cleared by the Policy Administrator, it must be\nexecuted by the end of the second business day after receipt of pre-clearance. Notwithstanding receipt of pre-clearance of a\ntransaction, if an Insider becomes aware of material, non-public information after receiving the pre-clearance but prior to the\nexecution of the transaction, the Insider may not execute the transaction. Promptly following execution of the transaction, but in no\nevent later than the end of the first business day after the execution of the transaction, the Insider must notify the Policy\nAdministrator and provide details regarding the transaction sufficient to complete the required Section 16 filing.\nAll members of the Company’s Board of Directors and each of its executive officers are required to issue to the Company a\nlimited power-of-attorney in the form substantively similar to that attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Company will maintain on file\nsuch power-of-attorney solely for the purpose of enabling the Company and the individual to comply with SEC reporting\nrequirements.\nEmployees of the Company who are not members of the Board of Directors or executive officers may, but are not required\nto, pre-clear transactions in the Company’s securities in the same manner as set forth above. Such employees are not required to\nnotify the Policy Administrator following execution of the transaction.\n6\nPlease note that such pre-clearance does not provide the insider with immunity from investigation or suit, for which it is the\nresponsibility of the individual to comply with the federal securities and regulations.\nIV. CONSEQUENCES OF POLICY VIOLATIONS\nThe consequences of prohibited insider trading can be severe. Consequences for individuals who trade on inside information\nor who tip inside information to others who then trade on that tip include:\n• disgorgement of the profit made or the loss avoided by trading;\n• payment for the loss suffered by the persons who purchased securities from or sold securities to the insider tippee;\n• a civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided;\n• a criminal fine (no matter how small the profit) of up to $5 million; and\n• a jail term of up to twenty years.\nConsequences for the Company (as well as possibly any supervisory person) that fails to take appropriate steps to prevent\nillegal trading include:\n• a civil penalty of the greater of $1 million or three times the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of the\nemployee’s violation;\n• subject to potential private lawsuit by contemporaneous traders for trading-related damages; and\n• a criminal penalty of up to $25 million.\nFurthermore, if an employee violates federal or state insider trading or tipping laws or this Policy Statement, Company-\nimposed sanctions, including dismissal for cause, could result. A violation of this Policy Statement is not necessarily the same as a\nviolation of law. In fact, for the reasons indicated above, the Company’s policy is intended to be broader than the law. The Company\nreserves the right to determine, in its own discretion and on the basis of the information available to it, whether its policy has been\nviolated. The Company may determine that specific conduct violates its policy, whether or not the conduct also violates the law. It is\nnot necessary for the Company to await the filing or conclusion of a civil or criminal action against the alleged violator before taking\ndisciplinary action.\nAny of the above consequences — even an SEC investigation that does not result in prosecution — can be extremely costly,\ntarnish one’s reputation and irreparably damage a career or a company.\nV. POLICY ADMINISTRATION & REPORTING\nThis Policy Statement shall be administered by the “Policy Administrator,” who shall be the Company’s General Counsel.\nThe Policy Administrator may, however, change from time to time, and Insiders are encouraged to consult the copy of this Policy\nStatement that is included on the Company’s website to obtain current information concerning the Policy Administrator.\n7\nThe duties of the Policy Administrator include the following: (1) administering and interpreting this Policy Statement, (2)\nmonitoring and enforcing compliance with all policy provisions and procedures, (3) responding to all inquiries relating to this Policy\nStatement and its procedures and (4) identifying employees to designated as Restricted Insiders.\nAny Insider who violates this Policy Statement or any federal or state laws governing insider trading or tipping, or knows of\nany such violation by any other Insider, must report the violation immediately to the Policy Administrator. Upon learning of any such\nviolation, the Policy Administrator, in consultation with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and/or legal\ncounsel will determine whether the Company should release any material, non-public information or whether the Company should\nreport the violation to the SEC or other appropriate governmental authority.\nVI. COMPANY ASSISTANCE\nAny person who has any questions about specific transactions or this Policy Statement in general may obtain additional\nguidance from the Policy Administrator. The ultimate responsibility for adhering to this Policy Statement and avoiding improper\ntransactions, however, rests with the Insider. In this regard, it is imperative that Insiders use their best judgment to avoid even the\nappearance of impropriety.\nVII. CERTIFICATIONS\nAs a condition to employment, all employees will be required to certify, by signing below, their understanding of and intent\nto comply with this Policy Statement. Members of the Board of Directors, senior management and other personnel may be required\nto certify compliance on an annual basis.\n8\nCERTIFICATION\nThe undersigned hereby certifies that he/she has read and understands, and agrees to comply with, the Alphatec Holdings,\nInc.

Todd Koning\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n(principal financial and accounting officer of the Company)\nExhibit 97\nCLAWBACK POLICY\n1. Introduction. The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Alphatec Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) believes that it is in\nthe best interests of the Company and its shareholders to create and maintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability\nand that reinforces the Company’s pay-for-performance compensation philosophy. The Board has therefore adopted this policy (the\n“Policy”) to provide for the recoupment of certain executive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from\nmaterial noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws. This Policy is designed to comply\nwith Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).\n2. Administration. This Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so designated by the Board, the Compensation\nCommittee of the Board, in which case references herein to the Board shall be deemed references to the Compensation Committee.\nAny determinations made by the Board shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\n3. Covered Executives. This Policy applies to the Company’s current and former executive officers, as determined by the\nBoard in accordance with Section 10D of the Exchange Act and the listing standards of the national securities exchange on which\nthe Company’s securities are listed (“Covered Executives”).\n4. Recoupment; Accounting Restatement. If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial\nstatements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the\nBoard will require reimbursement or forfeiture of any excess Incentive Compensation (as defined below) received by any Covered\nExecutive during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an\naccounting restatement.\n5. Incentive Compensation. For purposes of this Policy, Incentive Compensation means compensation that is granted,\nearned, or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure (as defined below), including,\nwithout limitation, the following: (a) annual bonuses and other short- and long-term cash incentives; (b) stock options; (c) stock\nappreciation rights; (d) restricted stock; (e) restricted stock units; (f) performance shares; or (g) performance units. For purposes of\nthis Policy, Financial Reporting Measures include: (a) Company stock price; (b) total shareholder return; (c) revenues; (d) net\nincome; (e) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA); (f) funds from operations; (g) liquidity\nmeasures such as working capital or operating cash flow; (h) return measures such as return on invested capital or return on assets;\nand (i) earnings measures such as earnings per share.\n6. Excess Incentive Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery. The amount to be recovered will be the excess of the\nIncentive Compensation paid to the Covered Executive based on the erroneous data over the Incentive Compensation that would\nhave been paid to the Covered Executive had it been based on the restated results, as determined by the Board. If the Board cannot\ndetermine the amount of excess Incentive Compensation received by the Covered Executive directly from the information in the\naccounting restatement, then it will make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting\nrestatement. For the avoidance of doubt, any Incentive Compensation awarded to a Covered Executive before such\nperson became a Covered Executive is not subject to this Policy.\n7. Method of Recoupment. The Board will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recouping Incentive\nCompensation hereunder, which may include, without limitation:\n(a) requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive Compensation previously paid;\n(b) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other\ndisposition of any equity-based awards;\n(c) offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered\nExecutive;\n(d) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\n(e) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Board.\n8. No Indemnification. The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any incorrectly\nawarded Incentive Compensation.\n9. Interpretation. The Board is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary,\nappropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is\nconsistent with the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or standards adopted by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission or any national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed.\n10.Effective Date. This Policy shall be effective as of December 1, 2023 (the “Effective Date”) and shall apply to\nIncentive Compensation that is approved, awarded or granted to Covered Executives on or after that date.\n11.Amendment; Termination.
