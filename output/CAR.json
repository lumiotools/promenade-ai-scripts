(**NASDAQ: CAR**) announced financial results for third quarter 2024 today.\n\nWe ended the quarter with revenues of nearly $3.5 billion, net income of $238 million, and Adjusted EBITDA1 of $503 million.\n\n“We maintained a strong focus on pricing throughout the quarter, prioritizing higher margin business which allowed us to keep our revenue per day stable with the Americas nearly flat,” said Joe Ferraro, Avis Budget Group Chief Executive Officer. “Vehicle utilization improved by approximately 2 points throughout the Company as we exercised strong fleet discipline. Our U.S. model year 2025 buy is well underway and expected to drive significant savings as these vehicles are rotated into our fleet. Lastly, the holidays look strong, and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this demand.”\n\n**Q3 HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Revenues of nearly $3.5 billion with pricing down 2% and rental days in line with third quarter 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA in the Americas was $384 million, driven by an improvement of vehicle utilization of more than one point and strong summer pricing, offset by higher fleet costs as compared to third quarter 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA in International was $139 million, driven by a 5% increase in rental days as well as vehicle utilization improvement of more than three points as compared to third quarter 2023.\n  * Issued $700 million of unsecured Senior Notes and used the proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under our secured floating rate term loan due 2029 in October with the additional proceeds invested in our fleet.\n  * We repurchased approximately 526,000 shares of common stock for a total of nearly $43 million through October 30th.\n\n\n\nOur liquidity position, including committed and uncommitted facilities, at the end of the quarter was over $1.2 billion, with an additional $3.2 billion of fleet funding capacity after giving effect to a reduction in our asset-backed variable-funding financing facilities effective November 1. We have well-laddered corporate debt and have no meaningful maturities until 2027.\n\n______________________1Adjusted EBITDA and certain other measures in this release are non-GAAP financial measures. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Metrics\" and the tables that accompany this release for the definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**INVESTOR CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nWe will host a conference call to discuss our third quarter results on November 1, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.(ET). Investors may access the call on our investor relations website at ir.avisbudgetgroup.com or by dialing (877) 407-2991. A replay of the call will be available on our website and at (877) 660-6853 using conference code 13743687.\n\n**ABOUT AVIS BUDGET GROUP**\n\nWe are a leading global provider of mobility solutions, both through our Avis and Budget brands, which have approximately 10,250 rental locations in approximately 180 countries around the world, and through our Zipcar brand, which is the world's leading car sharing network. We operate most of our car rental locations in North America, Europe and Australasia directly, and operate primarily through licensees in other parts of the world. We are headquartered in Parsippany, N.J. More information is available at avisbudgetgroup.com.\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY METRICS**\n\n_This release includes financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, as well as other financial measures, that are not considered generally accepted accounting principle (“GAAP”) measures as defined under SEC rules. Important information regarding such non-GAAP measures is contained in the tables within this release and in Appendix I, including the definitions of these measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures._\n\n_We measure performance principally using the following key metrics: (i) rental days, (ii) revenue per day, (iii) vehicle utilization, and (iv) per-unit fleet costs. Our rental days, revenue per day and vehicle utilization metrics are all calculated based on the actual rental of the vehicle during a 24-hour period. We believe that this methodology provides management with the most relevant metrics in order to effectively manage the performance of our business. Our calculations may not be comparable to the calculations of similarly-titled metrics by other companies. We present currency exchange rate effects on our key metrics to provide a method of assessing how our business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Currency exchange rate effects are calculated by translating the current-period's results at the prior-period average exchange rates plus any related gains and losses on currency hedges._\n\n**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\n_Certain statements in this press release constitute_ _“forward-looking statements” as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements contained herein are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any such forward-looking statements.

utilize derivative instruments, and the impact of derivative instruments we utilize, which can be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, fuel prices and exchange rates, changes in government

New risk factors, factors beyond our control, or changes in the impact of identified risk factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. Moreover, we do not assume responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted or anticipated. Other factors and assumptions not identified above, including those discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”_ _set forth in Part II, Item 7, in \"Risk Factors,\" set forth in Part I, Item 1A, and in other portions of our_ _2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 16, 2024 (the “2023_ _Form 10-K”), as well as in similarly titled sections set forth in Part I, Item 2 and Part II, Item 1A of our subsequently filed quarterly reports, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements._\n\n_Although we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, any or all of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected. We undertake no obligation to release any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events. For any forward-looking statements contained in any document, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before non-vehicle related depreciation and amortization; any impairment charges; restructuring and other related charges; early extinguishment of debt costs; non-vehicle related interest; transaction-related costs, net; legal matters, which includes amounts recorded in excess of $5 million related to class action lawsuits and personal injury matters; non-operational charges related to shareholder activist activity, which includes third-party advisory, legal and other professional fees; COVID-19 charges, net; cloud computing costs; other (income) expense, net; and income taxes.\n\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as a supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of our operating businesses and in comparing our results from period to period. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it allows them to assess our results of operations and financial condition on the same basis that management uses internally. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA from net income (loss) recognized under GAAP is provided on Table 5.\n\n**Adjusted Free Cash Flow** Represents net cash provided by operating activities adjusted to reflect the cash inflows and outflows relating to capital expenditures, the investing and financing activities of our vehicle programs, asset sales, if any, and to exclude debt extinguishment costs, transaction-related costs, restructuring and other related charges, charges for legal matters, net, which includes amounts recorded in excess of $5 million related to class action lawsuits and personal injury matters, COVID-19 charges, other (income) expense, and non-operational charges related to shareholder activist activity. We believe that Adjusted Free Cash Flow is useful to management and investors in measuring the cash generated that is available to be used to repay debt obligations, repurchase stock, pay dividends and invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions. Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be construed as a substitute in measuring operating results or liquidity, and our presentation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow from net cash provided by operating activities recognized under GAAP is provided on Table 5.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA Margin** Represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues.\n\n**Available Rental Days** Defined as Average Rental Fleet times the numbers of days in a given period.\n\n**Average Rental Fleet** Represents the average number of vehicles in our fleet during a given period of time.\n\n**Currency Exchange Rate Effects** Represents the difference between current-period results as reported and current-period results translated at the prior-period average exchange rates plus any related currency hedges.\n\n**Net Corporate Debt** Represents corporate debt minus cash and cash equivalents.\n\n**Net Corporate Leverage** Represents Net Corporate Debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months prior to the date of calculation.\n\n**Per-Unit Fleet Costs** Represents vehicle depreciation, lease charges and gain or loss on vehicles sales, divided by Average Rental Fleet.\n\n**Rental Days** Represents the total number of days (or portion thereof) a vehicle was rented during a 24-hour period.\n\n**Revenue per Day** Represents revenues divided by Rental Days.\n\n**Vehicle Utilization** Represents Rental Days divided by Available Rental Days.\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/OWEyODg2OWItYjI5MC00ZDljLTg0YjgtZjZmMGE1NjMyNWUzLTEwMjIwMDU=/tiny/Avis-Budget-Group-Inc-.png)\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/email-alerts)\n  * [RSS News Feeds](/rss-news-feeds)\n  * [Print Page](javascript:window.print\\(\\);)\n  * Email Page\n  * [Search](/search)\n\n\n\n  * [ Contact Us ](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/contact-us)\n  * [ Developers ](https://developer.avis.com/)\n  * [ Licensing ](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/contact-us/#avisbudgetlicensing)\n  * [ Connect on Linked In ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/avis-budget-group/)\n\n\n\n  * [ Contact Us ](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/contact-us)\n  * [ Developers ](https://developer.avis.com/)\n  * [ Licensing ](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/contact-us/#avisbudgetlicensing)\n  * [ ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/avis-budget-group/)\n\n\n\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/privacy-policy)\n  * [Terms of Service](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/terms-of-use)\n  * [Code of Conduct](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Code-of-Conduct_rev2023_vF.pdf)\n  * [Accessibility](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/accessibility)\n\n\n\nCopyright © Avis Budget Group 2024.

(**NASDAQ: CAR**) announced financial results for third quarter 2024 today.\n\nWe ended the quarter with revenues of nearly $3.5 billion, net income of $238 million, and Adjusted EBITDA1 of $503 million.\n\n“We maintained a strong focus on pricing throughout the quarter, prioritizing higher margin business which allowed us to keep our revenue per day stable with the Americas nearly flat,” said Joe Ferraro, Avis Budget Group Chief Executive Officer. “Vehicle utilization improved by approximately 2 points throughout the Company as we exercised strong fleet discipline. Our U.S. model year 2025 buy is well underway and expected to drive significant savings as these vehicles are rotated into our fleet. Lastly, the holidays look strong, and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this demand.”\n\n**Q3 HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Revenues of nearly $3.5 billion with pricing down 2% and rental days in line with third quarter 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA in the Americas was $384 million, driven by an improvement of vehicle utilization of more than one point and strong summer pricing, offset by higher fleet costs as compared to third quarter 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA in International was $139 million, driven by a 5% increase in rental days as well as vehicle utilization improvement of more than three points as compared to third quarter 2023.\n  * Issued $700 million of unsecured Senior Notes and used the proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under our secured floating rate term loan due 2029 in October with the additional proceeds invested in our fleet.\n  * We repurchased approximately 526,000 shares of common stock for a total of nearly $43 million through October 30th.\n\n\n\nOur liquidity position, including committed and uncommitted facilities, at the end of the quarter was over $1.2 billion, with an additional $3.2 billion of fleet funding capacity after giving effect to a reduction in our asset-backed variable-funding financing facilities effective November 1. We have well-laddered corporate debt and have no meaningful maturities until 2027.\n\n______________________1Adjusted EBITDA and certain other measures in this release are non-GAAP financial measures. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Metrics\" and the tables that accompany this release for the definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**INVESTOR CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nWe will host a conference call to discuss our third quarter results on November 1, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.(ET). Investors may access the call on our investor relations website at ir.avisbudgetgroup.com or by dialing (877) 407-2991. A replay of the call will be available on our website and at (877) 660-6853 using conference code 13743687.\n\n**ABOUT AVIS BUDGET GROUP**\n\nWe are a leading global provider of mobility solutions, both through our Avis and Budget brands, which have approximately 10,250 rental locations in approximately 180 countries around the world, and through our Zipcar brand, which is the world's leading car sharing network. We operate most of our car rental locations in North America, Europe and Australasia directly, and operate primarily through licensees in other parts of the world. We are headquartered in Parsippany, N.J. More information is available at avisbudgetgroup.com.\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY METRICS**\n\n_This release includes financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, as well as other financial measures, that are not considered generally accepted accounting principle (“GAAP”) measures as defined under SEC rules. Important information regarding such non-GAAP measures is contained in the tables within this release and in Appendix I, including the definitions of these measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures._\n\n_We measure performance principally using the following key metrics: (i) rental days, (ii) revenue per day, (iii) vehicle utilization, and (iv) per-unit fleet costs. Our rental days, revenue per day and vehicle utilization metrics are all calculated based on the actual rental of the vehicle during a 24-hour period. We believe that this methodology provides management with the most relevant metrics in order to effectively manage the performance of our business. Our calculations may not be comparable to the calculations of similarly-titled metrics by other companies. We present currency exchange rate effects on our key metrics to provide a method of assessing how our business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Currency exchange rate effects are calculated by translating the current-period's results at the prior-period average exchange rates plus any related gains and losses on currency hedges._\n\n**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\n_Certain statements in this press release constitute_ _“forward-looking statements” as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements contained herein are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our future financial performance, business strategy, projected plans and objectives. These statements may be identified by the fact that they do not relate to historical or current facts and may use words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “would,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates,” “plans,” “forecasts,” “guidance,” and similar words, expressions or phrases.

used vehicles either in the used vehicle market or under repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs;_\n\n\n  * _the results of operations or financial condition of the manufacturers of our vehicles, which could impact their ability to perform their payment obligations under our agreements with them, including repurchase and/or guaranteed depreciation arrangements, and/or their

Eastern Europe,__or civil unrest in the locations in which we operate, and_ _the potential effects of sanctions on the world economy and markets and/or international trade_ _;_\n\n\n  * _any substantial changes in the cost or supply of fuel, vehicle parts, energy, labor or other resources on which we depend to operate our business, including as a result of pandemics, inflation, the

achieve our business plans and strategies, achieve and maintain cost savings and adapt our business to changes in mobility;_\n\n\n  * _political, economic or commercial instability in the countries in which we operate, and our ability to conform to multiple and conflicting laws or regulations in tho_ _se countries;_\n\n\n  * _the performance of the used vehicle market from time to time, including our ability to dispose of vehicles in the used vehicle market on attractive terms;_\n\n\n  * _our dependence on third-party distribution channels, third-party suppliers of other services an_ _d co-marketing arrangements with third parties;_\n\n\n  * _risks related to completed or future acquisitions or investments that we may pursue, including the incurrence of incremental indebtedness to help fund such transactions and our ability to promptly and effectively integrate any acquired businesses or capitalize on joint ventures, partnerships and other investments;_\n\n\n  * _our ability to utilize derivative instruments, and the impact of derivative instruments we utilize, which can be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, fuel prices and exchange rates, changes in government regulations and other factors;_\n\n\n  * _our exposure to uninsured or unpaid claims in excess of historical levels and our ability to obtain insurance at desired levels and the cost of that insurance;_\n\n\n  * _risks associated with litigation or governmental or regulatory inquiries, or any failure or inability to comply with laws, regulations or contractual obligations or any changes in laws, regulations or contractual obligations, including with respect to personally identifiable information and consumer privacy, labor and employment, and tax;_\n\n\n  * _risks related to protecting the integrity of, and preventing unauthorized access to, our information technology systems or those of our third-party vendors, licensees, dealers, independent operators and independent contractors, and protecting the confidential information of our employees and customers against security breaches, including physical or cybersecurity breaches, attacks, or other disruptions, compliance with privacy and data protection regulation, and the effects of any potential increase in cyberattacks on the world economy and markets and/or international trade;_\n\n\n  * _any impact on us from the actions of our third-party vendors, licensees, dealers, independent operators and independent contractors and/or disputes that may arise out of our agreements with such parties;_\n\n\n  * _any major disruptions in our communication networks or information systems;_\n\n\n  * _risks related to tax obligations and the effect of future changes in tax laws and accounting standards;_\n\n\n  * _risks related to our indebtedness, including our substantial outstanding debt obligations, recent and future interest rate increases, which increase our financing costs, downgrades by rating

asset-backed securities and use of the global lending markets;_\n\n\n  * _our ability to meet the financial and other covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, or to obtain a waiver or amendment of such covenants should we be unable to meet such covenants;_\n\n\n  * _significant changes in the assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill or intangible assets, which could result in a significant impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets; and_\n\n\n  * _other business, economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, political or technological factors affecting our operations, pricing or services._\n\n\n\n_We operate in a continuously changing business environment and new risk factors emerge from time to time. New risk factors, factors beyond our control, or changes in the impact of identified risk factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. Moreover, we do not assume responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted or anticipated. Other factors and assumptions not identified above, including those discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”_ _set forth in Part II, Item 7, in \"Risk Factors,\" set forth in Part I, Item 1A, and in other portions of our_ _2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 16, 2024 (the “2023_ _Form 10-K”), as well as in similarly titled sections set forth in Part I, Item 2 and Part II, Item 1A of our subsequently filed quarterly reports, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements._\n\n_Although we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, any or all of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected. We undertake no obligation to release any revisions to any forward-looking statements, to report events or to report the occurrence of unanticipated events. For any forward-looking statements contained in any document, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For additional information concerning forward-looking statements and other important factors, refer to our_ _2023_ _Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before non-vehicle related depreciation and amortization; any impairment charges; restructuring and other related charges; early extinguishment of debt costs; non-vehicle related interest; transaction-related costs, net; legal matters, which includes amounts recorded in excess of $5 million related to class action lawsuits and personal injury matters; non-operational charges related to shareholder activist activity, which includes third-party advisory, legal and other professional fees; COVID-19 charges, net; cloud computing costs; other (income) expense, net; and income taxes.\n\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as a supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of our operating businesses and in comparing our results from period to period. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it allows them to assess our results of operations and financial condition on the same basis that management uses internally. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA from net income (loss) recognized under GAAP is provided on Table 5.\n\n**Adjusted Free Cash Flow** Represents net cash provided by operating activities adjusted to reflect the cash inflows and outflows relating to capital expenditures, the investing and financing activities of our vehicle programs, asset sales, if any, and to exclude debt extinguishment costs, transaction-related costs, restructuring and other related charges, charges for legal matters, net, which includes amounts recorded in excess of $5 million related to class action lawsuits and personal injury matters, COVID-19 charges, other (income) expense, and non-operational charges related to shareholder activist activity. We believe that Adjusted Free Cash Flow is useful to management and investors in measuring the cash generated that is available to be used to repay debt obligations, repurchase stock, pay dividends and invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions. Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be construed as a substitute in measuring operating results or liquidity, and our presentation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow from net cash provided by operating activities recognized under GAAP is provided on Table 5.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA Margin** Represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues.\n\n**Available Rental Days** Defined as Average Rental Fleet times the numbers of days in a given period.\n\n**Average Rental Fleet** Represents the average number of vehicles in our fleet during a given period of time.\n\n**Currency Exchange Rate Effects** Represents the difference between current-period results as reported and current-period results translated at the prior-period average exchange rates plus any related currency hedges.\n\n**Net Corporate Debt** Represents corporate debt minus cash and cash equivalents.\n\n**Net Corporate Leverage** Represents Net Corporate Debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months prior to the date of calculation.\n\n**Per-Unit Fleet Costs** Represents vehicle depreciation, lease charges and gain or loss on vehicles sales, divided by Average Rental Fleet.\n\n**Rental Days** Represents the total number of days (or portion thereof) a vehicle was rented during a 24-hour period.\n\n**Revenue per Day** Represents revenues divided by Rental Days.\n\n**Vehicle Utilization** Represents Rental Days divided by Available Rental Days.\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/OWEyODg2OWItYjI5MC00ZDljLTg0YjgtZjZmMGE1NjMyNWUzLTEwMjIwMDU=/tiny/Avis-Budget-Group-Inc-.png)\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/email-alerts)\n  * [RSS News Feeds](/rss-news-feeds)\n  * [Print Page](javascript:window.print\\(\\);)\n  * Email Page\n  * [Search](/search)\n\n\n\n  * [ Contact Us ](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/contact-us)\n  * [ Developers ](https://developer.avis.com/)\n  * [ Licensing ](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/contact-us/#avisbudgetlicensing)\n  * [ Connect on Linked In ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/avis-budget-group/)\n\n\n\n  * [ Contact Us ](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/contact-us)\n  * [ Developers ](https://developer.avis.com/)\n  * [ Licensing ](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/contact-us/#avisbudgetlicensing)\n  * [ ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/avis-budget-group/)\n\n\n\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/privacy-policy)\n  * [Terms of Service](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/terms-of-use)\n  * [Code of Conduct](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Code-of-Conduct_rev2023_vF.pdf)\n  * [Accessibility](https://www.avisbudgetgroup.com/accessibility)\n\n\n\nCopyright © Avis Budget Group 2024.

(NASDAQ: CAR) (the “Company”) announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Avis Budget Car Rental, LLC and Avis Budget Finance, Inc. (together, the “Issuers”), priced a private offering of $700 million aggregate principal amount of 8.250% senior notes due 2030 (the “Notes”), which represents a $200 million increase from the previously announced size of the offering. The Notes will have a maturity date of January 15, 2030. The closing of the offering of the Notes is expected to occur on September 13, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The Notes will be issued at par and guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries.\n\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of indebtedness, including, without limitation, repayment of its floating rate term loan C maturing in 2029 and its outstanding fleet debt, and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing.\n\nThe Notes and related guarantees are being offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or, outside the United States, to persons other than “U.S. persons” in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes and related guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act.\n\nThis press release is for informational purposes only and is not an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell any securities. Any offers of the Notes will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum.\n\n**About Avis Budget Group** We are a leading global provider of mobility solutions, both through our Avis and Budget brands, which have approximately 10,250 rental locations in approximately 180 countries around the world, and through our Zipcar brand, which is the world's leading car sharing network.
