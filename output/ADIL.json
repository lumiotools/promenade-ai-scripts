(NASDAQ: ADIL) (“Adial” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies for the treatment and prevention of addiction and related disorders, announced that it has completed a pharmacokinetics (PK) study of AD04, the Company’s lead investigational genetically targeted, serotonin-3 receptor antagonist, and therapeutic agent for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in heavy drinking patients (defined as less than 10 drinks/drinking day). This data will help the Company optimize study design elements needed for the upcoming Phase 3 clinical trial of AD04. Completion of this study also satisfied an FDA requirement for the upcoming Phase 3 clinical trials of AD04.\n\nThe study, a single-center, relative bioavailability, open label study, enrolled a total of 30 healthy adult volunteers in two cohorts. Cohort 1 (n=6) was a randomized, open-label, 2-sequence, 2-period crossover study to evaluate the PK variability of ondansetron from AD04 0.33 and 0.99mg. Cohort 2 (n=24) was a randomized, open-label, 6-sequence, 4-period crossover study to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the AD04 0.33mg tablet to a marketed ondansetron 4mg tablet, dose proportionality of ondansetron PK between AD04 0.33 and 0.99mg, and the effect of food on the bioavailability of ondansetron administered as the AD04 0.33mg tablet. The results of this study showed that, as a result of the lower dose, AD04 0.33mg delivered lower ondansetron PK exposure than the marketed reference standard ondansetron 4mg tablet; ondansetron pharmacokinetic exposure increased in proportion to dose across a 3-fold AD04 dose range; and AD04 can be taken in fed or fasted states.\n\nCary Claiborne, President and Chief Executive Officer of Adial commented, “Completion of this study achieves our goal to obtain the data we needed to design a more precise and informed Phase 3 trial protocol, including evaluating the optimal dosing regimen to maximize the efficacy and safety of AD04 in patients with AUD. Its completion is in accord with previous guidance provided by the FDA and is intended to enhance the likelihood of success in our upcoming Phase 3 trial. This relatively short and low-cost study was a key element of our strategy to advance ongoing partnership discussions. Additionally, the study will provide data necessary to support an application for approval of AD04 under a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway with the FDA. We plan to engage with the FDA during Q4 2024 with the results of this pharmacokinetics study and obtain feedback which will assist with the AD04 Phase 3 study program. This meeting is an important next step to further advancing AD04 towards regulatory approval.”\n\n**About AD04** AD04 (0.33mg ondansetron taken orally twice daily) acts upon the 5HT3 pathway and is thought to reduce alcohol craving. This mode of action is distinct from, but complimentary to, the currently approved therapies for AUD. Post-hoc analyses of Adial’s prior clinical studies have indicated that patients with mutations in the 5HT3 receptor experience substantial and clinically meaningful reductions in alcohol consumption. The specific mutations that appear to respond to AD04 are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on rs1150226-AG (“AG”) or rs1176713-GG (“GG”) genotypes in the gene that encodes the 5-HT3A receptor subunit. These genes are thought to affect the binding of AD04 to the 5HT3 receptor and its function. Furthermore, in both previous clinical trials, AD04 had similar adverse events to placebo, which further supports that it is likely to be extremely safe and tolerable. Adial has already developed a companion diagnostic test (CDx) to identify the specific genotypes that benefit from AD04. This test was used in its Phase 3 ONWARD study, will be used in future clinical studies, and will be commercially available at the time of AD04’s launch.\n\n**About Adial Pharmaceuticals, Inc.** Adial Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of treatments for addictions and related disorders. The Company’s lead investigational new drug product, AD04, is a genetically targeted, serotonin-3 receptor antagonist, therapeutic agent for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in heavy drinking patients and was recently investigated in the Company’s ONWARD™ pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for the potential treatment of AUD in subjects with certain target genotypes identified using the Company’s companion diagnostic genetic test. ONWARD showed promising results in reducing drinking in heavy drinking patients, and no overt safety or tolerability concerns. AD04 is also believed to have the potential to treat other addictive disorders such as Opioid Use Disorder, gambling, and obesity.

Accessibility Statement\n\n## Accessibility Statement\n\n  * www.adial.com\n  * November 29, 2024\n\n\n\n### Compliance status\n\nWe firmly believe that the internet should be available and accessible to anyone, and are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of circumstance and ability.\n\nTo fulfill this, we aim to adhere as strictly as possible to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that the website is accessible to all people: blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment, cognitive disabilities, and more.\n\nThis website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as accessible as possible at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the website’s UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs.\n\nAdditionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level constantly. This application remediates the website’s HTML, adapts Its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by the blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments.\n\nIf you’ve found a malfunction or have ideas for improvement, we’ll be happy to hear from you. You can reach out to the website’s operators by using the following email \n\n### Screen-reader and keyboard navigation\n\nOur website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various different behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with screen-readers are able to read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements, alongside console screenshots of code examples:\n\n  1. **Screen-reader optimization:** we run a background process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website. In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels; descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others. Additionally, the background process scans all of the website’s images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described. It will also extract texts that are embedded within the image, using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website.\n\nThese adjustments are compatible with all popular screen readers, including JAWS and NVDA.\n\n  2. **Keyboard navigation optimization:** The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML, and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus, available at any time by clicking Alt+1, or as the first elements of the site while navigating with the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and not allow the focus drift outside of it.\n\nUsers can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements.\n\n\n\n\n### Disability profiles supported in our website\n\n  * **Epilepsy Safe Mode:** this profile enables people with epilepsy to use the website safely by eliminating the risk of seizures that result from flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.\n  * **Visually Impaired Mode:** this mode adjusts the website for the convenience of users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataract, Glaucoma, and others.\n  * **Cognitive Disability Mode:** this mode provides different assistive options to help users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, to focus on the essential elements of the website more easily.\n  * **ADHD Friendly Mode:** this mode helps users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders to read, browse, and focus on the main website elements more easily while significantly reducing distractions.\n  * **Blindness Mode:** this mode configures the website to be compatible with screen-readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack. A screen-reader is software for blind users that is installed on a computer and smartphone, and websites must be compatible with it.\n  * **Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired):** this profile enables motor-impaired persons to operate the website using the keyboard Tab, Shift+Tab, and the Enter keys. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements.\n\n\n\n### Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments\n\n  1. **Font adjustments –** users, can increase and decrease its size, change its family (type), adjust the spacing, alignment, line height, and more.\n  2. **Color adjustments –** users can select various color contrast profiles such as light, dark, inverted, and monochrome. Additionally, users can swap color schemes of titles, texts, and backgrounds, with over 7 different coloring options.\n  3. **Animations –** epileptic users can stop all running animations with the click of a button. Animations controlled by the interface include videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions.\n  4. **Content highlighting –** users can choose to emphasize important elements such as links and titles. They can also choose to highlight focused or hovered elements only.\n  5. **Audio muting –** users with hearing devices may experience headaches or other issues due to automatic audio playing. This option lets users mute the entire website instantly.\n  6. **Cognitive disorders –** we utilize a search engine that is linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing people with cognitive disorders to decipher meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and others.\n  7. **Additional functions –** we provide users the option to change cursor color and size, use a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and many other functions.\n\n\n\n### Browser and assistive technology compatibility\n\nWe aim to support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS and NVDA (screen readers), both for Windows and for MAC users.\n\n### Notes, comments, and feedback\n\nDespite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating and improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility, following technological advancements. For any assistance, please reach out to \n"

(NASDAQ: ADIL)**(“Adial” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies for the treatment and prevention of addiction and related disorders, today provided a business update and reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\nCary Claiborne, President and Chief Executive Officer of Adial, stated, “We reached an important milestone this quarter with the successful database lock of the pharmacokinetics study for AD04, our lead investigational, genetically targeted therapeutic for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). The pharmacokinetics study is essential for validating AD04’s dosing and safety profile, and we expect to report topline results soon. This accomplishment would position us to begin regulatory preparations, reinforcing our mission to bring a safe, effective AUD treatment to market.”\n\n“Building on our commitment to personalized addiction care, we have entered into a strategic partnership with Boudicca Dx to support the development plan for our companion diagnostic genetic test and help ensure compliance with FDA guidelines. This innovative tool is designed to identify genetic markers that indicate a patient’s responsiveness to AD04, paving the way for more targeted and effective treatment options.”\n\n“Furthermore, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recently introduced a new, broader definition of recovery, which expands the concept beyond abstinence alone. This inclusive perspective acknowledges the various paths individuals may take in their recovery journeys. By aligning with this comprehensive definition, we are optimistic that it will stimulate additional support for programs like AD04. Overall, we are proud of the meaningful progress made during the quarter and believe we are making progress in advancing AD04 toward commercialization,” concluded Mr. Claiborne.\n\n**Other Developments**\n\n_Management_\n\nOn November 5, 2024, [Adial announced the appointment of Vinay Shah as Chief Financial Officer](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=f4c_j_1uz3318wuypJ-OZ7UReOPGq2epCSNqa6YL_fyXbXUOYkUosMd_maVqeftGkvlOMKeaQEwJnOZuextkqiJ26GLlQLBWt059Smh5I1-MBV5yRauMDeZin5BGkQXwqotM4UYtsdi7Kr2ULTN-57en7bExQ7i2Z5tIO6GxD4r5tKhMLvS0iMfpu4eC934wiG7fKydKCnrsobbASaD2iNNyn3CHeMVyYp60nhJNkPk9MeoHDvcl3NkSmfsfS727), effective November 16, 2024.\n\n_Patents_\n\nOn October 17, 2024, [Adial announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued a Notice of Allowance for a new patent](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=f4c_j_1uz3318wuypJ-OZw96imhI2T9KWVZ4v2D4ocMKxbBl_Hzg40KJ3_zIdPddH8Q4xATgY982-Y_1b5JoWhM6bj_xevxA_Ysn6rjSlsL9FA0JW2SsEpm70Rs1oOrQKj-Uy9pB6mufB8IIRUogOH04dzZ60IVBH9EwfCPji57_N8k1PamSV6fml4JwIbWzp70zjMa2SSxU8bqkFBSlXQtQ-zGD0rBWQSSRtCkN0SYS2PNSNsfNUFv4JQVHJfFwOY-6etEJV6HBLvNkXUeiEq-ckHAFdXnSUa8LZAXGb8d5-2ILlpJxvN00nKGuVNDgZs5ImTScwpkmHaTNhQ3aCjrVtLYhAce13QgzDRnwE9C5Vadbq-IAfaiEHEK-V78lLfrXCyDEOJzOmKgTb-kUpSUXsDYrxOdt2g_MsWEsdIrVxzxfmFY0Er_bJbLYjZaZFD7w94ZrR9BJCA6kcIf0lw==). The patent, once issued, will cover additional genotype combinations identified through the Company’s proprietary genetic diagnostic tool.\n\nOn July 31, 2024, Adial announced that, after an extensive review of data and information from the Onward Study, it [had filed a new patent application](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=h2_1AmkkNkeSvKt-n0I5SQmS-jblgNrp8wJXIUvcEeSTtprw_GuE-dNRMFeRATROd_qc55t3kWfqFDOFY2af23pRhGGfA7lvILlQGGsdPjHw52SkpHLgk-f1CsXk_MwbirBCSmacWtcMXl5qZiodiQJyER8JvMHD5fyDNU30m84GulVweeTnhE2_1cqZaJEXh0YR8hp_pfScvA-NuzhMGX26pFEwWEB0HyQskRJKHlP3WdmGdliAmksa72PaXtTM4qdpmS_db1bJPcfJB2tPbQ==) to protect core assets and extend IP exclusivity on its core technology. This patent, assuming granted, is expected to protect Adial’s core assets through at least 2044.\n\n_Financing_\n\nDuring the third quarter the Company received total gross proceeds of approximately $3.8 million from utilization of its at-the-market facility.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Cash and cash equivalents were $5.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $2.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents will fund its operating expenses into the second half of 2025 based on currently committed development plans. \n  * Research and development expenses increased by approximately $825 thousand (399%) in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change was due to an increase of approximately $771 thousand in clinical trial expenses related to the pharmacokinetics (PK) study during the quarter and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) expenses which increased by approximately $204 thousand, as stability testing took place to support the PK study. These increases were partially offset by modest decreases in license royalty expense and decreases in the salaries and equity-based compensation of R&D personnel. \n  * General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $29 thousand (3%) in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. \n  * Net Loss was $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Net Loss was primarily driven by the increases in R&D and G&A expenses described above.\n\n\n\n**About Adial Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nAdial Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapies for the treatment and prevention of addiction and related disorders.

Accessibility Statement\n\n## Accessibility Statement\n\n  * www.adial.com\n  * November 29, 2024\n\n\n\n### Compliance status\n\nWe firmly believe that the internet should be available and accessible to anyone, and are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of circumstance and ability.\n\nTo fulfill this, we aim to adhere as strictly as possible to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that the website is accessible to all people: blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment, cognitive disabilities, and more.\n\nThis website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as accessible as possible at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the website’s UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs.\n\nAdditionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level constantly. This application remediates the website’s HTML, adapts Its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by the blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments.\n\nIf you’ve found a malfunction or have ideas for improvement, we’ll be happy to hear from you. You can reach out to the website’s operators by using the following email \n\n### Screen-reader and keyboard navigation\n\nOur website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various different behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with screen-readers are able to read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements, alongside console screenshots of code examples:\n\n  1. **Screen-reader optimization:** we run a background process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website. In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels; descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others. Additionally, the background process scans all of the website’s images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described. It will also extract texts that are embedded within the image, using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website.\n\nThese adjustments are compatible with all popular screen readers, including JAWS and NVDA.\n\n  2. **Keyboard navigation optimization:** The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML, and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus, available at any time by clicking Alt+1, or as the first elements of the site while navigating with the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and not allow the focus drift outside of it.\n\nUsers can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements.\n\n\n\n\n### Disability profiles supported in our website\n\n  * **Epilepsy Safe Mode:** this profile enables people with epilepsy to use the website safely by eliminating the risk of seizures that result from flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.\n  * **Visually Impaired Mode:** this mode adjusts the website for the convenience of users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataract, Glaucoma, and others.\n  * **Cognitive Disability Mode:** this mode provides different assistive options to help users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, to focus on the essential elements of the website more easily.\n  * **ADHD Friendly Mode:** this mode helps users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders to read, browse, and focus on the main website elements more easily while significantly reducing distractions.\n  * **Blindness Mode:** this mode configures the website to be compatible with screen-readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack. A screen-reader is software for blind users that is installed on a computer and smartphone, and websites must be compatible with it.\n  * **Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired):** this profile enables motor-impaired persons to operate the website using the keyboard Tab, Shift+Tab, and the Enter keys. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements.\n\n\n\n### Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments\n\n  1. **Font adjustments –** users, can increase and decrease its size, change its family (type), adjust the spacing, alignment, line height, and more.\n  2. **Color adjustments –** users can select various color contrast profiles such as light, dark, inverted, and monochrome. Additionally, users can swap color schemes of titles, texts, and backgrounds, with over 7 different coloring options.\n  3. **Animations –** epileptic users can stop all running animations with the click of a button. Animations controlled by the interface include videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions.\n  4. **Content highlighting –** users can choose to emphasize important elements such as links and titles. They can also choose to highlight focused or hovered elements only.\n  5. **Audio muting –** users with hearing devices may experience headaches or other issues due to automatic audio playing. This option lets users mute the entire website instantly.\n  6. **Cognitive disorders –** we utilize a search engine that is linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing people with cognitive disorders to decipher meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and others.\n  7. **Additional functions –** we provide users the option to change cursor color and size, use a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and many other functions.\n\n\n\n### Browser and assistive technology compatibility\n\nWe aim to support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS and NVDA (screen readers), both for Windows and for MAC users.\n\n### Notes, comments, and feedback\n\nDespite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating and improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility, following technological advancements. For any assistance, please reach out to \n"

Accessibility Statement\n\n## Accessibility Statement\n\n  * www.adial.com\n  * November 29, 2024\n\n\n\n### Compliance status\n\nWe firmly believe that the internet should be available and accessible to anyone, and are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of circumstance and ability.\n\nTo fulfill this, we aim to adhere as strictly as possible to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that the website is accessible to all people: blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment, cognitive disabilities, and more.\n\nThis website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as accessible as possible at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the website’s UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs.\n\nAdditionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level constantly. This application remediates the website’s HTML, adapts Its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by the blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments.\n\nIf you’ve found a malfunction or have ideas for improvement, we’ll be happy to hear from you. You can reach out to the website’s operators by using the following email \n\n### Screen-reader and keyboard navigation\n\nOur website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various different behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with screen-readers are able to read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements, alongside console screenshots of code examples:\n\n  1. **Screen-reader optimization:** we run a background process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website. In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels; descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others. Additionally, the background process scans all of the website’s images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described. It will also extract texts that are embedded within the image, using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website.\n\nThese adjustments are compatible with all popular screen readers, including JAWS and NVDA.\n\n  2. **Keyboard navigation optimization:** The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML, and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus, available at any time by clicking Alt+1, or as the first elements of the site while navigating with the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and not allow the focus drift outside of it.\n\nUsers can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements.\n\n\n\n\n### Disability profiles supported in our website\n\n  * **Epilepsy Safe Mode:** this profile enables people with epilepsy to use the website safely by eliminating the risk of seizures that result from flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.\n  * **Visually Impaired Mode:** this mode adjusts the website for the convenience of users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataract, Glaucoma, and others.\n  * **Cognitive Disability Mode:** this mode provides different assistive options to help users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, to focus on the essential elements of the website more easily.\n  * **ADHD Friendly Mode:** this mode helps users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders to read, browse, and focus on the main website elements more easily while significantly reducing distractions.\n  * **Blindness Mode:** this mode configures the website to be compatible with screen-readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack. A screen-reader is software for blind users that is installed on a computer and smartphone, and websites must be compatible with it.\n  * **Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired):** this profile enables motor-impaired persons to operate the website using the keyboard Tab, Shift+Tab, and the Enter keys. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements.\n\n\n\n### Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments\n\n  1. **Font adjustments –** users, can increase and decrease its size, change its family (type), adjust the spacing, alignment, line height, and more.\n  2. **Color adjustments –** users can select various color contrast profiles such as light, dark, inverted, and monochrome. Additionally, users can swap color schemes of titles, texts, and backgrounds, with over 7 different coloring options.\n  3. **Animations –** epileptic users can stop all running animations with the click of a button. Animations controlled by the interface include videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions.\n  4. **Content highlighting –** users can choose to emphasize important elements such as links and titles. They can also choose to highlight focused or hovered elements only.\n  5. **Audio muting –** users with hearing devices may experience headaches or other issues due to automatic audio playing. This option lets users mute the entire website instantly.\n  6. **Cognitive disorders –** we utilize a search engine that is linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing people with cognitive disorders to decipher meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and others.\n  7. **Additional functions –** we provide users the option to change cursor color and size, use a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and many other functions.\n\n\n\n### Browser and assistive technology compatibility\n\nWe aim to support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS and NVDA (screen readers), both for Windows and for MAC users.\n\n### Notes, comments, and feedback\n\nDespite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating and improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility, following technological advancements. For any assistance, please reach out to \n"

To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website.\n\nThese adjustments are compatible with all popular screen readers, including JAWS and NVDA.\n\n  2. **Keyboard navigation optimization:** The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML, and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus, available at any time by clicking Alt+1, or as the first elements of the site while navigating with the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and not allow the focus drift outside of it.\n\nUsers can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements.\n\n\n\n\n### Disability profiles supported in our website\n\n  * **Epilepsy Safe Mode:** this profile enables people with epilepsy to use the website safely by eliminating the risk of seizures that result from flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.\n  * **Visually Impaired Mode:** this mode adjusts the website for the convenience of users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataract, Glaucoma, and others.\n  * **Cognitive Disability Mode:** this mode provides different assistive options to help users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, to focus on the essential elements of the website more easily.\n  * **ADHD Friendly Mode:** this mode helps users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders to read, browse, and focus on the main website elements more easily while significantly reducing distractions.\n  * **Blindness Mode:** this mode configures the website to be compatible with screen-readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack. A screen-reader is software for blind users that is installed on a computer and smartphone, and websites must be compatible with it.\n  * **Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired):** this profile enables motor-impaired persons to operate the website using the keyboard Tab, Shift+Tab, and the Enter keys. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements.\n\n\n\n### Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments\n\n  1. **Font adjustments –** users, can increase and decrease its size, change its family (type), adjust the spacing, alignment, line height, and more.\n  2. **Color adjustments –** users can select various color contrast profiles such as light, dark, inverted, and monochrome. Additionally, users can swap color schemes of titles, texts, and backgrounds, with over 7 different coloring options.\n  3. **Animations –** epileptic users can stop all running animations with the click of a button. Animations controlled by the interface include videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions.\n  4. **Content highlighting –** users can choose to emphasize important elements such as links and titles. They can also choose to highlight focused or hovered elements only.\n  5. **Audio muting –** users with hearing devices may experience headaches or other issues due to automatic audio playing. This option lets users mute the entire website instantly.\n  6. **Cognitive disorders –** we utilize a search engine that is linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing people with cognitive disorders to decipher meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and others.\n  7. **Additional functions –** we provide users the option to change cursor color and size, use a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and many other functions.\n\n\n\n### Browser and assistive technology compatibility\n\nWe aim to support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS and NVDA (screen readers), both for Windows and for MAC users.\n\n### Notes, comments, and feedback\n\nDespite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating and improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility, following technological advancements. For any assistance, please reach out to \n"

statements.\n4\nADIAL PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nAdial Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Adial”) was converted from a limited liability company formed on November 23, 2010 in the Commonwealth of Virginia under the name ADial\nPharmaceuticals, LLC, to a corporation and reincorporated in Delaware on October 1, 2017. Adial is presently engaged in the development of medications for the treatment or\nprevention of addictions and related disorders.\nAdial’s wholly owned subsidiary, Purnovate, Inc. (\"Purnovate”), was formed on January 26, 2021 to acquire Purnovate, LLC, an entity formed in December of 2019.\nPurnovate was a drug development company with a platform focused on developing drug candidates for non-opioid pain reduction and other diseases and disorders potentially\ntargeted with adenosine analogs that are selective, potent, stable, and soluble. On January 27, 2023, the Company entered into an option agreement for the acquisition of\nPurnovate’s assets and business with Adovate, LLC (\"Adovate”), a Virginia limited liability company that was formed and majority owned by a then director of the Company and\nthen CEO of Purnovate and that was therefore a related party. On May 8, 2023, Adovate sent a letter to the Company exercising its option effective May 16, 2023 for the purchase\nof the assets and business of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Purnovate and made payment of the $450,000 in fees due on exercise. Effective June 30, 2023, Adovate\nissued to the Company the equity stake in Adovate due on exercise of the option agreement. On August 17, 2023, a Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption Agreement (\"Bill of\nSale”) was executed between Purnovate and Adovate, transferring the Purnovate assets to Adovate, effective as of June 30, 2023. On August 17, 2023, Purnovate and Adovate\nalso entered into a Letter Agreement which stated that Adovate acquired the assets of Purnovate effective as of June 30, 2023, pursuant to the Bill of Sale. On September 18, 2023,\nthe parties executed a final acquisition agreement which memorialized the terms of the sale of the Purnovate assets to Adovate pursuant to the Option Agreement and Bill of Sale.\nSee Note 4 for additional information.\nIn July of 2022, the Company released data from its ONWARD™ Phase 3 pivotal trial of its compound AD04 (\"AD04”) for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder. The U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration (\"FDA”) has indicated they will accept heavy-drinking-day based endpoints as a basis for approval for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder\nrather than the previously required abstinence-based endpoints. Key patents have been issued in the United States, the European Union, and other jurisdictions for which the\nCompany has exclusive license rights. The active ingredient in AD04 is ondansetron, a serotonin-3 antagonist. Due to its mechanism of action, AD04 has the potential to be used\nfor the treatment of other addictive disorders, such as Opioid Use Disorder, obesity, smoking, and other drug addictions.\n2 — GOING CONCERN AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (\"GAAP”), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company is in a development stage and has incurred losses each year since\ninception. Based on the current development plans for AD04 in both the U.S. and international markets and other operating requirements, the Company does not believe that the\nexisting cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months following the filing of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements. The Company has a significant accumulated deficit, incurred recurring losses, and needs to raise additional funds to sustain its operations. These factors raise\nsubstantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nBased on the recently announced results of its ONWARD Phase 3 trial, the Company has completed and publicly reported meetings with the FDA and various European\nnational authorities to discuss the appropriate next steps towards the expeditious development of AD04 and to seek product approval. The Company has sold its Purnovate\nprograms to a company formed for that purpose, reducing the Company’s operating expenses. In March of 2024, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $3.8 million\nfrom the exercise of warrants. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received an additional $4 million in net proceeds from exercise of an at-the-market\nsales agreement. The Company will nonetheless require additional capital to continue operating and development of AD04. There is no certainty that the Company will be able to\naccess additional capital on acceptable terms, if at all, to continue operations after whatever funds are received from the buyer are expended. If unable to access sufficient capital,\nthe Company would be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs or delay its approach to commercialization of AD04, which\nwould likely have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial statements.\n5\nOther Uncertainties\nGenerally, the industry in which the Company operates subjects the Company to a number of other risks and uncertainties that can affect its operating results and\nfinancial condition. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the timing, costs and results of clinical trials and other development activities versus expectations; the ability to\nobtain regulatory approval to market product candidates; the ability to manufacture products successfully; competition from products sold or being developed by other\ncompanies; the price of, reimbursement of, and demand for, Company products once approved; the ability to negotiate favorable licensing or other manufacturing and marketing\nagreements for its products.\n3 — BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires Company management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of these consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Actual results might differ from these estimates.\nSignificant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include accruals associated with third party providers supporting clinical trials and income tax asset\nrealization.\nBasis of Presentation and Principals of Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP as determined by the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board (\"FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q of Regulation S-X.\nAccordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, these unaudited interim\ncondensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the balances and results\nof operations for the periods presented. The interim operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any subsequent period. These unaudited\ncondensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in the 2023 Form 10-K, filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements represent the consolidation of the Company and its\nsubsidiary in conformity with GAAP. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn August 4, 2023, the Company effected a reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock, trading on Nasdaq under the symbol ADIL, at a ratio of 1-for-\n25. The shares authorized for issue under the Company’s charter remained 50,000,000 shares common stock. All references to common stock, stock warrants to purchase common\nstock, stock options to purchase common stock, share data, per share data and related information contained in these unaudited condensed financial statements have been\nretrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of the reverse stock split for all periods presented.\nBasic and Diluted Loss per Share\nBasic and diluted loss per share are computed based on the weighted-average outstanding shares of common stock, which are all voting shares. Diluted net loss per share\nis computed giving effect to all proportional shares of common stock, including stock options, restricted stock, and warrants to the extent dilutive. Basic net loss per share was the\nsame as diluted net loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would have an anti-dilutive\neffect.\n6\nThe total potentially dilutive common shares that were excluded for the three and nine months periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nPotentially Dilutive\nCommon Shares\nOutstanding\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nWarrants to purchase common shares 4,201,568 329,022\nCommon Shares issuable on exercise of options 343,971 204,059\nUnvested restricted stock awards 16,662 26,667\nTotal potentially dilutive Common Shares excluded 4,562,201 559,748\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At times, the Company’s cash balances may\nexceed the current insured amounts under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At September 30, 2024, the Company exceeded FDIC insurance limits in its bank accounts by\n$447 thousand and held approximately $4.5 million in non-FDIC insured cash equivalent accounts. Included in cash equivalents are money market investments with original\nmaturity dates when purchased less than ninety days and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gain or loss are included in the interest income and are immaterial to the financial\nstatements. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s cash balances exceeded FDIC insurance limits by approximately $927,000 and the Company held approximately $1.6 million in\nnon-FDIC insured cash equivalent accounts.\nEquity Method Investments\nThe Company utilizes the equity method to account for investments when it possesses the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and\nfinancial decisions of the investee.\nEquity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus the Company’s proportionate share of the equity method investee’s operating\nincome or loss and plus or minus the Company’s proportionate share of dilution to buyers of newly issued equity. The proportionate share of the income or loss from equity\nmethod investments is recognized on a one quarter lag.\nCurrently, the Company is not obligated to make additional capital contributions for its equity method investments and therefore only records losses up to the amount of\nits total investment, inclusive of any other investments in and loans to the investee, which are not accounted for as equity method investments.\nWarrants\nThe Company accounts for stock warrants as either equity instruments, derivative liabilities, or liabilities in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from\nEquity (\"ASC 480”) and ASC 815-40 Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (\"ASC 815-40”), depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement.\nFair Value Measurements\nFASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, (\"ASC 820”) defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The methodology establishes consistency and comparability by providing a fair value hierarchy that\nprioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques into three broad levels, which are described below:\n● Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (these are observable market inputs).\n● Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability (includes quoted market prices for similar assets\nor identical or similar assets in markets in which there are few transactions, prices that are not current or prices that vary substantially).\n● Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect the entity’s own assumptions in pricing the asset or liability (used when little or no market data is available).\n7\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximate their carrying value due to their short-term maturities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This Update improves reportable\nsegment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted. The Company is in the\nprocess of evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This Update enhances the transparency and\nusefulness of income tax disclosures, particularly in the rate reconciliation table and disclosures about income taxes paid. The guidance also eliminates certain existing\nrequirements related to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. The amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December\n15, 2024. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of\nthis new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\n4 — DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nThe business of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Purnovate, was sold during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Due to the timing and\navailability of Adovate’s financial information, the Company is recording its proportionate share of losses from Adovate on a one quarter lag basis. Adovate’s summary balance\nsheet information as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 is below:\nJune 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\nCurrent Assets $ 1,370,586 $ 524,318\nNon-current assets $ 3,805,961 $ 3,368,533\nCurrent liabilities $ 322,173 $ 813,371\nNon-current liabilities $ 454,905 $ 521,592\nResults for Adovate’s operations in the nine months ended June 30, 2024 are summarized below:\nRevenues $ —\nCosts and expenses (1,916,325)\nLoss from operations (1,916,325)\nOther expenses (6,787)\nNet loss $ (1,923,112)\nIn January of 2024, in accordance with the Company’s agreement with Adovate, the Company’s equity share in Adovate was reduced to 15% on Adovate’s meeting of\ncertain financing thresholds. At that time, the value of the equity method investment was reduced by $283,268.\nThe Company held a weighted average of 16.55% of Adovate’s equity during the nine months ended June 30, 2024. The Company recognized an expense of $326,024,\nclassified as other income (expense), against the carrying amount of the equity method investment, representing the Company’s portion of Adovate operating loss for the nine\nmonths ended June 30, 2024.

The Company is required to pay compensation to the UVA LVG, as described in Note 9. A certain percentage of these payments by the\nCompany to the UVA LVG may then be distributed to the Company’s former Chairman of the Board and former Chief Medical Officer in his capacity as inventor of the patents by\nthe UVA LVG in accordance with their policies at the time.\nOn July 1, 2023, the Company executed a shared services agreement with Adovate, Inc., in which the Company holds a significant equity stake (see Note 5), for sharing of\nthe efforts of certain Adovate employee time and use of Adovate office space and equipment.

This agreement constituted a standby equity purchase\nagreement (a \"SEPA”). Pursuant to the SEPA, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Alumni up to $3,000,000 of newly issued shares, subject to increase to\n$10,000,000 at the option of the Company, at the Company’s request at any time during the commitment period, which commenced on May 31, 2023 and will end on the earlier of (i)\nDecember 31, 2024, or (ii) the date on which Alumni shall have made payment of advances requested by the Company totaling up to the commitment amount of $3,000,000.

The SEPA provides for shares to be sold to Alumni at 95% of the lowest daily volume weighted\naverage price during the three days after a Purchase Notice is issued to Alumni. The Company determined that the SEPA contains put option elements and forward share issuance\nelements that fail to meet equity classification under ASC 815-40, Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity; the put option is recorded at fair value at inception and each reporting date\nthereafter. Forward contracts to issue shares created on the occurrence of a Purchase Notice will be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net loss upon\nclosing of the Purchase Notice and sale of the Company’s stock.\nUpon the Company’s entry into and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the SEPA, 7,983 shares of common stock were issued to Alumni as consideration for\nits irrevocable commitment to purchase shares of common stock, pursuant to the SEPA, as shown in the consolidated statement of shareholders’ equity.

The aggregate market value of the shares of Common Stock eligible for sale under the\nATM Prospectus Supplement was $4,283,650 which is based on the limitations of such offerings under SEC regulations. The Company recognized $77,600 in expenses associated\nwith the conclusion the ATM Agreement, which expenses were classified as cost of capital.\nThe ATM Agreement provides that the Company will pay the Sales Agent commissions for its services in acting as agent in the sale of shares of Common Stock pursuant\nto the ATM Agreement. The Sales Agent will be entitled to compensation at a fixed commission rate of 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock\npursuant to the ATM Agreement.

More specifically, the Company paid UVA LVG a license issue fee and is obligated to pay UVA LVG (i)\nannual minimum royalties of $40,000 commencing in 2017; (ii) a $20,000 milestone payments upon dosing the first patient under a Phase 3 human clinical trial of a licensed product,\n$155,000 upon the earlier of the completion of a Phase 3 trial of a licensed product, partnering of a licensed product, or sale of the Company, $275,000 upon acceptance of a New\nDrug Application by the FDA, and $1,000,000 upon approval for sale of AD04 in the U.S., Europe or Japan; as well as (iii) royalties equal to a 2% and 1% of net sales of licensed\nproducts in countries in which a valid patent exists or does not exist, respectively, with royalties paid quarterly. In the event of a sublicense to a third party, the Company is\nobligated to pay royalties to UVA LVG equal to a percentage of what the Company would have been required to pay to UVA LVG had it sold the products under sublicense itself.\nIn addition, the Company is required to pay to UVA LVG 15% of any sublicensing income. A certain percentage of these payments by the Company to UVA LVG may then be\ndistributed to the Company’s former Chairman of the Board and former Chief Medical Officer in his capacity as inventor of the patents by the UVA LVG in accordance with their\npolicies at the time.\n13\nThe license agreement may be terminated by UVA LVG upon sixty (60) days written notice if the Company breaches its obligations thereunder, including failing to make\nany milestone, failure to make required payments, or the failure to exercise diligence to bring licensed products to market. In the event of a termination, the Company will be\nobligated to pay all amounts that accrued prior to such termination. The Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve the goals of submitting a New Drug\nApplication to the FDA for a licensed product by March 31, 2028 and commencing commercialization of an FDA approved product by March 31, 2029. If the Company were to fail\nto use commercially reasonable effort and fail to meet either goal, the licensor would have the right to terminate the license.\nThe term of the license continues until the expiration, abandonment or invalidation of all licensed patents and patent applications, and following any such expiration,\nabandonment or invalidation will continue in perpetuity on a royalty-free, fully paid basis.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a $30,000 minimum license royalty expense under this agreement. However, on July 1, 2024,\nUVA LVG issued a credit of $20,000 to the Company for license fees previously billed in error, which the Company credited against accrued expenses, resulting in a net accrual\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of $10,000. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized a $30,000 minimum license royalty\nexpense under this agreement. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, total accrued royalties and fees due to UVA LVG were $10,000 and $30,000, respectively, shown on balance sheet as\naccrued expenses, related party.\nSee Note 10 for an amendment to the license agreement between the Company and UVA LVG.\nGrant Incentive Plan – Related Party\nOn April 1, 2018, the board of directors approved and then revised, respectively, a grant incentive plan to provide incentive for Bankole A.

Johnson, who at the time of the agreement was\nserving as the Chairman of the Board of Directors, for his service as Chief Medical Officer of the Company. The Consulting Agreement had a term of three years, unless terminated\nby mutual consent or by the Company for cause. Dr. Johnson resigned as Chairman of the Board of Directors at the time of execution of the Consulting Agreement. Under the\nterms of the Consulting Agreement, Dr. Johnson’s annual fee of $375,000 per year is paid twice per month. On September 8, 2022, Dr. Johnson’s Consulting Agreement was\namended to increase his annual compensation to $430,000 annually and to pay him series of bonuses in cash and shares on the occurrence of certain milestones. The Company\nrecognized zero dollars and $181,205 in compensation expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and recognized $108,750 and $326,250 in\ncompensation expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, as a result of the Consulting Agreement.\nOn April 10, 2024, the Company provided Dr. Johnson with notice of the termination of the Company’s consulting agreement with him. As a result of the termination of the\nConsulting Agreement, effective as of May 17, 2024, Dr. Johnson ceased serving as the Company’s Chief Medical Officer. On April 24, 2024, the Company and Dr. Johnson\nexecuted a separation agreement providing for Dr. Johnson’s continued service as a consultant on an hourly basis as needed, a separation payment of $56,792, and for certain\npayments on the occurrence of milestones. In June of 2024, the Company determined that Dr. Johnson had achieved milestones making due to him payments of $40,000, which\npayment was made on August 20, 2024. On August 18, 2024, the Company issued 2,400 shares of common stock to Dr. Johnson on achievement of certain milestones as agreed\nunder the separation agreement at a cost of $0.98 cents per share, for a total cost of $2,352.\n14\nConsulting Agreement – Related Party\nOn October 24, 2022, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement (the \"MSA”) with Abuwala & Company, LLC, dba as Orbytel, for provision of strategic\nconsulting services. Orbytel made it known that it intended to utilize the services of the Keswick Group, LLC as a subcontractor in the provision of these services. Tony Goodman,\na director of Company, is the founder and principal of Keswick Group, LLC, therefore Orbytel was considered a related party. Statement of work #1 (\"SOW #1”), executed with the\nMSA, committed the Company to $209,250 in payments. The Company did not recognize any expense under SOW#1 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 During the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized the remaining $57,750 in expenses under SOW #1.\nConsulting Agreement – Related Party\nOn March 15, 2023, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement (the \"Keswick MSA”) with the Keswick Group, LLC for provision of consulting services.\nTony Goodman, a director, is the founder and principal of Keswick Group. Under the terms of the Keswick MSA, the Keswick Group is to be paid $22,000 per month for its services\nfor a period of one year from execution of the MSA. On January 17, 2024, the Company entered into a statement of work #2 (\"SOW #2”) with Tony Goodman and Keswick Group,\npursuant to which Mr. Goodman was appointed as Chief Operating Officer of Adial for compensation of $25,000 per month for the role of Chief Operating Officer including carry\nover duties from a previous statement of work #1. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $223,500 and $143,100 in expenses, respectively,\nassociated with this agreement.\nClinical Research Services Agreement\nOn May 9, 2024, the Company executed a statement of work with Dr. Vince Clinical Research, LLC for the performance of clinical research services for the Company. This\nstatement of work commits the Company to approximately $1,437,000 in payments, to be made on the occurrence of certain performance milestones. At September 30, 2024, the\nCompany had paid approximately $1,284,000 in milestone payments, of which approximately $1,280,000 had been earned and recognized as an expense, leaving the Company with a\nprepaid expense asset of $4,430. At September 30, 2024, the Company expected $147,123 in additional expenses to be recognized and $142,694 in cash payments to be made under\nthe terms of this agreement.\nOther Consulting and Vendor Agreements\nThe Company has entered into a number of agreements and work orders for future consulting, clinical trial support, and testing services, with terms ranging between 12\nand 36 months. These agreements, in aggregate, commit the Company to approximately $481 thousand in future cash.\nLitigation\nThe Company is subject, from time to time, to claims by third parties under various legal disputes. The defense of such claims, or any adverse outcome relating to any\nsuch claims, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity, financial condition, and cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any\npending legal actions.\n10 — SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn October 21, 2024, the Company’s license agreement with UVA LVG was amended to extend certain commercial milestone deadlines.\nOn November 12, 2024, the Company held its 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, at which the Company’s stockholders approved amendment of Company’s 2017\nEquity Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock that the Company will have authority to grant under the plan from 500,000 to 2,000,000. As a result of this\nincrease, the number of shares available for issue under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan was 2,018,165 at the date of this filing.\n15\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated. The\ndiscussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes presented herein included in this Form 10-Q and the audited\nfinancial statements and the other information set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that we filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024\n(the \"2023 Form 10-K”). ln addition to historical information, the following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\ncontains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those set forth below under \"Risk Factors” and elsewhere herein, and\nthose identified under Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result\nof certain factors discussed herein and any other periodic reports filed and to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC”).\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapeutics for the treatment or prevention of addiction and related disorders. Our\ninvestigational new drug candidate, AD04, is being developed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (\"AUD”). AD04 was recently investigated in a Phase\n3 clinical trial, designated the ONWARD trial, for the potential treatment of AUD in subjects with certain target genotypes, which were identified using our companion diagnostic\ngenetic test. Based on our analysis of the subgroup data from the ONWARD trial, we are now focused on completing the clinical development program for AD04 in the specified\ngenetic subgroups to meet regulatory requirements primarily in the US and secondarily in Europe/UK.\nIn January 2021, we expanded our portfolio in the field of addiction with the acquisition of Purnovate, LLC via a merger into our wholly owned subsidiary, Purnovate, Inc.\n(\"Purnovate”) and in January 2023, we entered into an option agreement with Adovate LLC (\"Adovate”), pursuant to which we granted to Adovate an exclusive option for\nAdovate or its designated affiliate to acquire all of the assets of Purnovate and to assume related liabilities and expenses. (Our then-CEO was a significant equity holder in\nPurnovate, LLC, so this was considered a related party transaction.) On May 8, 2023, Adovate sent a letter exercising its option effective May 16, 2023 and made payment of the\n$450,000 in fees due on exercise. Effective June 30, 2023, Adovate issued to us the equity stake in Adovate due on exercise of the option agreement. On August 17, 2023, a Bill of\nSale, Assignment and Assumption Agreement (\"Bill of Sale”) was executed between Purnovate and Adovate, transferring the Purnovate assets to Adovate, effective as of June 30,\n2023. On August 17, 2023, Purnovate and Adovate also entered into a letter agreement acknowledging that Adovate acquired the assets of Purnovate effective as of June 30, 2023,\npursuant to the Bill of Sale.\nWe have devoted the vast majority of our resources to development efforts relating to AD04, including preparation for and conducting clinical trials, providing general and\nadministrative support for these operations and protecting our intellectual property. We expect these activities to continue to demand most of our resources for the foreseeable\nfuture.\nWe currently do not have any products approved for sale and we have not generated any significant revenue since our inception. From our inception through the date of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have funded our operations primarily through the private and public placements of debt, equity securities, and an equity line.\nOur current cash and cash equivalents are not expected to be sufficient to fund operations for the twelve months from the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, based\non our current commitments and development plans.\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of approximately $11.1 million and $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\nyear ended December 31, 2023, respectively. We had accumulated deficits of approximately $79.9 million and $68.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. All of our operating losses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from costs incurred in continuing operations, including costs in connection with our\ncontinuing research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 also includes uncapitalized financing costs, such as the cost of issuing new warrants to induce a holder to exercise existing warrants.\nWe will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for AD04, which we expect will take a\nnumber of years and is subject to significant uncertainty. We do not believe our current cash and equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months\nfrom the filing of these financial statements.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, we expect to finance our operating activities through a combination of equity offerings, debt\nfinancings, government or other third-party funding, commercialization, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing\narrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or\nenter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop AD04.\n16\nRecent Developments\nFinancial Developments\nOn March 1, 2024, we entered into a warrant inducement agreement (the \"Inducement Agreement”) with a certain holder (the \"Holder”) of our warrants (the \"Existing Warrants”) to\npurchase shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \"common stock”), issued in a private placement offering that closed on October 24, 2023. Pursuant to the\nInducement Agreement, the Holder of the Existing Warrants agreed to exercise for cash the Existing Warrants to purchase up to approximately 1,150,000 shares of common stock,\nat an exercise price of $2.82 per share. The transactions contemplated by the Inducement Agreement closed on March 6, 2024. We received aggregate gross proceeds of\napproximately $3.5 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other expenses payable by us. Net proceeds of this transaction were approximately $3.1 million.\nIn consideration of the Holder’s immediate exercise of the Existing Warrants and the payment of $0.125 per New Warrant (as such term is defined below) in accordance with the\nInducement Agreement, we issued unregistered Series C Warrants (the \"New Warrants”) to purchase 2,300,000 shares of common stock (200% of the number of shares of common\nstock issued upon exercise of the Existing Warrants) (the \"New Warrant Shares”) to the Holder of Existing Warrants.\nOn March 1, 2024, warrants to purchase 268,440 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.82 per share were exercised for gross proceeds of\napproximately $757 thousand.\nOn April 18, 2024, we entered into an At the Market Offering Agreement (the \"ATM Agreement”) with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (the \"Sales Agent” or \"Wainwright”) providing\nfor sale of our shares of common stock, from time to time, through the Sales Agent, with certain limitations on the number of shares of common stock that may be offered and sold\nby us as set forth in the ATM Agreement. The aggregate market value of the shares of Common Stock eligible for sale under the ATM prospectus supplement filed in connection\nwith the ATM Agreement was $4,283,650 which is based on the limitations of such offerings under SEC regulations. The ATM Agreement provides that we will pay the Sales\nAgent commissions for its services in acting as agent in the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement. The Sales Agent will be entitled to compensation at\na fixed commission rate of 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement. The offering of shares of common stock pursuant\nto the ATM Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the sale of all shares of common stock subject to the ATM Agreement; or (ii) termination of the ATM Agreement by us\nas permitted therein. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used this ATM Agreement to sell 2,348,520 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately\n$4 million, after fees and expenses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 2,109,700 shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement for net proceeds of\napproximately $3.8 million.\nResults of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (rounded to nearest thousand)\nThe following table sets forth the components of our statements of operations in dollars for the periods presented:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n2024 2023 (Decrease)\nResearch and development expenses $ 1,032,000 $ 207,000 $ 825,000\nGeneral and administrative expenses 1,180,000 1,151,000 29,000\nTotal Operating Expenses 2,212,000 1,358,000 854,000\nLoss From Operations (2,212,000) (1,358,000) (854,000)\nChange in value of equity method investment (31,000) — (31,000)\nInterest income 51,000 10,000 41,000\nTotal other income (expenses) 20,000 10,000 (10,000)\nLoss from continuing operations $ (2,192,000) (1,348,000) (844,000)\nLoss from discontinued operations, net of tax — (37,000) 37,000\nNet loss (2,192,000) (1,385,000) (807,000)\n17\nResearch and development (\"R&D”) expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by approximately $825,000 (399%) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The key drivers of the increase were direct clinical trial expenses associated with the Phase 1b trial, which increased by approximately $771,000, the bulk of trial\nactivities taking place in the third quarter of 2024, and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) expenses which increased by approximately $204,000, as stability testing took\nplace to support the Phase 1b trial in 2024. These increases were partially offset by modest decreases in license royalty expense of $60,000, and decreases of approximately $52,000\nin the salaries of R&D personnel and of approximately $12,000 in equity-based compensation of R&D personnel.\nGeneral and administrative expenses (\"G&A”) expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $29,000 (3%) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September\n30, 2023. This modest increase was the sum of many small changes, the larger of which were increased direct patent expenses of approximately $45,000, increased investor and\npublic relations expenses of approximately $42,000. These increases were somewhat offset by decreased compensation of G&A directed employees of approximately $45,000, along\nwith a number of smaller decreased expense categories.\nLosses from Equity Method Investment\nThe expense recognized to the change in the value of our equity method investment in Adovate, LLC increased by approximately $31,000 in the three months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is entirely due to the fact that this investment was only acquired on June 30 of 2023, with changes to\nthe value of our Adovate equity recognized on a three month lag.\nTotal Other income (expenses)\nTotal other income, excluding losses from the equity method investment, increased by approximately $41,000 (410%) in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was entirely due to the increase in interest income that came from a substantial higher working cash balance held in the\nperiod.\nGain from discontinued operations, net of tax\nThe loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased by approximately $37,000 (100%) in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This decrease is wholly due to the fact that the business of Purnovate, Inc., the activities of which are now classified as discontinued, was sold in June of 2023\nand all activity ceased, with the last, residual expenses associated with the business being recognized in September of 2023.\nResults of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (rounded to nearest thousand)\nThe following table sets forth the components of our statements of operations in dollars for the periods presented:\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n2024 2023 (Decrease)\nResearch and development expenses $ 2,498,000 $ 1,003,000 $ 1,495,000\nGeneral and administrative expenses 3,845,000 4,101,000 (256,000)\nTotal Operating Expenses 6,343,000 5,104,000 1,239,000\nLoss From Operations (6,343,000) (5,104,000) (1,239,000)\nInducement expense (4,464,000) — (4,464,000)\nChange in value of equity method investment (443,000) — (443,000)\nInterest income 125,000 59,000 66,000\nOther expense (1,000) (52,000) 51,000\nTotal other income (expenses) (4,783,000) 7,000 (4,790,000)\nLoss from continuing operations $ (11,126,000) $ (5,097,000) $ (6,029,000)\nGain (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax — 1,894,000 (1,894,000)\nNet loss (11,126,000) (3,203,000) 7,923,000\n18\nResearch and development (\"R&D”) expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by approximately $1,495,000 (149%) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The key drivers of this increase were direct clinical trial expenses associated with the Phase 1b trial initiated in 2024, which increased by approximately\n$1,273,000, the conduct of was initiated and took place in 2024, and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) expenses which increased by approximately $291,000, as stability\ntesting took place to support the Phase 1b trial in 2024. These increases were amplified by added use of regulatory and product development strategic consultants for increased\nexpense of approximately $29,000 and increases of approximately $24,000 in the salaries of R&D personnel, partially offset by an approximately $137,000 reduction in equity-based\ncompensation of R&D personnel, which in 2023 included both options expense and bonuses paid in the form of stock.\nGeneral and administrative expenses (\"G&A”) expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $256,000 (6%) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September\n30, 2023. This decrease was the result of lower corporate legal expense of approximately $100,000, lower insurance premiums of approximately $45,000, and a decrease in\ncompensation of G&A directed employees of approximately $140000. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in investor and public relations expenses of\napproximately $35,000.\nLosses from Equity Method Investment\nThe expense recognized to the change in the value of our equity method investment in Adovate, LLC increased by approximately $443,000 in the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is entirely due to the fact that this investment was only acquired on June 30 of 2023, with changes to\nthe value of our Adovate equity recognized on a three month lag.\nInducement Expense\nThe inducement expense of approximately $4,464,000 which was a one time, noncash expense associated with the issuance of new warrants to induce the exercise of outstanding\nwarrants which occurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nTotal Other income (expenses)\nTotal other income, excluding losses from the equity method investment and inducement expense, increased by $117,000 (1671%) in the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to two factors: the increase of approximately $66,000 in interest income that resulted from a higher\ncash balance held in the period, and a one time expense in the prior year period of approximately $52,000 related to issuing commitment shares on establishment of our standby\nequity purchase agreement.\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax\nThe gain from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased by approximately $1,894,000 (100%) in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This decrease is wholly due to the fact that the business of Purnovate, Inc., the activities of which are now classified as discontinued, was sold in June of 2023\nand all activity ceased.\n19\nLiquidity and Capital Resources at September 30, 2024\nOur principal liquidity needs have historically been working capital, R&D costs including clinical trials, patent costs and personnel costs. We expect these needs to continue to\nincrease in the near term as we engage in clinical trials and develop and eventually commercialize our compound, if approved by regulatory authorities. Over the next several years,\nwe expect to increase our R&D expenses as we undergo clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our lead product candidate. To date, we have funded our operations\nprimarily with the proceeds from our initial and secondary public offerings, sales pursuant to out ATM Agreement and, to a lesser extent, private placements and our equity line, as\nwell as other equity financings, warrant exercises, and the issuance of debt securities prior to that.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our primary sources of funding was the exercise of previously issued warrants and the use of our ATM Agreement.\nOn March 1, 2024, warrants to purchase 268,440 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.82 per share were exercised for gross proceeds of approximately $757 thousand.\nOn March 1, 2024, we entered into the Inducement Agreement pursuant to which the Holder of the Existing Warrants exercised for cash the Existing Warrants to purchase up to\napproximately 1,150,000 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $2.82 per share. The transactions contemplated by the Inducement Agreement closed on March 6, 2024 and\nwe received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $3.5 million, before deducting placement agent fees and other expenses payable by us. Net proceeds of this transaction\nwere approximately $3.1 million.\nIn the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 2,348,520 shares of common stock through our ATM agreement, for net proceeds of approximately $4 million after placement\nfees and expenses.\nWe have been using and will continue to use the additional $7.8 million in funding received from warrant exercises and sales of our common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement\nto accelerate the development of AD04.\nWe have initiated and nearly completed Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study of AD04 with an estimated total cost of approximately $1.4 million, of which approximately $1.2 million has\nbeen paid, with the remaining $200 thousand expected to be paid by the end of 2024. In addition, we plan to begin a Phase III study of AD04 in the second half of 2025, to complete\nproduction of sufficient drug product to carry out the study, and to begin the process of revalidation for our companion diagnostic to be included in our Phase III study. Were we\nto proceed with all these additional accelerated development plans without raising any additional funds, we would potentially expend our cash on hand by during the second\nquarter of 2025. However, management retains the ability to delay implementation of these plans and will not proceed without having first secured sufficient funding either through\na financing or a partnership agreement. If these additional accelerated development plans are not implemented, our cash on hand would be sufficient to fund our operations and\nmeet our existing commitments into the second half of 2025.\nIf we are successful in raising sufficient additional funds, under our accelerated development plans, we expect to use between approximately $13 million and $16 million in cash\nduring the twelve months ended September 30, 2025 for both AD04 development costs and general corporate expenses, of which between approximately $9 million and $12.0 million\nare contingent on our implementation of our accelerated development plans. Since implementation of our accelerated development plans would require the expenditure of our\ncurrent cash on hand by in the second quarter of 2025, we will not be able to fully implement our accelerated development plans without additional financing. We do not have any\nfixed commitments of financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able secure financing on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, there is no assurance that funds could\nbe raised on acceptable terms to continue our operations and AD04 development projects before we have expended our current cash on hand, even if we delay our accelerated\ndevelopment plans.\nWe will require additional financing as we continue to execute our overall business strategy, including two additional Phase 3 trials for AD04 that are currently expected to require\nan average of $8-12 million each in direct expenses, and up to $5 million in additional other development expenses. These estimates may change based on upcoming discussions\nwith regulatory authorities and final trial designs. Our liquidity may be negatively impacted as a result of research and development cost increases in addition to general economic\nand industry factors. Our continued operations will depend on our ability to raise additional capital through various potential sources, such as equity and/or debt financings, grant\nfunding, strategic relationships, or out-licensing in order to complete its subsequent clinical trial requirements for AD04. Management is actively pursuing financing and other\nstrategic plans but can provide no assurances that such financing or other strategic plans will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Without additional funding, we will be\nrequired to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, which would likely have a material adverse effect on us and our financial\nstatements.\n20\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or convertible debt, our shareholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed\npayment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital\nexpenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable\nrights to our products, future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We cannot be certain that additional funding\nwill be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any failure to raise capital in the future could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our\nbusiness strategies.\nCash flows\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(rounded to nearest thousand) 2024 2023\nProvided by (used in)\nOperating activities $ (5,468,000) (4,598,000)\nDiscontinued operations — (986,000)\nInvesting activities — 1,150,000\nFinancing activities 7,846,000 748,000\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 2,378,000 (3,686,000)\nNet cash used in operating activities – continuing operations\nNet cash used in operating activities increased by approximately $870,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe primary drivers of the increase were higher operating expenses of $1,240,000 and a decrease in equity compensation of $849,000, partially offset by the favorable increase of\n$1,150,000 in the net change in operating assets and liabilities when comparing the same two periods.\nNet cash used in discontinued operations\nNet cash used in discontinued operations decreased by approximately $986,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. This was entirely due to the completion of the sale of the discontinued operations in June of 2023, after which these operations ceased requiring the use of cash.\nNet cash provided by investing activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities decreased by approximately $1,150,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The decrease was driven by payments received in the prior year period related to the sale of Purnovate.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by approximately $7,846,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we engaged in a single limited sale of common stock to a single individual investor, whereas in the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we sold 2,348,520 shares of common stock through our ATM agreement for net proceeds of approximately $4,021,000 and realized additional funds from the\ninduced and uninduced exercise of additional warrants for net proceeds of approximately $3,824,000.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, if any.\n21\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial statements have\nbeen prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us\nto make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base\nour estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the\nbasis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results and experiences may differ\nmaterially from these estimates. We did not identify any critical accounting estimates. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to our financial\nstatements included with this report.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed\nunder the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of\nthe SEC. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of\ndeficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or\ndetected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified to date include (i) lack of formal risk assessment under COSO framework: (ii) policies and procedures which are not\nadequately documented; (iii) lack of proper approval processes, review processes and documentation for such reviews; (iv) insufficient GAAP experience regarding complex\ntransactions and ineffective review processes over period end financial disclosure and reporting; (v) deficiencies in the risk assessment, design and policies and procedures over\ninformation technology general controls; and (vi) insufficient segregation of duties.\nDue to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as described above, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that based on\ntheir evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.\nNotwithstanding the material weaknesses described above, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements, and other financial information included in this quarterly report, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results\nof operations, and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nRemediation Plan for Existing Material Weakness\nManagement continues to take steps to remediate the weaknesses described above. Management has engaged consulting services to ameliorate those material weaknesses\nstemming from its small number of personnel, in particular consultants with significant GAAP experience and IT security experts. Management is committed to additional\nremediation steps, including formal risk assessment, improved documentation of the Company’s controls, and redesign of inadequate approval processes, as resources permit. A\nformal risk assessment is underway and is expected to be complete by the end of 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere has been no change in our internal control procedures over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our\nfiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n22\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal\nproceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash\nflows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks, together with all the other information in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. If any of the following risks actually materializes, our operating results, financial\ncondition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your\ninvestment. The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the information disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,” contained in our 2023\nForm 10-K. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nWe have incurred losses from our continuing operations every year and quarter since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses from our continuing\noperations in the future.\nWe are a clinical stage biotechnology pharmaceutical company that is focused on the discovery and development of medications for the treatment of addictions and related\ndisorders of AUD in patients with certain targeted genotypes. We have a limited operating history. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative\nbecause it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effect or an acceptable safety\nprofile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to\ndate, and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. To date, we have not generated positive cash flow from\noperations, revenues, or profitable operations, nor do we expect to in the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $79.9 million\nand as of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $68.8 million. Our current cash and cash equivalents are not expected to be sufficient to fund\noperations for the twelve months from the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are only anticipated to be sufficient to fund our needs into the second half of 2025,\nbased our current projections and current commitments. Implementation of our full development plans would exhaust our cash on hand more quickly. Therefore, despite the\nfunding we have recently received, we will need to engage in additional fundraising in the near term as we carry out our development plans. We do not have any fixed commitments\nof financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the conditions for continued sales pursuant to the ATM Agreement. In addition, there is no assurance that\nfunds could be raised before we have expended our current cash on hand on acceptable terms to continue our operations and AD04 development projects.\nEven if we succeed in commercializing our product candidate or any future product candidates, we expect that the commercialization of our product will not begin until 2027 or later,\nwe will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market additional product candidates and will continue to incur substantial\nlosses and negative operating cash flow. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our\nbusiness. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected\nfuture losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our shareholders’ equity and working capital.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as do our notes to financial statements included in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm contains a note stating that the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue\nas a going concern. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of $11.1 million and used $5.5 million of cash in operations. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we incurred a net loss of $5.1 million and used cash in operations of $6.8 million. Losses have principally occurred as a result of the research and development\nefforts coupled with no operating revenue. The notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q state that we\ndo not believe that the existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nand our significant accumulated deficit, recurring losses, and needs to raise additional funds to sustain its operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern.\nEven if we succeed in commercializing our product candidate or any future product candidates, we expect that the commercialization of our product will not begin until 2026 or later,\nwe will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenditures to develop and market additional product candidates and will continue to incur substantial\nlosses and negative operating cash flow.\n23\nOne of our officers may have a conflict of interest.\nTwo of our officers are currently working for our company on a part-time basis and we expect that they will continue to do so. Our employment agreement with our Chief Financial\nOfficer provides that he will devote 75% of his business time to our matters, with his remaining business time devoted to other matters including, without limitation, employment at\nother companies that are non-competitive with us, which may result in a lack of availability when needed due to responsibilities with other requirements. Our agreement with our\nChief Operating Officer is that he will devote 75% of his business time to our matters, which may result in a lack of availability when needed due to responsibilities with other\nrequirements.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans and outstanding warrants, could result\nin additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital may be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including conducting clinical trials, commercialization efforts,\nexpanded research and development activities and costs associated with operating a public company. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other\nequity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities,\ninvestors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights,\npreferences and privileges senior to the holders of our common stock. Pursuant to our 2017 equity incentive plan, which became effective on the business day prior to the public\ntrading date of our common stock, our management is authorized to grant equity awards to our employees, officers, directors and consultants.\nInitially, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock that might be issued pursuant to stock awards under our 2017 equity incentive plan was 70,000 shares, which has\nbeen since increased to 500,000 at our 2023 Annual Stockholders Meeting, and of which 212,565 remain available for grant as of the date hereof. At our 2024 Annual Stockholders\nMeeting, our stockholders approved a proposal to increase the number of shares that we will have approval to grant under the 2017 equity incentive plan by 1,500,000 shares.\nIncreases in the number of shares available for future grant or purchase may result in additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nAt September 30, 2024 and as of the date of this filing, we had outstanding (i) warrants to purchase 4,201,568 shares of common stock outstanding with a weighted average exercise\nprice of $8.45, and (ii) options to purchase 343,971 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $21.98 per share. The issuance of the shares of common stock\nunderlying the options and warrants will have a dilutive effect on the percentage ownership held by holders of our common stock.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\n(a) Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nWe did not sell any equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 in transactions that were not registered under the Securities Act other than as disclosed in\nour filings with the SEC.\n(b) Use of Proceeds\nNot applicable.\n(c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nNot applicable.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a \"Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\n24\nItem 6.

Regulation FD Disclosure.\nOn November 14, 2024, Adial Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the \"Company”) issued a press release announcing that it has completed a pharmacokinetics (PK) study of AD04, the\nCompany’s lead investigational genetically targeted, serotonin-3 receptor antagonist, and therapeutic agent for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in heavy drinking\npatients (defined as less than 10 drinks/drinking day).\nThe study, a single-center, relative bioavailability, open label study, enrolled a total of 30 healthy adult volunteers in two cohorts. Cohort 1 (n=6) was a randomized, open-label, 2-\nsequence, 2-period crossover study to evaluate the PK variability of ondansetron from AD04 0.33 and 0.99mg. Cohort 2 (n=24) was a randomized, open-label, 6-sequence, 4-period\ncrossover study to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the AD04 0.33mg tablet to a marketed ondansetron 4mg tablet, dose proportionality of ondansetron PK between AD04\n0.33 and 0.99mg, and the effect of food on the bioavailability of ondansetron administered as the AD04 0.33mg tablet. The results of this study showed that, as a result of the lower\ndose, AD04 0.33mg delivered lower ondansetron PK exposure than the marketed reference standard ondansetron 4mg tablet; ondansetron pharmacokinetic exposure increased in\nproportion to dose across a 3-fold AD04 dose range; and AD04 can be taken in fed or fasted states.\nThis data is expected to help the Company optimize study design elements needed for the upcoming Phase 3 clinical trial of AD04.

(NASDAQ: ADIL) (\"Adial\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on\ndeveloping therapies for the treatment and prevention of addiction and related disorders, announced that it has completed a pharmacokinetics (PK) study of AD04, the Company's\nlead investigational genetically targeted, serotonin-3 receptor antagonist, and therapeutic agent for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in heavy drinking patients\n(defined as less than 10 drinks/drinking day). This data will help the Company optimize study design elements needed for the upcoming Phase 3 clinical trial of AD04. Completion\nof this study also satisfied an FDA requirement for the upcoming Phase 3 clinical trials of AD04.\nThe study, a single-center, relative bioavailability, open label study, enrolled a total of 30 healthy adult volunteers in two cohorts. Cohort 1 (n=6) was a randomized, open-label, 2-\nsequence, 2-period crossover study to evaluate the PK variability of ondansetron from AD04 0.33 and 0.99mg. Cohort 2 (n=24) was a randomized, open-label, 6-sequence, 4-period\ncrossover study to evaluate the relative bioavailability of the AD04 0.33mg tablet to a marketed ondansetron 4mg tablet, dose proportionality of ondansetron PK between AD04\n0.33 and 0.99mg, and the effect of food on the bioavailability of ondansetron administered as the AD04 0.33mg tablet. The results of this study showed that, as a result of the lower\ndose, AD04 0.33mg delivered lower ondansetron PK exposure than the marketed reference standard ondansetron 4mg tablet; ondansetron pharmacokinetic exposure increased in\nproportion to dose across a 3–fold AD04 dose range; and AD04 can be taken in fed or fasted states.\nCary Claiborne, President and Chief Executive Officer of Adial commented, \"Completion of this study achieves our goal to obtain the data we needed to design a more precise and\ninformed Phase 3 trial protocol, including evaluating the optimal dosing regimen to maximize the efficacy and safety of AD04 in patients with AUD. Its completion is in accord with\nprevious guidance provided by the FDA and is intended to enhance the likelihood of success in our upcoming Phase 3 trial. This relatively short and low-cost study was a key\nelement of our strategy to advance ongoing partnership discussions. Additionally, the study will provide data necessary to support an application for approval of AD04 under a\n505(b)(2) regulatory pathway with the FDA. We plan to engage with the FDA during Q4 2024 with the results of this pharmacokinetics study and obtain feedback which will assist\nwith the AD04 Phase 3 study program. This meeting is an important next step to further advancing AD04 towards regulatory approval.\"\nAbout AD04\nAD04 (0.33mg ondansetron taken orally twice daily) acts upon the 5HT3 pathway and is thought to reduce alcohol craving. This mode of action is distinct from, but complimentary\nto, the currently approved therapies for AUD. Post-hoc analyses of Adial's prior clinical studies have indicated that patients with mutations in the 5HT3 receptor experience\nsubstantial and clinically meaningful reductions in alcohol consumption. The specific mutations that appear to respond to AD04 are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on\nrs1150226-AG (\"AG\") or rs1176713-GG (\"GG\") genotypes in the gene that encodes the 5-HT3A receptor subunit. These genes are thought to affect the binding of AD04 to the\n5HT3 receptor and its function. Furthermore, in both previous clinical trials, AD04 had similar adverse events to placebo, which further supports that it is likely to be extremely safe\nand tolerable.\nAdial has already developed a companion diagnostic test (CDx) to identify the specific genotypes that benefit from AD04. This test was used in its Phase 3 ONWARD study, will\nbe used in future clinical studies, and will be commercially available at the time of AD04's launch.\nAbout Adial Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nAdial Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of treatments for addictions and related disorders. The Company's lead\ninvestigational new drug product, AD04, is a genetically targeted, serotonin-3 receptor antagonist, therapeutic agent for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in heavy\ndrinking patients and was recently investigated in the Company's ONWARD™ pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for the potential treatment of AUD in subjects with certain target\ngenotypes identified using the Company's companion diagnostic genetic test. ONWARD showed promising results in reducing drinking in heavy drinking patients, and no overt\nsafety or tolerability concerns. AD04 is also believed to have the potential to treat other addictive disorders such as Opioid Use Disorder, gambling, and obesity.
