Announces Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\n\nNov 12, 2024\n\nGURUGRAM, India & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Yatra Online, Inc. (NASDAQ: YTRA) (the “Company”), India’s leading corporate travel services provider and one of India’s leading online travel companies, today announced its unaudited financial and operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported revenue of INR 2,363.3 million (USD 28.2 million), reflecting a substantial year-over-year increase of 149.4%. Adjusted Air Ticketing Margins saw a 13.0% decline, primarily attributable to reduced volumes in the B2C segment as we strategically adjusted discounts to address intensified price competition. In contrast, our Adjusted Hotels and Packages margins improved significantly by 43.8% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in our MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) business. Adjusted EBITDA came in at INR 66.7 million (USD 0.8 million), a 91.2% increase from the prior year. \n\n“Despite headwinds in the B2C air segment, we continue to drive strong growth in our Hotels and Packages and MICE lines of businesses, which helped us more than offset the negative impact of the B2C air business. In the second quarter of FY25, we successfully secured 29 new corporate clients, adding an annual billing potential of INR 1,213.0 million (USD 14.5 million). \n\n“On September 11, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Globe All India Services (Globe Travels) for INR 1,280.0 million (USD 15.3 million) in cash. The results for the quarter include contribution from Globe Travels for 20 days of the quarter from September 11, 2024 - September 30, 2024. This strategic acquisition brought approximately 360 new corporate clients, further strengthening our leadership in India’s corporate travel sector. Globe Travels’ expertise in MICE complements our recent organic expansion in this segment, positioning Yatra as one of India’s largest players in this segment. With minimal overlap in client portfolios, this acquisition diversifies our client base and enhances cross-selling opportunities for hotels and expense management services. Additionally, integrating our digital booking platform with Globe Travel’s largely offline business is expected to drive synergies, operational efficiencies, and cost savings for our corporate clients. \n\n“Progress on corporate restructuring is also advancing as the Company continues to engage with its counsels and other stakeholders including certain regulators towards the formulation of a comprehensive multi-jurisdictional corporate restructuring that can reduce administrative overhead, rationalize costs, and facilitate the growth for the Company. We are encouraged by the strong momentum in our Corporate Travel business, underscored by our growth in new accounts and MICE capabilities. As we continue to navigate a dynamic market, our focus remains on executing our strategic priorities to reinforce our market leadership and drive long-term value for stakeholders.” - Dhruv Shringi, Co-founder and CEO. \n\n**Financial and operating highlights** for the three months ended September 30, 2024 **:**\n\n  * **Revenue** of INR 2,363.3 million (USD 28.2 million), representing an increase of 149.4% year-over-year basis (“YoY”). \n  * **Adjusted Margin(1)  from Air Ticketing ** of INR 885.9 million (USD 10.6 million), representing a decrease of 13.0% YoY. \n  * **Adjusted Margin(1)  from Hotels and Packages ** of INR 400.1 million (USD 4.8 million), representing an increase of 43.8% YoY. \n  * **Total Gross Bookings (Air Ticketing, Hotels and Packages and Other Services)(3) ** of INR 17,651.6 million (USD 210.7 million), representing an increase of 0.7% YoY. \n  * **Loss for the period** was INR 0.3 million (USD 0.1 million) versus a loss of INR 272.9 million (USD 3.3 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a decline in loss by INR 272.6 million (USD 3.3 million) YoY. \n  * **Result from operations** were a loss of INR 37.7 million (USD 0.4 million) versus a loss of INR 120.6 million (USD 1.4 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a decrease in loss by INR 82.9 million (USD 1.0 million) YoY. \n  * **Adjusted EBITDA(2)  ** was INR 66.7 million (USD 0.8 million) reflecting an increase by 91.2% YoY. \n\n**Three months ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2023** |  **2024** |  **2024**  \n**Unaudited** |  **Unaudited** |  **Unaudited** |  **YoY Change**  \n**(In thousands except percentages)** |  **INR** |  **INR** |  **USD** |  **%**  \n**Financial Summary as per IFRS**  \n**Revenue** |  **947,574** |  **2,363,325** |  **28,216** |  **149.4** |  **%**  \nResults from operations  |  (120,598  |  )  |  (37,678  |  )  |  (449  |  )  |  (68.8  |  )%   \nProfit/(Loss) for the period  |  (272,862  |  )  |  (296  |  )  |  (3  |  )  |  99.9  |  %   \n**Financial Summary as per non-IFRS measures**  \n**Adjusted Margin(1) **  \nAdjusted Margin - Air Ticketing  |  1,018,276  |  885,855  |  10,576  |  (13.0  |  )%   \nAdjusted Margin - Hotels and Packages  |  278,271  |  400,148  |  4,777  |  43.8  |  %   \nAdjusted Margin - Other Services  |  49,561  |  75,935  |  907  |  53.2  |  %   \nOthers (Including Other Income)  |  169,115  |  145,895  |  1,742  |  (13.7  |  )%   \n**Adjusted EBITDA(2) ** |  **34,888** |  **66,717** |  **797** |  **91.2** |  **%**  \n**Operating Metrics**  \n**Gross Bookings(3) ** |  **17,520,272** |  **17,651,566** |  **210,739** |  **0.7** |  **%**  \nAir Ticketing  |  14,771,705  |  13,260,073  |  158,310  |  (10.2  |  )%   \nHotels and Packages  |  2,183,857  |  3,661,505  |  43,714  |  67.7  |  %   \nOther Services **(6) ** |  564,710  |  729,988  |  8,715  |  29.3  |  %   \n**Adjusted Margin%(4) **  \nAir Ticketing  |  6.9  |  %  |  6.7  |  %   \nHotels and Packages  |  12.7  |  %  |  10.9  |  %   \nOther Services  |  8.8  |  %  |  10.4  |  %   \n**Quantitative details(5) **  \nAir Passengers Booked  |  1,660  |  1,377  |  (17.1  |  )%   \nStand-alone Hotels Room Nights Booked  |  440  |  461  |  4.7  |  %   \nPackages Passengers Travelled  |  5  |  15  |  223.0  |  %   \n  \n**Note:**\n\n(1)  |  As certain parts of our revenue are recognized on a “net” basis and other parts of our revenue are recognized on a “gross” basis, we evaluate our financial performance based on Adjusted Margin, which is a non-IFRS measure.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  See the section below titled “Certain Non-IFRS Measures.”   \n(3)  |  Gross Bookings represent the total amount paid by our customers for travel services, freight services and products booked through us, including taxes, fees and other charges, and are net of cancellation and refunds.   \n(4)  |  Adjusted Margin % is defined as Adjusted Margin as a percentage of Gross Bookings.   \n(5)  |  Quantitative details are considered on a gross basis.   \n(6)  |  Other Services primarily consists of freight business, IT services, bus, rail and cab and others services.   \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, 61,723,260 ordinary shares (on an as-converted basis), par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Ordinary Shares”) were issued and outstanding. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its unaudited results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 beginning at 8:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time (or 7:00 PM India Standard Time) on November 13, 2024.

Announces Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\n\nNov 12, 2024\n\nGURUGRAM, India & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Yatra Online, Inc. (NASDAQ: YTRA) (the “Company”), India’s leading corporate travel services provider and one of India’s leading online travel companies, today announced its unaudited financial and operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported revenue of INR 2,363.3 million (USD 28.2 million), reflecting a substantial year-over-year increase of 149.4%. Adjusted Air Ticketing Margins saw a 13.0% decline, primarily attributable to reduced volumes in the B2C segment as we strategically adjusted discounts to address intensified price competition. In contrast, our Adjusted Hotels and Packages margins improved significantly by 43.8% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in our MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) business. Adjusted EBITDA came in at INR 66.7 million (USD 0.8 million), a 91.2% increase from the prior year. \n\n“Despite headwinds in the B2C air segment, we continue to drive strong growth in our Hotels and Packages and MICE lines of businesses, which helped us more than offset the negative impact of the B2C air business. In the second quarter of FY25, we successfully secured 29 new corporate clients, adding an annual billing potential of INR 1,213.0 million (USD 14.5 million). \n\n“On September 11, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Globe All India Services (Globe Travels) for INR 1,280.0 million (USD 15.3 million) in cash. The results for the quarter include contribution from Globe Travels for 20 days of the quarter from September 11, 2024 - September 30, 2024. This strategic acquisition brought approximately 360 new corporate clients, further strengthening our leadership in India’s corporate travel sector. Globe Travels’ expertise in MICE complements our recent organic expansion in this segment, positioning Yatra as one of India’s largest players in this segment. With minimal overlap in client portfolios, this acquisition diversifies our client base and enhances cross-selling opportunities for hotels and expense management services. Additionally, integrating our digital booking platform with Globe Travel’s largely offline business is expected to drive synergies, operational efficiencies, and cost savings for our corporate clients. \n\n“Progress on corporate restructuring is also advancing as the Company continues to engage with its counsels and other stakeholders including certain regulators towards the formulation of a comprehensive multi-jurisdictional corporate restructuring that can reduce administrative overhead, rationalize costs, and facilitate the growth for the Company. We are encouraged by the strong momentum in our Corporate Travel business, underscored by our growth in new accounts and MICE capabilities. As we continue to navigate a dynamic market, our focus remains on executing our strategic priorities to reinforce our market leadership and drive long-term value for stakeholders.” - Dhruv Shringi, Co-founder and CEO. \n\n**Financial and operating highlights** for the three months ended September 30, 2024 **:**\n\n  * **Revenue** of INR 2,363.3 million (USD 28.2 million), representing an increase of 149.4% year-over-year basis (“YoY”). \n  * **Adjusted Margin(1)  from Air Ticketing ** of INR 885.9 million (USD 10.6 million), representing a decrease of 13.0% YoY. \n  * **Adjusted Margin(1)  from Hotels and Packages ** of INR 400.1 million (USD 4.8 million), representing an increase of 43.8% YoY. \n  * **Total Gross Bookings (Air Ticketing, Hotels and Packages and Other Services)(3) ** of INR 17,651.6 million (USD 210.7 million), representing an increase of 0.7% YoY. \n  * **Loss for the period** was INR 0.3 million (USD 0.1 million) versus a loss of INR 272.9 million (USD 3.3 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a decline in loss by INR 272.6 million (USD 3.3 million) YoY. \n  * **Result from operations** were a loss of INR 37.7 million (USD 0.4 million) versus a loss of INR 120.6 million (USD 1.4 million) for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a decrease in loss by INR 82.9 million (USD 1.0 million) YoY. \n  * **Adjusted EBITDA(2)  ** was INR 66.7 million (USD 0.8 million) reflecting an increase by 91.2% YoY. \n\n**Three months ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2023** |  **2024** |  **2024**  \n**Unaudited** |  **Unaudited** |  **Unaudited** |  **YoY Change**  \n**(In thousands except percentages)** |  **INR** |  **INR** |  **USD** |  **%**  \n**Financial Summary as per IFRS**  \n**Revenue** |  **947,574** |  **2,363,325** |  **28,216** |  **149.4** |  **%**  \nResults from operations  |  (120,598  |  )  |  (37,678  |  )  |  (449  |  )  |  (68.8  |  )%   \nProfit/(Loss) for the period  |  (272,862  |  )  |  (296  |  )  |  (3  |  )  |  99.9  |  %   \n**Financial Summary as per non-IFRS measures**  \n**Adjusted Margin(1) **  \nAdjusted Margin - Air Ticketing  |  1,018,276  |  885,855  |  10,576  |  (13.0  |  )%   \nAdjusted Margin - Hotels and Packages  |  278,271  |  400,148  |  4,777  |  43.8  |  %   \nAdjusted Margin - Other Services  |  49,561  |  75,935  |  907  |  53.2  |  %   \nOthers (Including Other Income)  |  169,115  |  145,895  |  1,742  |  (13.7  |  )%   \n**Adjusted EBITDA(2) ** |  **34,888** |  **66,717** |  **797** |  **91.2** |  **%**  \n**Operating Metrics**  \n**Gross Bookings(3) ** |  **17,520,272** |  **17,651,566** |  **210,739** |  **0.7** |  **%**  \nAir Ticketing  |  14,771,705  |  13,260,073  |  158,310  |  (10.2  |  )%   \nHotels and Packages  |  2,183,857  |  3,661,505  |  43,714  |  67.7  |  %   \nOther Services **(6) ** |  564,710  |  729,988  |  8,715  |  29.3  |  %   \n**Adjusted Margin%(4) **  \nAir Ticketing  |  6.9  |  %  |  6.7  |  %   \nHotels and Packages  |  12.7  |  %  |  10.9  |  %   \nOther Services  |  8.8  |  %  |  10.4  |  %   \n**Quantitative details(5) **  \nAir Passengers Booked  |  1,660  |  1,377  |  (17.1  |  )%   \nStand-alone Hotels Room Nights Booked  |  440  |  461  |  4.7  |  %   \nPackages Passengers Travelled  |  5  |  15  |  223.0  |  %   \n  \n**Note:**\n\n(1)  |  As certain parts of our revenue are recognized on a “net” basis and other parts of our revenue are recognized on a “gross” basis, we evaluate our financial performance based on Adjusted Margin, which is a non-IFRS measure.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  See the section below titled “Certain Non-IFRS Measures.”   \n(3)  |  Gross Bookings represent the total amount paid by our customers for travel services, freight services and products booked through us, including taxes, fees and other charges, and are net of cancellation and refunds.   \n(4)  |  Adjusted Margin % is defined as Adjusted Margin as a percentage of Gross Bookings.   \n(5)  |  Quantitative details are considered on a gross basis.   \n(6)  |  Other Services primarily consists of freight business, IT services, bus, rail and cab and others services.   \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, 61,723,260 ordinary shares (on an as-converted basis), par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Ordinary Shares”) were issued and outstanding. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its unaudited results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 beginning at 8:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time (or 7:00 PM India Standard Time) on November 13, 2024.
