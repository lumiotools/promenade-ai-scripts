Portfolio Receipts is defined as the\nsum of Royalty Receipts and Milestones and other contractual receipts. Royalty Receipts includes variable payments based\non sales of products, net of contractual payments to the legacy non-controlling interests, that are attributed to Royalty\nPharma.\nMilestones and other contractual receipts include sales-based or regulatory milestone payments and other fixed\ncontractual receipts, net of contractual payments to legacy non-controlling interests, that are attributed to Royalty Pharma.\nPortfolio Receipts does not include proceeds from equity securities or proceeds from purchases and sales of marketable\nsecurities, neither of which are central to our fundamental business strategy.\nPortfolio Receipts is calculated as the sum of the following line items from our GAAP statements of cash flows: Cash\ncollections from financial royalty assets, Cash collections from intangible royalty assets, Other royalty cash collections,\nProceeds from available for sale debt securities and Distributions from equity method investees less Distributions to legacy\nnon-controlling interests - Portfolio Receipts, which represent contractual distributions of Royalty Receipts, milestones and\nother contractual receipts to RPSFT and the Legacy Investors Partnerships.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are non-GAAP liquidity measures that exclude the impact of certain items and\ntherefore have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio\nCash Flow are important non-GAAP measures used to analyze liquidity because they are key components of certain\nmaterial covenants contained within Royalty Pharma’s credit agreement. Royalty Pharma cautions readers that amounts\npresented in accordance with the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow may not be the same as similar\nmeasures used by other companies or analysts. These non-GAAP liquidity measures have limitations as analytical tools, and\nyou should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of Royalty Pharma’s results as reported under\nGAAP.\n7\nThe definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow used by Royalty Pharma are the same as the definitions in the\ncredit agreement. Noncompliance with the interest coverage ratio, leverage ratio and Portfolio Cash Flow ratio covenants\nunder the credit agreement could result in lenders requiring the company to immediately repay all amounts borrowed. If\nRoyalty Pharma cannot satisfy these covenants, it would be prohibited under the credit agreement from engaging in certain\nactivities, such as incurring additional indebtedness, paying dividends, making certain payments, and acquiring and\ndisposing of assets. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are critical to the assessment of Royalty\nPharma’s liquidity.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are used by management as key liquidity measures in the evaluation of the\ncompany’s ability to generate cash from operations. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow when\nconsidering available cash, including for decision-making purposes related to funding of acquisitions, debt repayments,\ndividends and other discretionary investments. Further, these non-GAAP liquidity measures help management, the audit\ncommittee and investors evaluate the company’s ability to generate liquidity from operating activities.\nThe company has provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP liquidity measures to the most directly comparable GAAP\nfinancial measure, being net cash provided by operating activities in Table 4.\nRoyalty Pharma Investor Relations and Communications\n+1 (212) 883-6772\nir@royaltypharma.com\n8\nRoyalty Pharma plc\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (unaudited)\nTable 1\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023\nIncome and other revenues\nIncome from financial royalty assets 533 509\nOther royalty income and revenues 32 28\nTotal income and other revenues 565 536\nOperating (income)/expense\nProvision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets (228) 277\nResearch and development funding expense 1 51\nGeneral and administrative expenses 57 57\nTotal operating (income)/expense, net (170) 385\nOperating income 735 151\nOther (income)/expense\nEquity in (earnings)/losses of equity method investees (10) 5\nInterest expense 67 46\nOther income, net (127) (22)\nTotal other (income)/expense, net (71) 29\nConsolidated net income before tax 806 122\nIncome tax expense — —\nConsolidated net income 806 122\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests 262 50\nNet income attributable to Royalty Pharma plc 544 72\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\n9\nRoyalty Pharma plc\nSelected Balance Sheet Data (unaudited)\nTable 2\n($ in millions) As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents 950 477\nTotal current and non-current financial royalty assets, net 15,734 14,827\nTotal assets 18,042 16,382\nCurrent portion of long-term debt 997 —\nLong-term debt, net of current portion 6,610 6,135\nTotal liabilities 7,784 6,298\nTotal shareholders’ equity 10,258 10,084\n10\nRoyalty Pharma plc\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (unaudited)\nTable 3\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCash flows from operating activities:\nCash collections from financial royalty assets 792 708 2,206 2,454\nCash collections from intangible royalty assets 0 0 14 1\nOther royalty cash collections 30 25 79 84\nDistributions from equity method investees — 0 13 19\nInterest received 17 29 37 63\nDevelopment-stage funding payments -

Exhibits 82\nSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements”\nwithin the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as\n“may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “target,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “goal,” “predicts,” “project,”\n“potential” or “continue,” the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather\nare based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current and prospective assets, our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. These\nstatements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult\nto predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. There are important factors\nthat could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or\nachievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q in the context of the numerous risks outlined in Part II under Item 1A. under “Risk Factors.”\nThese risks and uncertainties include factors related to, among other topics:\n• sales risks of biopharmaceutical products on which we receive royalties;\n• the ability of RP Management, LLC (the “Manager”) to locate suitable assets for us to acquire;\n• uncertainties related to the acquisition of interests in development-stage biopharmaceutical product candidates and our strategy to add development-\nstage product candidates to our product portfolio;\n• the assumptions underlying our business model;\n• our ability to successfully execute our royalty acquisition strategy;\n• our ability to leverage our competitive strengths;\n• actual and potential conflicts of interest with the Manager and its affiliates;\n• the ability of the Manager or its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals;\n• the effect of changes to tax legislation and our tax position; and\n• the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nAlthough we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of those expectations could prove to be inaccurate,\nand as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those expectations also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a\nprojection or forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and business\nobjectives will be achieved. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any of these forward-\nlooking statements. We are under no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to conform\nour prior statements to actual results or revised expectations.\nPART 1.

Prior to the Exchange Offer (defined below), Old RPI was owned by various partnerships (the “Legacy Investors\nPartnerships”).\nRP Management, LLC (the “Manager”), a Delaware limited liability company, is responsible for our management, including our day-to-day operations,\npursuant to advisory and management agreements (collectively, the “Management Agreement”).\nWe are the largest buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties and a leading funder of innovation across the biopharmaceutical industry. We fund innovation in\nthe biopharmaceutical industry both directly and indirectly—directly when we partner with companies to co-fund late-stage clinical trials and new product\nlaunches in exchange for future royalties, and indirectly when we acquire existing royalties from the original innovators.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Preparation and Use of Estimates\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America (“GAAP”).\nIn the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary to present fairly the results of the interim periods have been included and consist of\nnormal and recurring adjustments. Certain information and footnote disclosures have been condensed or omitted as permitted under GAAP. As such, the\ninformation included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related\nnotes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements\nas well as the reported amounts of income, revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The results for\nthe interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.\n6\nROYALTY PHARMA PLC\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Royalty Pharma and all majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries,\nas well as variable interest entities, where we are the primary beneficiary. We consolidate based upon evaluation of our power, through voting rights or similar\nrights, to direct the activities of another entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. For consolidated entities where we own or are\nexposed to less than 100% of the economics, we record Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in our condensed consolidated statements of\noperations equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interest retained in such entities by the respective non-controlling parties.\nWe consummated an exchange offer on February 11, 2020 (the “Exchange Offer”) to facilitate the IPO. Through the Exchange Offer, investors which\nrepresented 82% of the aggregate limited partnership in the Legacy Investors Partnerships exchanged their limited partnership interests in the Legacy Investors\nPartnerships for limited partnership interests in the Continuing Investors Partnerships. Following the Exchange Offer, we became the indirect owner of an 82%\neconomic interest in Old RPI through our subsidiary RPI 2019 Intermediate Finance Trust, a Delaware statutory trust. We are entitled to 82% of the economics\nof Old RPI’s wholly-owned subsidiary RPI Finance Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (“RPIFT”), and 66% of Royalty Pharma Collection Trust, a Delaware\nstatutory trust (“RPCT”). Prior to December 29, 2023, the remaining 34% of RPCT was owned by the Legacy Investors Partnerships and Royalty Pharma\nSelect Finance Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (“RPSFT”), which was wholly owned by Royalty Pharma Select, an Irish unit trust.\nIn 2022, we became an indirect owner of an 82% economic interest in Royalty Pharma Investments ICAV (“RPI ICAV”), which was previously owned\ndirectly by Old RPI.\nIn December 2023, RPI 2019 ICAV acquired the remaining interest in RPCT owned by RPSFT and, as such, RPSFT no longer holds a non-controlling\ninterest in RPCT. Prior to December 2023, we reported non-controlling interest related to a de minimis interest in RPCT held by RPSFT (together with the\nLegacy Investors Partnership’s interest in Old RPI and RPI ICAV, the “legacy non-controlling interests”), which also existed prior to our IPO.\nWe report three non-controlling interests: (1) the Legacy Investors Partnerships’ ownership of approximately 18% in Old RPI and RPI ICAV, which\nexisted prior to our IPO, and, following the consummation of our IPO, (2) the Continuing Investors Partnerships’ indirect ownership in RP Holdings through\ntheir indirect ownership of RP Holdings Class B Interests (the “continuing non-controlling interests”) and (3) RPI EPA Holdings, LP’s (“EPA Holdings”)\nownership of the RP Holdings’ Class C ordinary share (the “RP Holdings Class C Special Interest”). Income will not be allocated to EPA Holdings until certain\nperformance conditions are met.\nAll intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassification\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, available for sale debt\nsecurities, financial royalty assets, derivatives and receivables. Our cash management and investment policy limits investment instruments to investment-grade\nsecurities with the objective to preserve capital and to maintain liquidity until the funds are needed for operations. Our cash and cash equivalents balances as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were held with Bank of America, State Street, TD Bank, Citibank, U.S. Bank, DNB Bank and Scotiabank. Our\nprimary operating accounts significantly exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits.\n7\nROYALTY PHARMA PLC\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nThe majority of our financial royalty assets and receivables arise from contractual royalty agreements that entitle us to royalties on the sales of underlying\nbiopharmaceutical products in the United States, Europe and the rest of the world, with concentrations of credit risk limited due to the broad range of marketers\nresponsible for paying royalties to us and the variety of geographies from which our royalties on product sales are derived. The products in which we hold\nroyalties are marketed by leading industry participants, including, among others, Vertex, GSK, Roche, Johnson & Johnson, Biogen, AbbVie, Astellas, Pfizer,\nNovartis and Gilead. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Vertex, as the marketer and payor of our royalties on the cystic fibrosis franchise,\naccounted for 33% and 32% of our current portion of financial royalty assets, respectively, and represented the largest individual marketer and payor of our\nroyalties.\nWe monitor the financial performance and creditworthiness of the counterparties to our royalty agreements so that we can properly assess and respond to\nchanges in their credit profile. To date, we have not experienced any significant credit losses with respect to the collection of income or revenues on our royalty\nassets.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies from our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n3. Available for Sale Debt Securities\nFunding Arrangements with Cytokinetics\nIn May 2024, we expanded our funding collaboration with Cytokinetics, Incorporated (“Cytokinetics”) to provide up to $575 million. As part of the\nexpanded funding collaboration, we provided funding of $100 million (“Cytokinetics Development Funding”) for Cytokinetics’ Phase 3 clinical trial of\nomecamtiv mecarbil and amended the funding agreement that we entered into with Cytokinetics in 2022 to provide two additional funding tranches (as\namended, “Cytokinetics Commercial Launch Funding”). Following the amendment in May 2024, the Cytokinetics Commercial Launch Funding is comprised\nof seven tranches with a total funding of up to $525 million.\nOur return on the Cytokinetics Development Funding depends on the outcome of omecamtiv mecarbil’s Phase 3 clinical trial and approval by the U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). If omecamtiv mecarbil’s Phase 3 clinical trial is successful and approval by the FDA is received within a specific\ntimeframe, we will receive a return of $100 million and the greater of an incremental 2.0% royalty on annual net sales of omecamtiv mecarbil or quarterly fixed\npayments for 18 quarters and an incremental 2.0% royalty thereafter. If FDA approval is not received within a specific timeframe, we will receive a return of\n2.4 times the Cytokinetics Development Funding over 18 quarters. If the Phase 3 clinical trial is not successful within a specific timeframe, we will receive a\nreturn of 2.3 times the Cytokinetics Development Funding over 22 quarters.\nOut of the seven tranches of the Cytokinetics Commercial Launch Funding, tranches one and six have been funded. Tranches two and three are no longer\navailable because the related regulatory milestones were not met. Tranches four, five and seven are available for draw upon the occurrence of certain regulatory\nand clinical development milestones (“Cytokinetics Funding Commitments”). In April 2024, the contingency for the fourth tranche was met, triggering the\nrequirement that Cytokinetics draws at least $50 million, with the ability to draw an additional $25 million within one year. For tranches one, four, five, six and\nseven, we expect to receive a return of 1.9 times the amount drawn over 34 consecutive quarterly payments beginning on the last business day of the seventh\nquarter following the quarter of the funding date of each tranche. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we began receiving quarterly repayments on the first tranche.\nWe elected the fair value option to account for the Cytokinetics Development Funding and the Cytokinetics Commercial Launch Funding (collectively the\n“Cytokinetics Funding Arrangements”) as it most accurately reflects the nature of the funding arrangements. The funded Cytokinetics Funding Arrangements\nare recorded within Available for sale debt securities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Cytokinetics Funding Commitments, which include\noptions and forwards, are recognized at fair value within Other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The changes in the fair value of the\nfunded Cytokinetics Funding Arrangements and Cytokinetics Funding Commitments are recorded within Gains on available for sale debt securities in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations.\n8\nROYALTY PHARMA PLC\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nFurther, as part of the expanded funding collaboration in May 2024, we provided funding for the clinical trials of CK-586 in exchange for a royalty and\npurchased Cytokinetics common stock, both of which are further described in Note 4–Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments. Lastly, the funding\ncollaboration also included a royalty restructuring on aficamten.\nThe table below summarizes the components of our funding collaboration with Cytokinetics and related funding status as of September 30, 2024 (in\nthousands):\nRequired Future Potential Future\nFunded Draw Draw Total\nCytokinetics Commercial Launch Funding(1) $ 100,000 $ 50,000 $ 300,000 $ 450,000\nCytokinetics Development Funding 100,000 — — 100,000\nCytokinetics R&D Funding Derivative(2) 50,000 — 150,000 200,000\nCytokinetics Common Stock 50,000 — — 50,000\nTotal $ 300,000 $ 50,000 $ 450,000 $ 800,000\n(1) Total excludes $75 million for two tranches that are no longer available.

We have the option to fund up to an additional $150 million. See Note 4–Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments for\nadditional discussion.\nMorphoSys Development Funding Bonds\nIn September 2022, we provided MorphoSys AG (“MorphoSys”) funding of $300 million (“MorphoSys Development Funding Bonds”). We expect to\nreceive a return of 2.2 times the MorphoSys Development Funding Bonds, payable on a quarterly basis over nine years, with the first payment beginning in the\nfourth quarter of 2024.\nWe elected the fair value option to account for the MorphoSys Development Funding Bonds as it most accurately reflects the nature of the instrument.\nThe MorphoSys Development Funding Bonds are recorded within Available for sale debt securities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The changes\nin the fair value of the MorphoSys Development Funding Bonds are recorded within Gains on available for sale debt securities in the condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nThe table below summarizes our available for sale debt securities recorded at fair value (in thousands):\nUnrealized Current Non-Current Non-Current\nCost Gains Fair Value Assets Assets Liabilities Total\nAs of September 30, 2024\nDebt securities(1) $ 512,554 $ 193,246 $ 705,800 $ 48,500 $ 657,300 $ — $ 705,800\nFunding commitments(2) (12,300) 7,700 (4,600) — — (4,600) (4,600)\nTotal $ 500,254 $ 200,946 $ 701,200 $ 48,500 $ 657,300 $ (4,600) $ 701,200\nAs of December 31, 2023\nDebt securities(1) $ 359,667 $ 95,733 $ 455,400 $ 18,300 $ 437,100 $ — $ 455,400\nFunding commitments(2) (7,300) 6,400 (900) — — (900) (900)\nTotal $ 352,367 $ 102,133 $ 454,500 $ 18,300 $ 437,100 $ (900) $ 454,500\n(1) The cost related to tranches one and six of the Cytokinetics Commercial Launch Funding and the cost for the Cytokinetics Development Funding reflect the fair values on their respective\nfunding dates.

In March 2023, the FDA approved Zavzpret, the\nintranasal formulation of zavegepant, and we received a $475 million milestone payment which resulted in partial settlement of the derivative instruments.\nValuation Inputs for Recurring Fair Value Measurements\nBelow is a discussion of the valuation inputs used for financial instruments classified as Level 3 measurement as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 in the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any financial instruments recorded at fair\nvalue using Level 2 inputs.\nCytokinetics Common Stock\nIn May 2024, we purchased approximately 980 thousand shares of Cytokinetics common stock. As part of the transaction, we are restricted from selling\nthe Cytokinetics common stock for six months following the close of the transaction. The fair value of the Cytokinetics common stock as of September 30,\n2024 was based on the closing stock price and adjusted for the transfer restriction, which was determined by calculating the value of a put option over the\nCytokinetics common stock to match the duration of the transfer restriction. This methodology incorporates Level 3 inputs, including the estimated volatility of\nthe Cytokinetics common stock, which requires the use of significant judgement. Our estimated volatility could be reasonably different than the actual\nvolatility for the Cytokinetics common stock which would mean that the estimated fair value for the Cytokinetics common stock could be significantly higher\nor lower than the fair value determined by management at any particular date.\nCytokinetics Research & Development (“R&D”) Funding Derivative\nIn May 2024, we funded $50 million upfront in exchange for a royalty on CK-586. We have an option to fund up to an additional $150 million for which\nwe would be eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $150 million upon regulatory approvals and an incremental royalty on CK-586. Upon a change of\ncontrol event, we have the option to cause Cytokinetics to pay us 1.5 times the initial and additional funding amounts in a lump sum to terminate our rights to\nreceive royalties and milestone payments. Our funding arrangement on CK-586 is accounted for as a derivative instrument and is recorded at fair value\n(“Cytokinetics R&D Funding Derivative”).\nWe estimated the fair value of the Cytokinetics R&D Funding Derivative as of September 30, 2024 by utilizing probability-adjusted discounted cash flow\ncalculations using Level 3 inputs, including the probabilities of us exercising the additional funding option, regulatory approvals and the occurrence of a\nchange of control event during the duration of the arrangement. We also assumed a risk-adjusted discount rate of 11.2% as of September 30, 2024. Our estimate\nof expectation of timing and probabilities of us exercising the additional funding option, regulatory approvals and a change of control event, the risk-adjusted\ndiscount rate and the interest rate volatility could reasonably be different than the assumptions selected by a market participant, which would mean that the\nestimated fair value could be significantly higher or lower.\n12\nROYALTY PHARMA PLC\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nCytokinetics Funding Arrangements and Cytokinetics Funding Commitments\nWe estimated the fair values of the funded Cytokinetics Funding Arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 by utilizing probability-\nadjusted discounted cash flow calculations using Level 3 inputs, including an estimated risk-adjusted discount rate and the probability that there will be a\nchange of control event, which would result in accelerated payments. Developing a risk-adjusted discount rate and assessing the probability that there will be a\nchange of control event over the duration of the Cytokinetics Funding Arrangements require significant judgement. Our estimate of the risk-adjusted discount\nrate could reasonably be different than the discount rate selected by a market participant, which would mean that the estimated fair value could be significantly\nhigher or lower. Our expectation of the probability and timing of the occurrence of a change of control event could reasonably be different than the timing of an\nactual change of control event, and if so, would mean that the estimated fair value could be significantly higher or lower than the fair value determined by\nmanagement at any particular date.\nWe estimated the fair value of the Cytokinetics Funding Commitments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 using a Monte Carlo simulation\nmethodology that includes simulating the interest rate movements using a Geometric Brownian Motion-based pricing model. This methodology simulates the\nlikelihood of future discount rates exceeding the counterparty’s assumed cost of debt, which would impact Cytokinetics’ decision to exercise its option to draw\non each respective tranche. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, this methodology incorporates Level 3 inputs, including the probability of a\nchange of control event occurring during the investment term, an assumed interest rate volatility of 40.0% and 37.5%, respectively, and an assumed risk-\nadjusted discount rate of 11.2% and 10.9%, respectively. We also assumed probabilities for the occurrence of each regulatory or clinical milestone, which\nimpacts the availability of each future tranche of funding. Our estimate of expectation of the probability and timing of the occurrence of a change of control\nevent, the risk-adjusted discount rate, the interest rate volatility and the probabilities of each underlying milestone could reasonably be different than the\nassumptions selected by a market participant, which would mean that the estimated fair value could be significantly higher or lower.\nMorphoSys Development Funding Bonds\nWe estimated the fair value of the MorphoSys Development Funding Bonds as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 based on a discounted cash\nflow calculation using estimated risk-adjusted discount rates, which are Level 3 inputs. Our estimate of the risk adjusted discount rates could reasonably be\ndifferent than the discount rates selected by a market participant, which would mean that the estimated fair value could be significantly higher or lower.\nFinancial Assets Not Measured at Fair Value\nFinancial royalty assets are measured and carried on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at amortized cost using the effective interest method.\nFinancial royalty assets do not include our entire portfolio of investments, and specifically exclude the following:\n1. development-stage product candidates where the funding was (i) expensed as upfront R&D upon acquisition (e.g., Trodelvy and Nurtec ODT), (ii)\nexpensed as ongoing R&D (e.g., historically, Soliqua from our co-funding agreement with Sanofi) or (iii) treated as a derivative instrument (e.g., CK-\n586); and\n2. contractual funding arrangements (e.g., the MorphoSys Development Funding Bonds and the Cytokinetics Funding Arrangements), which are accounted\nfor as available for sale debt securities.\nThe fair value of financial royalty assets is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy since it is determined based on inputs that are both\nsignificant and unobservable. Management calculates the fair value of financial royalty assets using forecasted royalty receipts based on the projected product\nsales for all royalty bearing products which are estimated using sell-side equity research analysts’ consensus sales forecasts.

Non-Consolidated Affiliates\nWe have equity investments in certain entities at a level that provide us with significant influence. We account for such investments as equity method\ninvestments or as equity securities over which we have elected the fair value option.\nApiJect\nIn April 2022, we acquired common stock and a revenue participation right from ApiJect. We elected the fair value option to account for our investments\nin ApiJect because it is more reflective of current values for such investments. We are also required to purchase additional common stock from ApiJect if\ncertain milestones are achieved. The fair value of our equity investment in ApiJect is recorded within Equity securities and the change in fair value is recorded\nwithin Gains on equity securities. The fair value of the revenue participation right is recorded within Other assets and the change in fair value is recorded\nwithin Other non-operating expenses/(income), net. No amounts were due from or to ApiJect related to the revenue participation right as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe Legacy SLP Interest\nIn connection with the Exchange Offer, we acquired a special limited partnership interest in the Legacy Investors Partnerships (the “Legacy SLP\nInterest”) from the Continuing Investors Partnerships for $303.7 million in exchange for issuing shares in our subsidiary. As a result, we became a special\nlimited partner in the Legacy Investors Partnerships. The Legacy SLP Interest entitles us to the equivalent of performance distribution payments that would\nhave been paid to the general partner of the Legacy Investors Partnerships and an income allocation on a similar basis. Our income allocation is equal to the\ngeneral partner’s former contractual rights to the income of the Legacy Investors Partnerships, net of amortization of the basis difference. The Legacy SLP\nInterest is accounted for under the equity method as our Manager is also the Manager of the Legacy Investors Partnerships and has the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence. The Legacy Investors Partnerships no longer participate in investment opportunities from June 30, 2020 and, as such, the value of the\nLegacy SLP Interest is expected to decline over time. The Legacy Investors Partnerships also indirectly own a non-controlling interest in Old RPI and RPI\nICAV.\nThe income allocation from the Legacy SLP Interest is based on an estimate as the Legacy Investors Partnerships are private partnerships that report on a\nlag. Management’s estimate of equity in earnings from the Legacy SLP Interest for the current period will be updated for historical results in the subsequent\nperiod. Equity in earnings from the Legacy SLP Interest is recorded within Equity in (earnings)/losses of equity method investees. We recorded income\nallocations of $10.2 million and $5.5 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. We recorded a loss allocation of $2.3 million and\nan income allocation of $0.6 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. We collected cash receipts from the Legacy SLP Interest of\n$11.0 million and $19.9 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. We collected cash receipts from the Legacy SLP Interest of\n$4.8 million and $9.7 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively.\nThe Avillion Entities\nWe account for our partnership interests in Avillion Financing I, LP and its related entities (“Avillion I”) and BAv Financing II, LP and its related entities\n(“Avillion II” and, together with Avillion I, the “Avillion Entities”) as equity method investments because RPIFT has the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over the Avillion Entities. Equity in earnings from the Avillion Entities is recorded within Equity in (earnings)/losses of equity method investees. We\nrecorded an income allocation of $0.2 million and a loss allocation of $7.6 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively. We recorded\na loss allocation of $3.0 million and an income allocation of $28.0 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively.\nOn December 19, 2017, the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application for Pfizer’s Bosulif. Avillion I is eligible to receive fixed payments\nfrom Pfizer based on this approval under its co-development agreement with Pfizer. The only operations of Avillion I are the collection of cash and unwinding\nof the discount on the series of fixed annual payments due from Pfizer. We received distributions from Avillion I of $13.4 million and $13.6 million in the first\nnine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n16\nROYALTY PHARMA PLC\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nIn May 2018, RPIFT entered into an agreement with Avillion II, which was subsequently amended, to fund a total of $155 million over multiple years for\na portion of the costs of Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials to advance Airsupra, formerly known as PT027, which was approved by the FDA in January 2023. Avillion\nII is a party to a co-development agreement with AstraZeneca to develop Airsupra for the treatment of asthma in exchange for royalties, a series of success-\nbased milestones and other potential payments. In the first quarter of 2023, AstraZeneca notified Avillion II that it elected to pay a fee of $80 million to Avillion\nII to exercise an option to commercialize Airsupra in the United States and we received our pro rata portion of the exercise fee of $34.8 million from Avillion\nII. In the third quarter of 2024, we received a distribution of $0.5 million from Avillion II, which was the first distribution related to the Airsupra royalty.\nOur maximum exposure to loss at any particular reporting date is limited to the carrying value of our equity method investments plus the unfunded\ncommitments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had unfunded commitments related to the Avillion Entities of $10.3 million and\n$16.3 million, respectively.\n8. Research and Development Funding Expense\nR&D funding expense consists of payments that we have made to counterparties to acquire royalties or milestones on product candidates. R&D funding\nexpense includes development-stage funding payments made to counterparties on an upfront basis or upon pre-approval milestones, and development-stage\nfunding payments that are made to counterparties over time as the related product candidates undergo clinical trials with our counterparties. During the first\nnine months of 2024 and 2023, we did not enter into any new ongoing R&D funding arrangements.\nWe recognized R&D funding expense of $0.5 million and $1.5 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, related to ongoing\ndevelopment-stage funding payments. We recognized R&D funding expense of $50.5 million and $51.5 million in the third quarter and first nine months of\n2023, respectively, primarily related to a $50.0 million clinical milestone payment to Cytokinetics for aficamten.\n9.

The 2024 Notes were issued at a total discount of $28.8 million and we\ncapitalized approximately $12.6 million in debt issuance costs primarily composed of underwriting fees. The 2024 Notes were issued with a weighted average\ncoupon rate and a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.48% and 5.92%, respectively.\nWe issued $1.3 billion and $6.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in 2021 (the “2021 Notes”) and 2020 (the “2020 Notes”), respectively. The 2021 Notes\nand 2020 Notes were issued at a total discount of $176.4 million and we capitalized approximately $52.7 million in debt issuance costs primarily composed of\nunderwriting fees. The 2021 Notes were issued with a weighted average coupon rate and a weighted average effective interest rate of 2.80% and 3.06%,\nrespectively. The 2020 Notes were issued with a weighted average coupon rate and a weighted average effective interest rate of 2.13% and 2.50%, respectively.\nIn September 2023, we repaid $1.0 billion of the 2020 Notes upon maturity.\nInterest on each series of the 2024 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2020 Notes (the “Notes”) accrues at the respective rate per annum and is payable semi-annually\nin arrears on March 2 and September 2 of each year. The first interest payment date for the 2024 Notes will be March 2, 2025.\nThe Notes may be redeemed at our option at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed and\n(ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to\nthe date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis at the treasury rate, plus a make-whole premium as defined in the indenture. In\neach case, accrued and unpaid interest is also required to be redeemed to the date of redemption.\nUpon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event and downgrade in the rating of our Notes by two of three credit agencies, the holders may\nrequire us to repurchase all or part of their Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and\nunpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.\nOur obligations under the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by RP Holdings, a non-wholly-owned subsidiary. We are required to comply\nwith certain covenants under our Notes and as of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our outstanding Notes using Level 2 inputs was approximately $6.8 billion and\n$5.1 billion, respectively.\nSenior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nOur subsidiary, RP Holdings, as borrower, initially entered into to the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) on\nSeptember 15, 2021, which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement,\nwhich was entered into on December 22, 2023, increased the borrowing capacity to $1.8 billion for general corporate purposes with $1.69 billion of the\nrevolving commitments maturing on December 22, 2028 and the remaining $110.0 million of revolving commitments maturing on October 31, 2027. On\nJanuary 24, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Credit Agreement to make certain technical modifications. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is subject to an interest rate, at our option, of either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the\nadministrative agent’s prime rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and (3) Term SOFR plus 1% or (b) Daily SOFR, Term SOFR, the Alternative Currency\nTerm Rate or the Alternative Currency Daily Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus in each case, the applicable margin. The applicable margin\nfor the Revolving Credit Facility varies based on our public debt rating. Accordingly, the interest rates for the Revolving Credit Facility fluctuate during the\nterm of the facility based on changes in the applicable interest rate and future changes in our public debt rating.\n18\nROYALTY PHARMA PLC\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nThe Credit Agreement that governs the Revolving Credit Facility contains certain customary covenants, that among other things, require us to maintain (i)\na consolidated leverage ratio at or below 4.00 to 1.00 (or at or below 4.50 to 1.00 following a qualifying material acquisition) of consolidated funded debt to\nAdjusted EBITDA, each as defined and calculated as set forth in the Credit Agreement, (ii) a consolidated coverage ratio at or above 2.50 to 1.00 of Adjusted\nEBITDA to consolidated interest expense, each as defined and calculated as set forth in the Credit Agreement and (iii) a consolidated Portfolio Cash Flow\nRatio at or below 5.00 to 1.00 (or at or below 5.50 to 1.00 following a qualifying material acquisition) of consolidated funded debt to Portfolio Cash Flow, each\nas defined and calculated as set forth in the Credit Agreement. All obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by us.\nNoncompliance with the leverage ratio, portfolio cash flow ratio and interest coverage ratio covenants under the Credit Agreement could result in our lenders\nrequiring us to immediately repay all amounts borrowed. The Credit Agreement includes customary covenants for credit facilities of this type that limit our\nability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional indebtedness, paying dividends, making certain payments and acquiring and disposing of\nassets. As of September 30, 2024, RP Holdings was in compliance with these covenants.\nPrincipal Payments on the Notes\nThe future principal payments for our borrowings as of September 30, 2024 over the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Principal Payments\nRemainder of 2024 $ —\n2025 1,000,000\n2026 —\n2027 1,000,000\n2028 —\nThereafter 5,800,000\nTotal(1) $ 7,800,000\n(1) Excludes unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $192.6 million as of September 30, 2024, which are amortized through interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt\nobligations.\n10. Shareholders’ Equity\nCapital Structure\nWe have two classes of voting shares: Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, each of which has one vote per ordinary share. The Class A\nordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, except as otherwise required by\napplicable law. Our Class B ordinary shares are not publicly traded and holders of Class B ordinary shares only have limited rights to receive a distribution\nequal to their nominal value upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up. As of September 30, 2024, we have 446,038 thousand Class A ordinary shares and\n144,881 thousand Class B ordinary shares outstanding.\nAn exchange agreement entered into by us, RP Holdings, the Continuing Investors Partnerships, RPI International Partners 2019, LP, RPI US Feeder\n2019, LP, RPI International Feeder 2019, LP and EPA Holdings (as amended from time to time, the “Exchange Agreement”) governs the exchange of RP\nHoldings Class B Interests indirectly held by the Continuing Investors Partnerships for our Class A ordinary shares. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, RP\nHoldings Class B interests are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for our Class A ordinary shares on a quarterly basis. Each such exchange also results in the\nre-designation of the same number of our Class B ordinary shares as deferred shares. Such deferred shares are non-voting and do not confer a right to\nparticipate in the profits of the Company or any right to receive dividends. As of September 30, 2024, we have 390,502 thousand deferred shares outstanding.\nIn addition, we have in issue 50 thousand Class R redeemable shares, which do not entitle the holder to voting or dividend rights. As required by the U.K.\nCompanies Act 2006, the Class R redeemable shares were issued to ensure Royalty Pharma Limited had sufficient sterling denominated share capital upon its\nre-registration in 2020 as Royalty Pharma plc, a public company. The Class R redeemable shares may be redeemed at our option in the future. Any such\nredemption would be at the nominal value of £1 each.\n19\nROYALTY PHARMA PLC\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nClass A Ordinary Share Repurchases\nIn March 2023, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our Class A ordinary\nshares. The authorization for the share repurchase program expires on June 23, 2027 and repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately\nnegotiated transactions. In the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased 6.6 million shares at a cost of approximately $179.7 million. In the first nine months\nof 2023, we repurchased 8.9 million shares at a cost of approximately $278.6 million.

As the Continuing Investors Partnerships exchange RP Holdings Class B Interests indirectly held by them for Class A ordinary shares, the\nContinuing Investors Partnerships’ indirect ownership in RP Holdings decreases. We operate and control the business affairs of RP Holdings through our\nownership of RP Holdings Class A Interests and RP Holdings Class B Interests. In connection with our repurchase of Class A ordinary shares that began in the\nsecond quarter of 2023, RP Holdings also began to retire RP Holdings Class A Interests held by us which reduces our ownership in RP Holdings. The change in\nRP Holdings ownership between the Continuing Investors Partnerships and us as a result of (1) the exchanges of RP Holding Class B Interests for Class A\nordinary shares and (2) retirement of RP Holdings Class A Interests is reflected through Other exchanges in the above tables and in our condensed consolidated\nstatements of shareholders’ equity.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Continuing Investors Partnerships indirectly owned approximately 24% of RP Holdings with the remaining 76% owned by\nRoyalty Pharma plc. As of September 30, 2023, the Continuing Investors Partnerships indirectly owned approximately 25% of RP Holdings with the remaining\n75% owned by Royalty Pharma plc.\nRPSFT\nWe historically reported a non-controlling interest related to a de minimis interest in RPCT held by RPSFT. In December 2023, we acquired the\nremaining interest in RPCT held by RPSFT by effectively purchasing the net assets of RPSFT and its parent entities, which primarily consisted of cash and\nRPSFT’s right to receive a portion of royalties received by RPCT. The purchase price of approximately $11.4 million was recorded within Other current\nliabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. The finalized purchase price of approximately $12.5 million, which was\nsubject to post-closing adjustments primarily related to the final determination of net asset values and liquidation costs, was fully paid as of June 30, 2024.\nFollowing this transaction in December 2023, RPSFT no longer holds a non-controlling interest in RPCT.\nRP Holdings Class C Special Interest Held by EPA Holdings\nEPA Holdings, an affiliate of the Manager, is entitled to Equity Performance Awards (as defined below) through its RP Holdings Class C Special Interest\nbased on our performance, as determined on a portfolio-by-portfolio basis. Investments made during each two-year period are grouped together as separate\nportfolios (each, a “Portfolio”). Subject to certain conditions, at the end of each fiscal quarter, EPA Holdings is entitled to a distribution from RP Holdings in\nrespect of each Portfolio equal to 20% of the Net Economic Profit (defined as the aggregate cash receipts for all new portfolio investments in such Portfolio\nless Total Expenses (defined as interest expense, operating expense and recovery of acquisition cost in respect of such Portfolio)) for such Portfolio for the\napplicable measuring period (the “Equity Performance Awards”). The Equity Performance Awards will be allocated to EPA Holdings, as the holder of the RP\nHoldings Class C Special Interest, and recorded as Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Equity Performance Awards will be payable in RP Holdings Class B Interests that will be exchanged upon issuance for Class A ordinary shares. EPA\nHoldings may also receive a periodic cash advance in respect of the RP Holdings Class C Special Interest to the extent necessary for EPA Holdings or any of its\nbeneficial owners to pay when due any income tax imposed on it or them as a result of holding such RP Holdings Class C Special Interest. The Equity\nPerformance Awards will be reflected as a transaction between equity holders in the condensed consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity and related\nperiodic cash distributions will be presented as a financing activity in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. We do not expect any material\nEquity Performance Awards to be payable until certain performance conditions discussed above are met. Similarly, we do not expect any material income to be\nallocated to EPA Holdings until such performance conditions are met.\n21\nROYALTY PHARMA PLC\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nDividends\nThe holders of Class A ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends subject to approval by our board of directors. The holders of Class B ordinary\nshares do not have any rights to receive dividends; however, RP Holdings Class B Interests are entitled to dividends and distributions from RP Holdings. In the\nfirst nine months of 2024, we declared and paid three quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per Class A ordinary share in an aggregate amount of $282.8 million to\nholders of our Class A ordinary shares.\n2020 Independent Directors Equity Incentive Plan and Share-based Compensation\nOn June 15, 2020, our 2020 Independent Director Equity Incentive Plan was approved and became effective, whereby 800 thousand Class A ordinary\nshares were authorized for issuance in the form of RSUs to our independent directors. RSUs granted under the plan generally vest over one year with the\nassociated share-based compensation expense recorded as part of General and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nIn the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we did not recognize material share-based compensation expenses.\n11.

(“Teva”) to acquire a royalty interest in TEV-’749. Under this agreement, we are committed to fund up to $100 million of the ongoing development of\nTEV-’749. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, we funded $19.6 million and $82.0 million, respectively. Our funding to acquire the royalty\ninterest is classified as a financial royalty asset. As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded commitments of $18.0 million under this agreement.\n23\nROYALTY PHARMA PLC\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nOther Commitments\nWe have commitments to advance funds to counterparties through our investment in the Avillion Entities. Please refer to Note 7–Non-Consolidated\nAffiliates for details of these arrangements. We also have requirements to make Operating and Personnel Payments (defined below) over the life of the\nManagement Agreement as described in Note 14–Related Party Transactions.\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may enter into contracts or agreements that contain customary indemnifications relating to such things as\nconfidentiality agreements and representations as to corporate existence and authority to enter into contracts. The maximum exposure under such agreements is\nindeterminable until a claim, if any, is made. However, no such claims have been made against us to date and we believe that the likelihood of such\nproceedings taking place in the future is remote.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are a party to legal actions with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business. Some of these proceedings may be based on\ncomplex claims involving substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Unless otherwise noted, it is not possible to determine the probability of loss\nor estimate damages, and therefore we have not established accruals for any of these proceedings on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. When we determine that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability, and, if the\nliability is material, we disclose the amount of the liability reserved. We do not believe the outcome of any existing legal proceedings to which we are a party,\neither individually or in the aggregate, will adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n14. Related Party Transactions\nThe Manager\nThe Manager is the investment manager of Royalty Pharma plc and its subsidiaries. The managing member of the Manager, Pablo Legorreta, holds an\ninterest in us and serves as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors.\nIn connection with the Exchange Offer, the Manager entered into the Management Agreement with us and our subsidiaries, the Continuing Investors\nPartnerships, and with the Legacy Investors Partnerships. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, we pay a quarterly operating and personnel payment to the\nManager or its affiliates (“Operating and Personnel Payments”) equal to 6.5% of the cash receipts from Royalty Investments (as defined in the Management\nAgreement) for such quarter and 0.25% of the value of our security investments under GAAP as of the end of such quarter. The operating and personnel\npayment for Old RPI, an obligation of the Legacy Investors Partnerships and for which the expense is reflected on our consolidated net income, is calculated as\nthe greater of $1 million per quarter and 0.3125% of royalties from Royalty Investments (as defined in the limited partnership agreements of the Legacy\nInvestors Partnerships) during the previous twelve calendar months. Additionally, we also pay certain costs and expenses of the Manager.\nTotal operating and personnel payments incurred, including the amounts attributable to Old RPI, are recognized within General and administrative\nexpenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, total operating and personnel\npayments incurred, including the amounts attributable to Old RPI, were $49.5 million and $138.9 million, respectively. During the third quarter and first nine\nmonths of 2023, total operating and personnel payments incurred, including the amounts attributable to Old RPI, were $43.0 million and $154.9 million,\nrespectively.\n24\nROYALTY PHARMA PLC\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nDistributions Payable to Legacy Non-Controlling Interests\nThe contractual cash flows required to be distributed based on the Legacy Investors Partnerships’ non-controlling interest in Old RPI and RPI ICAV are\npresented in the Distributions payable to legacy non-controlling interests on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAcquisition from Bristol Myers Squibb\nIn November 2017, RPI Acquisitions (Ireland), Limited (“RPI Acquisitions”), a consolidated subsidiary, entered into a purchase agreement with Bristol\nMyers Squibb (“BMS”) to acquire from BMS a percentage of its future royalties on worldwide sales of Onglyza, Farxiga and related diabetes products\nmarketed by AstraZeneca (the “Purchase Agreement”). On December 8, 2017, RPI Acquisitions entered into a purchase, sale and assignment agreement\n(“Assignment Agreement”) with a wholly-owned subsidiary of BioPharma Credit PLC (“BPCR”), an entity related to us. Under the terms of the Assignment\nAgreement, RPI Acquisitions assigned the benefit of 50% of the payment stream acquired from BMS to BPCR in consideration for BPCR meeting 50% of the\nfunding obligations owed to BMS under the Purchase Agreement.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the financial royalty asset of $52.8 million and $75.6 million, respectively, on the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets represented only our right to the future payment streams acquired from BMS.\nOther Transactions\nIn January 2024, we acquired a royalty interest in ecopipam which was previously owned by Psyadon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Psyadon”). Errol De Souza,\nPh.D., an independent director on our board of directors, was a shareholder of Psyadon. In connection with this transaction, Dr. De Souza received an upfront\npayment of $2.5 million and could receive milestone payments of up to $2.22 million in the future.\nHenry Fernandez, the lead independent director of our board of directors, serves as the chairman and chief executive officer of MSCI Inc. (“MSCI”). On\nApril 16, 2021, we entered into an agreement with MSCI with an initial term of seven years to develop thematic life sciences indexes. In return, we will receive\na percentage of MSCI’s revenues from those indexes. No amounts were due from MSCI as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The financial\nimpact associated with this transaction has not been material to date.\nIn connection with the Exchange Offer, we acquired the Legacy SLP Interest from the Continuing Investors Partnerships in exchange for issuing shares in\nour subsidiary. As a result, we became a special limited partner in the Legacy Investors Partnerships. The Legacy Investors Partnerships own a non-controlling\ninterest in Old RPI and RPI ICAV. Refer to Note 7–Non-Consolidated Affiliates for additional discussion of the Legacy SLP Interest and our investments in\nother non-consolidated entities.\nRPIFT owns 27,210 limited partnership interests in the Continuing Investors Partnerships, whose only substantive operations are their investment in our\nsubsidiaries. The total investment of $4.3 million was recorded as treasury interests, of which $1.6 million were held by non-controlling interests as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nEach Continuing Investor Partnership pays a pro rata portion based on its ownership percentage of RP Holdings of any costs and expenses in connection\nwith the contemplation of, formation of, listing and ongoing operation of us and any of our subsidiaries, including any third-party expenses of managing us and\nany of our subsidiaries, such as accounting, audit, legal, reporting, compliance, administration (including directors’ fees), financial advisory, consulting,\ninvestor relations and insurance expenses relating to our affairs and those of any subsidiary.\n15. Subsequent Events\nIn November 2024, we acquired a royalty interest on Niktimvo from Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for an upfront payment of $350 million.\n25\nItem 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader\nunderstand our results of operations, cash flows, other changes in financial condition and business performance. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and\nshould be read in conjunction with, our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes\nincluded in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those\nset forth in Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part II, Item 1A. Risk\nFactors.\nRoyalty Pharma plc is a public limited company that was incorporated under the laws of England and Wales to facilitate our initial public offering\n(“IPO”) in 2020. “Royalty Pharma,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Royalty Pharma plc and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are the largest buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties and a leading funder of innovation across the biopharmaceutical industry. Since our founding in\n1996, we have been pioneers in the royalty market, collaborating with innovators from academic institutions, research hospitals and not-for-profits through\nsmall and mid-cap biotechnology companies to leading global pharmaceutical companies. We have assembled a portfolio of royalties which entitles us to\npayments based directly on the top-line sales of many of the industry’s leading therapies, which includes royalties on more than 35 commercial products,\nincluding Vertex’s Trikafta, GSK’s Trelegy, Roche’s Evrysdi, Johnson & Johnson’s Tremfya, Biogen’s Tysabri and Spinraza, AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson’s\nImbruvica, Astellas and Pfizer’s Xtandi, Novartis’ Promacta, Pfizer’s Nurtec ODT, Gilead’s Trodelvy, among others, and 15 development-stage product\ncandidates. We fund innovation in the biopharmaceutical industry both directly and indirectly - directly when we partner with companies to co-fund late-stage\nclinical trials and new product launches in exchange for future royalties, and indirectly when we acquire existing royalties from the original innovators.\nBackground and Format of Presentation\nWe consummated an exchange offer on February 11, 2020 (the “Exchange Offer”) to facilitate our IPO. Through the Exchange Offer, investors which\nrepresented 82% of the aggregate limited partnership interests in the various partnerships (the “Legacy Investors Partnerships”) that owned Royalty Pharma\nInvestments, an Irish unit trust (“Old RPI”), exchanged their limited partnership interests in the Legacy Investors Partnerships for limited partnership interests\nin RPI US Partners 2019, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, or RPI International Holdings 2019, LP, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership\n(together, the “Continuing Investors Partnerships”).\nWe operate and control the business affairs of Royalty Pharma Holdings Ltd (“RP Holdings”). We include RP Holdings and its subsidiaries in our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements. RP Holdings is the sole owner of Royalty Pharma Investments 2019 ICAV (“RPI 2019 ICAV”), which is an Irish\ncollective asset management vehicle and is the successor to Old RPI.\nFollowing the Exchange Offer, we became the indirect owner of an 82% economic interest in Old RPI through our subsidiary RPI 2019 Intermediate\nFinance Trust, a Delaware statutory trust. We are entitled to 82% of the economics of Old RPI’s wholly-owned subsidiary RPI Finance Trust, a Delaware\nstatutory trust (“RPIFT”), and 66% of Royalty Pharma Collection Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (“RPCT”). Prior to December 29, 2023, the remaining 34%\nof RPCT was owned by the Legacy Investors Partnerships and Royalty Pharma Select Finance Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (“RPSFT”), which was wholly\nowned by Royalty Pharma Select, an Irish unit trust.\nIn 2022, we became an indirect owner of an 82% economic interest in Royalty Pharma Investments ICAV (“RPI ICAV”), which was previously owned\ndirectly by Old RPI.\n26\nIn December 2023, RPI 2019 ICAV acquired the remaining interest in RPCT owned by RPSFT and, as such, RPSFT no longer holds a non-controlling\ninterest in RPCT. Prior to December 2023, we reported non-controlling interest related to a de minimis interest in RPCT held by RPSFT, which also existed\nprior to our IPO.\nUnderstanding Our Financial Reporting\nOur portfolio of investments contains royalties and royalty-like terms held through different forms or instruments. Most of the royalties we acquire are\ntreated as investments in cash flow streams and are classified as financial assets measured under the effective interest method in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Under this accounting methodology, we calculate the effective interest rate on each financial\nroyalty asset using a forecast of the expected cash flows to be received over the life of the financial royalty asset relative to the initial acquisition price. The\nyield, which is calculated at the end of each reporting period and applied prospectively, is then recognized via accretion into our income at the effective rate of\nreturn over the expected life of the financial royalty asset.\nThe measurement of income from our financial royalty assets requires significant judgments and estimates, including management’s judgment in\nforecasting the expected future cash flows of the underlying royalties and the expected duration of the financial royalty asset. Our cash flow forecasts are\nupdated each reporting period primarily using sell-side equity research analysts’ consensus sales estimates for each of the products in which we own royalties.\nWe then calculate our expected royalty receipts by applying our royalty terms to these consensus sales forecasts. As we update our forecasted cash flows on a\nperiodic basis and recalculate the present value of the remaining future cash flows, any shortfall when compared to the carrying value of the financial royalty\nasset is recorded directly in the income statement as non-cash provision expense. If, in a subsequent period, there is an increase in expected cash flows or if\nactual cash flows are greater than cash flows previously expected, we reverse the provision expense previously recorded in part or in full by recording a non-\ncash credit to the provision.\nAs a result of the non-cash charges associated with applying the effective interest method accounting methodology to our financial royalty assets, our\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations activity can be volatile and unpredictable. Small declines in sell-side equity research analysts’ consensus sales\nforecasts over a long time horizon can result in an immediate non-cash income statement expense recognition, even though the applicable cash inflows will not\nbe realized for many years into the future. For example, in late 2014 we acquired the cystic fibrosis franchise and shortly after, declines in near-term sales\nforecasts of sell-side equity research analysts caused us to recognize non-cash provision expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Over\nthe course of 10 quarters, we continued to recognize non-cash provision expense because of these changes in sales forecasts, ultimately reaching a peak\ncumulative allowance of $1.30 billion by September 30, 2017. With the approval of the Vertex triple combination therapy, Trikafta, in October 2019, sell-side\nequity research analysts’ consensus sales forecasts increased to reflect the larger addressable market and the extension of the expected duration of the Trikafta\nroyalty, resulting in the reversal of the remaining $1.10 billion cumulative allowance. The recognition of the associated non-cash provision income of $1.10\nbillion in 2019 was not tied to royalty receipts, but rather to the increase in sales forecasts. This example illustrates the volatility caused by our accounting\nmodel in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nWe believe there is no direct correlation between income from financial royalty assets and royalty receipts due to the nature of the accounting\nmethodology applied for financial royalty assets. Further, income from financial royalty assets and the provision for changes in expected cash flows related to\nthese financial royalty assets can be volatile and unpredictable.\nOur operations have historically been financed primarily with cash flows generated by our royalties. Given the importance of cash flows and their\npredictability to management’s operation of the business, management uses Portfolio Receipts (as defined below) as a primary measure of our operating\nperformance. See “—Portfolio Overview” for additional discussion regarding Portfolio Receipts.\nUnderstanding Our Results of Operations\nWe report non-controlling interests related to the portion of ownership interests of consolidated subsidiaries not owned by us and which are attributable\nto:\n1. The Legacy Investors Partnerships’ ownership of approximately 18% of Old RPI and RPI ICAV. The value of this non-controlling interest will decline\nover time as the assets in Old RPI and RPI ICAV expire.\n27\n2. A de minimis interest in RPCT held by RPSFT. In December 2023, we acquired the remaining interest in RPCT that was held by RPSFT and, as such,\nRPSFT no longer holds a non-controlling interest in RPCT.\nThe Legacy Investors Partnership together with RPSFT are referred to as the “legacy non-controlling interests.” The legacy non-controlling interests are\nthe only historical non-controlling interests that existed prior to our IPO.\nAdditionally, following the consummation of our IPO, we also report non-controlling interests related to:\n3. The Continuing Investors Partnerships’ ownership in RP Holdings through their ownership of RP Holdings Class B Interests was approximately 24% as\nof September 30, 2024. RP Holdings Class B Interests are exchangeable into Class A ordinary shares. As the Continuing Investors Partnerships conduct\nexchanges, the Continuing Investors Partnerships’ ownership in RP Holdings decreases and the value of this non-controlling interest decreases. Additionally,\nRP Holdings began to retire RP Holdings Class A Interests held by us in connection with our repurchase of Class A ordinary shares. As RP Holdings retires RP\nHoldings Class A Interests, our ownership in RP Holdings decreases and the value of this non-controlling interest increases.\nThe Continuing Investors Partnerships are referred to as the “continuing non-controlling interests.”\n4. RPI EPA Holdings, LP’s (“EPA Holdings”) ownership of RP Holdings’ Class C ordinary share (the “RP Holdings Class C Special Interest”).\nEPA Holdings is entitled to receive equity distributions through its RP Holdings Class C Special Interest (“Equity Performance Awards”). Equity\nPerformance Awards owed to EPA Holdings will be recognized as an equity transaction when the obligation becomes due and will impact the income allocated\nto non-controlling interest related to the RP Holdings Class C Special Interest. The Equity Performance Awards will be payable in RP Holdings Class B\nInterests that will be exchanged upon issuance for Class A ordinary shares. EPA Holdings may also receive a periodic cash advance in respect of the RP\nHoldings Class C Special Interest to the extent necessary for EPA Holdings or any of its beneficial owners to pay when due any income tax imposed on it or\nthem as a result of holding such RP Holdings Class C Special Interest. We currently expect Equity Performance Awards to become payable in 2025 when\ncertain performance conditions are projected to be met.\nTotal income and other revenues\nTotal income and other revenues is primarily comprised of interest income from our financial royalty assets and royalty income generally arising from\nsuccessful commercialization of products developed through research and development (“R&D”) funding arrangements. Most of our royalties are classified as\nfinancial assets as our ownership rights are generally protective and passive in nature. In certain instances, we may acquire a royalty that includes more\nsubstantial rights or ownership of the underlying intellectual property, we classify such royalties as intangible assets and recognize revenue from these\nintangible royalty assets.\nThe royalty payors that accounted for greater than 10% of our total income and other revenues are shown in the table below:\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\nRoyalty Payor Royalty 2024 2023 2024 2023\nVertex Cystic fibrosis franchise 36 % 41 % 37 % 36 %\nRoche Evrysdi, Mircera 10 % * 10 % *\n*Represents less than 10%.\n28\nIncome from financial royalty assets\nOur financial royalty assets represent investments in cash flow streams with yield components that most closely resemble loans measured at amortized\ncost under the effective interest method. We calculate the effective interest rate using forecasted expected cash flows to be received over the life of the royalty\nasset relative to the initial acquisition price. Interest income is recognized at the effective rate of return over the expected life of the asset, which is calculated at\nthe end of each reporting period and applied prospectively. As changes in sell-side equity research analysts’ consensus sales estimates are updated on a\nquarterly basis, the effective rate of return changes. For example, if sell-side equity research analysts’ consensus sales forecasts increase, the yield to derive\nincome on a financial royalty asset will increase and result in higher income for subsequent periods.\nVariables affecting the recognition of interest income from financial royalty assets under the prospective effective interest method include any one of the\nfollowing: (1) additional acquisitions, (2) changes in expected cash flows of the underlying pharmaceutical products, derived primarily from sell-side equity\nresearch analysts’ consensus sales forecasts, (3) regulatory approval of additional indications which leads to new cash flow streams, (4) changes to the\nestimated duration of the royalty (e.g., patent expiration date), (5) changes in amounts and timing of projected royalty receipts and milestone payments and (6)\nchanges in the portion of sales that are subject to the royalty, which is referred to as royalty bearing sales. Our financial royalty assets are directly linked to\nsales of underlying pharmaceutical products whose life cycle typically peaks at a point in time, followed frequently by declining sales trends due to the entry of\ngeneric competition, resulting in natural declines in the asset balance and periodic interest income over the life of our royalties. The recognition of interest\nincome from royalties requires management to make estimates and assumptions around many factors, including those impacting the variables noted above.\nOther royalty income and revenues\nOther royalty income and revenues primarily includes income from financial royalty assets that have been fully amortized and income from synthetic\nroyalties and milestones arising out of R&D funding arrangements. Occasionally, a royalty asset may be amortized on an accelerated basis due to collectability\nconcerns, which, if resolved, may result in future cash collections when no financial royalty asset remains. Similarly, we may continue to collect royalties on a\nfully amortized financial royalty asset beyond the estimated duration. In each scenario where a financial royalty asset has been fully amortized, income from\nsuch royalty is recognized as Other royalty income and revenues.\nOther royalty income and revenues also includes revenues from intangible royalty assets and income from royalties that are recorded at fair value on our\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets.\nProvision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets\nThe Provision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets includes the following:\n• non-cash expense or income related to the current period activity resulting from adjustments to the cumulative allowance for changes in expected\ncash flows; and\n• non-cash expense or income related to the provision for current expected credit losses, which reflects the activity for the period, primarily due to\nnew financial royalty assets with limited protective rights and changes to cash flow estimates for financial royalty assets with limited protective\nrights.\nAs discussed above, income is accreted on our financial royalty assets using the effective interest method. As we update our forecasted cash flows on a\nperiodic basis and recalculate the present value of the remaining future cash flows, any shortfall when compared to the carrying value of the financial royalty\nasset is recorded directly in the condensed consolidated statements of operations through the line item Provision for changes in expected cash flows from\nfinancial royalty assets. If, in a subsequent period, there is an increase in expected cash flows or if actual cash flows are greater than cash flows previously\nexpected, we reverse the provision expense previously recorded in part or in full by recording a credit to the provision.\nThe same variables and management’s estimates affecting the recognition of interest income on our financial royalty assets noted above also directly\nimpact the provision.\n29\nR&D funding expense\nR&D funding expense consists of payments that we have made to counterparties to acquire royalties or milestones on product candidates. It includes\ndevelopment-stage funding payments to counterparties that are made upfront or upon pre-approval milestones, and development-stage funding payments that\nare made to counterparties over time as the related product candidates undergo clinical trials with our counterparties.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses include primarily Operating and Personnel Payments (defined below), legal expenses, other expenses for\nprofessional services and share-based compensation. The expenses incurred in respect of Operating and Personnel Payments comprise the most significant\ncomponent of G&A expenses on an ongoing basis.\nUnder the Management Agreement, we pay a quarterly operating and personnel payment to the Manager or its affiliates (“Operating and Personnel\nPayments”) equal to 6.5% of the cash receipts from Royalty Investments (as defined in the Management Agreement), or Portfolio Receipts for such quarter,\nand 0.25% of the value of our security investments under GAAP as of the end of such quarter.\nThe operating and personnel payments for Old RPI, an obligation of the Legacy Investors Partnerships as a non-controlling interest in Old RPI and for\nwhich the expense is reflected in G&A expenses, are calculated as the greater of $1 million per quarter and 0.3125% of royalties from Royalty Investments (as\ndefined in the limited partnership agreements of the Legacy Investors Partnerships) during the previous twelve calendar months.\nEquity in (earnings)/losses of equity method investees\nEquity in (earnings)/losses of equity method investees primarily includes the results of our share of income or loss from the following non-consolidated\naffiliates:\n1. Legacy SLP Interest. In connection with the Exchange Offer, we acquired an equity method investment from the Continuing Investors Partnerships in\nthe form of a special limited partnership interest in the Legacy Investors Partnerships (the “Legacy SLP Interest”) in exchange for issuing shares in our\nsubsidiary. The Legacy SLP Interest entitles us to the equivalent of performance distribution payments that would have been paid to the general\npartner of the Legacy Investors Partnerships and a performance income allocation on a similar basis. As the Legacy Investors Partnerships no longer\nparticipate in investment opportunities, the value of the Legacy SLP Interest is expected to decline over time.\n2. The Avillion Entities. The Avillion Entities (as defined below) partner with global biopharmaceutical companies to perform R&D in exchange for\nsuccess-based milestones or royalties if products are commercialized. Our investments in Avillion Financing I, LP (“Avillion I”) and BAv Financing\nII, LP (“Avillion II” and together with Avillion I, the “Avillion Entities”) are accounted for using the equity method.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net primarily includes the changes in fair market value of our equity securities, derivative instruments and available for sale debt securities,\nincluding related forwards and funding commitments, and interest income.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\nThe net income attributable to non-controlling interests includes income attributable to the legacy non-controlling interests and the continuing non-\ncontrolling interests. Following our acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest in RPCT held by RPSFT in December 2023, and since the Legacy\nInvestors Partnerships no longer participate in investment opportunities, the related net income attributable to the legacy non-controlling interests is expected to\ncontinue to decline over time as the assets held by Old RPI and RPI ICAV mature.\n30\nNet income attributable to the continuing non-controlling interests includes RP Holdings Class B Interests held by the Continuing Investors Partnerships\nand will include net income attributable to the RP Holdings Class C Special Interest held by EPA Holdings once certain performance conditions have been met,\nwhich is expected to occur in 2025. Future net income attributable to the non-controlling interest related to RP Holdings Class B Interests held by the\nContinuing Investors Partnerships will decline over time if the investors who indirectly own RP Holdings Class B Interests conduct exchanges for our Class A\nordinary shares.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests above can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily driven by volatility in the income\nstatement activity of the respective underlying entity as a result of the non-cash charges associated with applying the effective interest accounting methodology\nto our financial royalty assets as described in section titled “Understanding Our Financial Reporting.”\nResults of Operations\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations is as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ % 2024 2023 $ %\nIncome and other revenues\nIncome from financial royalty assets $ 533,166 $ 508,657 24,509 4.8 $ 1,587,577 $ 1,674,689 (87,112) (5.2)\nOther royalty income and revenues 31,524 27,656 3,868 14.0 82,358 83,797 (1,439) (1.7)\nTotal income and other revenues 564,690 536,313 28,377 5.3 1,669,935 1,758,486 (88,551) (5.0)\nOperating (income)/expense\nProvision for changes in expected cash flows from\nfinancial royalty assets (227,604) 277,137 (504,741) * 568,425 637,169 (68,744) (10.8)\nResearch and development funding expense 500 50,500 (50,000) (99.0) 1,500 51,500 (50,000) (97.1)\nGeneral and administrative expenses 56,720 57,234 (514) (0.9) 169,080 190,563 (21,483) (11.3)\nTotal operating (income)/expense, net (170,384) 384,871 (555,255) * 739,005 879,232 (140,227) (15.9)\nOperating income 735,074 151,442 583,632 385.4 930,930 879,254 51,676 5.9\nOther (income)/expense\nEquity in (earnings)/losses of equity method investees (10,407) 5,222 (15,629) * 2,039 (28,614) 30,653 *\nInterest expense 66,506 46,033 20,473 44.5 159,751 139,932 19,819 14.2\nOther income, net (127,383) (21,890) (105,493) 481.9 (227,322) (214,566) (12,756) 5.9\nTotal other (income)/expense, net (71,284) 29,365 (100,649) * (65,532) (103,248) 37,716 (36.5)\nConsolidated net income 806,358 122,077 684,281 560.5 996,462 982,502 13,960 1.4\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests 262,371 49,963 212,408 425.1 345,693 342,008 3,685 1.1\nNet income attributable to Royalty Pharma plc $ 543,987 $ 72,114 471,873 654.3 $ 650,769 $ 640,494 10,275 1.6\n*Percentage change is not meaningful.\n31\nTotal income and other revenues\nIncome from financial royalty assets\nIncome from financial royalty assets by top products is as follows, in order of contribution to income for the first nine months of 2024 (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change September 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ % 2024 2023 $ %\nCystic fibrosis franchise $ 205,701 $ 218,938 (13,237) (6.0) $ 619,113 $ 631,813 (12,700) (2.0)\nEvrysdi 56,747 20,519 36,228 176.6 166,277 58,005 108,272 186.7\nTrelegy 37,593 32,234 5,359 16.6 110,272 96,571 13,701 14.2\nTremfya 37,293 36,937 356 1.0 109,137 114,422 (5,285) (4.6)\nImbruvica 32,139 38,463 (6,324) (16.4) 100,280 136,785 (36,505) (26.7)\nTysabri 30,355 42,682 (12,327) (28.9) 93,722 130,658 (36,936) (28.3)\nOther products 133,338 118,884 14,454 12.2 388,776 506,435 (117,659) (23.2)\nTotal income from financial royalty assets $ 533,166 $ 508,657 24,509 4.8 $ 1,587,577 $ 1,674,689 (87,112) (5.2)\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIncome from financial royalty assets increased by $24.5 million, or 4.8%, in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily\ndue to an increase in income from Evrysdi attributable to the incremental royalties that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2023 and second quarter of 2024.\nThe increase was partially offset by the declines in sell-side equity research analysts’ consensus sales forecast for cystic fibrosis franchise.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIncome from financial royalty assets decreased by $87.1 million, or 5.2%, in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023,\nprimarily due to the March 2023 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval of Pfizer’s Zavzpret. This FDA approval resulted in our receipt of a\n$475.0 million milestone payment and $153.6 million of interest income recognized in the first quarter of 2023 as reflected within other products in the above\ntable, which were non-recurring. The decrease was partially offset by the increase in income from Evrysdi in 2024 attributable to the incremental royalties that\nwe acquired in the fourth quarter of 2023 and second quarter of 2024.\nOther royalty income and revenues\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nOther royalty income and revenues increased by $3.9 million, or 14.0%, in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily\nrelated to the sales growth of Nurtec ODT and Trodelvy, partially offset by the decrease in the income from fully amortized financial royalty assets.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nOther royalty income and revenues were relatively flat in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023.\n32\nProvision for changes in expected cash flows from financial royalty assets\nProvision activity is a combination of income and expense items.

We recorded provision income for changes in expected cash flows\nprimarily related to Tysabri, Xtandi, cystic fibrosis franchise and Evrysdi due to increases in sell-side equity research analysts’ consensus sales forecasts. The\nprovision expense for credit losses was primarily driven by the addition of Yorvipath to our portfolio.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we recorded provision expense of $277.1 million, comprised of $247.2 million in provision expense for changes in expected\ncash flows and $29.9 million in provision expense for current expected credit losses. We recorded provision expense for changes in expected cash flows\nprimarily related to Tysabri, Xtandi and Tremfya due to declines in sell-side equity research analysts’ consensus sales forecasts. The provision expense for\ncredit losses was primarily driven by the additions of Skytrofa and Adstiladrin to our portfolio.\n33\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn the first nine months of 2024, we recorded provision expense of $568.4 million, comprised of $504.5 million in provision expense for changes in\nexpected cash flows and $64.0 million in provision expense for current expected credit losses. We recorded provision expense for changes in expected cash\nflows primarily related to Evrysdi due to declines in sell-side equity research analysts’ consensus sales forecasts. We recorded provision expense for changes in\nexpected cash flows related to the cystic fibrosis franchise, primarily due to the inclusion of consensus estimates for Vertex’s vanzacaftor triple following\ndisclosure of the Phase 3 clinical data and the conservative assumption that royalties are only collected on the tezacaftor component of the vanzacaftor triple\nand not the deuterated ivacaftor component. Although we believe that the deuterated ivacaftor component of vanzacaftor triple is the same as ivacaftor and is\ntherefore royalty-bearing, Vertex has made public statements that it believes the deuterated ivacaftor component is not royalty-bearing. If deuterated ivacaftor is\ndetermined to be royalty-bearing, we may recognize provision income in our results of operations at that time. Additionally, we recorded provision expense for\nCrysvita due to declines in sales forecasts. The provision expense for credit losses was primarily driven by the additions of Yorvipath, Voranigo and ecopipam\nto our portfolio.\nIn the first nine months of 2023, we recorded provision expense of $637.2 million, comprised of $605.8 million in provision expense for changes in\nexpected cash flows and $31.4 million in provision expense for current expected credit losses. We recorded provision expense for changes in expected cash\nflows for Imbruvica, Tremfya and Tysabri primarily due to declines in sell-side equity research analysts’ consensus sales forecasts. The provision expense for\ncredit losses was primarily driven by the additions of Skytrofa and Adstiladrin to our portfolio.\nR&D funding expense\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nR&D funding expense decreased by $50.0 million, or 99.0% in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023. In the third quarter of\n2023, we recognized R&D funding expense of $50.0 million related to a clinical milestone payment for aficamten.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nR&D funding expense decreased by $50.0 million, or 97.1% in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. In the first\nnine months of 2023, we recognized R&D funding expense of $50.0 million related to a clinical milestone payment for aficamten.\nG&A expenses\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nG&A expenses were relatively flat in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nG&A expenses decreased by $21.5 million, or 11.3%, in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily from lower\nOperating and Personnel Payments in the current period. The higher expense in 2023 was due to higher Portfolio Receipts, which included the one-time receipt\nof a $475.0 million Zavzpret milestone payment in the first quarter 2023.\n34\nEquity in (earnings)/losses of equity method investees\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nEquity in earnings of equity method investees was $10.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to equity in losses of equity method investees of\n$5.2 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by an income allocation from the Legacy SLP Interest of $10.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 as\ncompared to a loss allocation of $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nEquity in losses of equity method investees was $2.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to equity in earnings of equity method\ninvestees of $28.6 million in the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by a loss allocation from the Avillion Entities of $7.6 million in the first nine\nmonths of 2024 as compared to an income allocation of $28.0 million in the first nine months of 2023. The income allocation in the first nine months of 2023\nfrom the Avillion Entities was primarily driven by an $80 million payment the Avillion Entities received related to AstraZeneca’s election to exercise an option\nto commercialize Airsupra in the United States.\nInterest expense\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nInterest expense increased by $20.5 million, or 44.5% in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by the\nissuance of the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in June 2024. The increase was partially offset by the repayment of $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes\nin September 2023 upon maturity.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nInterest expense increased by $19.8 million, or 14.2% in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by\nthe issuance of the $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in June 2024. The weighted average coupon rate on our senior unsecured notes outstanding as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3.06% and 2.24%, respectively.\nRefer to the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for additional discussion of our debt financing arrangements.\nOther income, net\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nOther income, net of $127.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily comprised of $57.7 million of gains on available for sale debt securities,\n$50.8 million of gains on equity securities and $17.5 million of interest income. The gains on available for sale debt securities were primarily driven by the\nchanges in fair value of the Cytokinetics Funding Arrangements.\nOther income, net of $21.9 million in the third quarter of 2023 was primarily comprised of $23.4 million of interest income earned on cash and cash\nequivalents held at financial institutions.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nOther income, net of $227.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 was primarily comprised of $103.9 million of gains on available for sale debt\nsecurities, $81.5 million of gains on equity securities and $38.3 million of interest income. The gains on available for sale debt securities were primarily driven\nby the changes in fair value of the MorphoSys Development Funding Bonds.\n35\nOther income, net of $214.6 million in the first nine months of 2023 was primarily comprised of $122.5 million of gains on available for sale debt\nsecurities, $65.8 million of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents held at financial institutions and $32.0 million of gains on equity securities.\nThe gains on available for sale debt securities were primarily driven by the change in fair value of the MorphoSys Development Funding Bonds.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nNet income attributable to the Legacy Investors Partnerships increased by $61.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of\n2023, primarily driven by higher net income attributable to Old RPI as a result of lower provision expense in the current year period.\nNet income attributable to the Continuing Investors Partnerships increased by $151.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter\nof 2023, primarily driven by higher net income attributable to RP Holdings in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by a decline in the Continuing Investors\nPartnerships’ ownership of RP Holdings resulting from the exchanges by investors in the Continuing Investors Partnerships who indirectly own RP Holdings\nClass B Interests for our Class A ordinary shares.\nNet income attributable to RPSFT was $0.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. In December 2023, RPI 2019 ICAV acquired the remaining interest in\nRPCT owned by RPSFT and, as such, RPSFT no longer holds a non-controlling interest in RPCT.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nNet income attributable to the Legacy Investors Partnerships increased by $23.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine\nmonths of 2023, primarily driven by higher income attributable to Old RPI as a result of lower provision expense in the current year period.\nNet income attributable to the Continuing Investors Partnerships decreased by $15.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine\nmonths of 2023, primarily due to lower net income attributable to RP Holdings as a result of lower interest income recognized in 2024. The higher interest\nincome in 2023 was primarily driven by $153.6 million of interest income recognized following the FDA’s approval of Pfizer’s Zavzpret, which was non-\nrecurring. Additionally, the exchanges by investors in the Continuing Investors Partnerships who indirectly own RP Holdings Class B Interests for our Class A\nordinary shares resulted in a decline in the Continuing Investors Partnerships’ ownership of RP Holdings.\nNet income attributable to RPSFT was $4.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. In December 2023, RPI 2019 ICAV acquired the remaining interest\nin RPCT owned by RPSFT and, as such, RPSFT no longer holds a non-controlling interest in RPCT.\nPortfolio Overview\nOur business model is different from that of traditional operating companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. Our operating performance is a function of\nour liquidity as our operations have historically been financed primarily with cash flows generated by our royalties. We use the cash generated by our existing\nroyalties to fund investments in new royalties. We consider a variety of metrics in assessing the performance of our business. Portfolio Receipts is a key\nperformance metric that represents our ability to generate cash from our portfolio investments, the primary source of capital that we can deploy to make new\nportfolio investments. Portfolio Receipts also enables management to better analyze our liquidity and long-term growth prospects by providing a more granular\nproduct-by-product presentation of the underlying cash generation of our royalty investments.\n36\nPortfolio Receipts is defined as the sum of royalty receipts and milestones and other contractual receipts. Royalty receipts include variable payments\nbased on sales of products, net of contractual payments to the legacy non-controlling interests, that are attributed to us (“Royalty Receipts”). Milestones and\nother contractual receipts include sales-based or regulatory milestones payments and other fixed contractual receipts, net of contractual payments to the legacy\nnon-controlling interests, that are attributed to us. Portfolio Receipts does not include proceeds from equity securities or proceeds from purchases and sales of\nmarketable securities, both of which are not central to our fundamental business strategy.\nPortfolio Receipts is calculated as the sum of the following line items from our GAAP statements of cash flows: Cash collections from financial royalty\nassets, Cash collections from intangible royalty assets, Other royalty cash collections, Proceeds from available for sale debt securities and Distributions from\nequity method investees less Distributions to legacy non-controlling interests - Portfolio Receipts, which represent contractual distributions of Royalty\nReceipts, milestones and other contractual receipts to RPSFT and the Legacy Investors Partnerships.\nOur portfolio consists of royalties on more than 35 marketed therapies and 15 development-stage product candidates. The therapies in our portfolio\naddress therapeutic areas such as rare disease, cancer, neuroscience, infectious disease, hematology and diabetes, and are delivered to patients across both\nprimary and specialty care settings. The table below shows Portfolio Receipts, including Royalty Receipts by product and milestones and other contractual\nreceipts, in order of contribution to total Royalty Receipts for the first nine months of 2024 (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months For the Nine Months Ended\nEnded September 30, Change September 30, Change\nTherapeutic\nProducts Marketer(s) Area 2024 2023 $ % 2024 2023 $ %\nCystic fibrosis\nfranchise(1) Vertex Rare disease $ 206,988 $ 195,954 11,034 5.6 $ 620,218 $ 563,251 56,967 10.1\nTrelegy GSK Respiratory 90,541 58,240 32,301 55.5 209,615 143,111 66,504 46.5\nTysabri Biogen Neuroscience 68,262 71,464 (3,202) (4.5) 201,171 211,771 (10,600) (5.0)\nAbbVie, Johnson\nImbruvica & Johnson Cancer 46,198 51,245 (5,047) (9.8) 145,389 159,814 (14,425) (9.0)\nXtandi Pfizer, Astellas Cancer 43,311 38,837 4,474 11.5 122,939 108,275 14,664 13.5\nEvrysdi Roche Rare disease 47,953 15,749 32,204 204.5 117,832 46,318 71,514 154.4\nPromacta Novartis Hematology 41,810 44,609 (2,799) (6.3) 114,856 117,376 (2,520) (2.1)\nJohnson &\nTremfya Johnson Immunology 34,264 27,194 7,070 26.0 100,336 81,117 19,219 23.7\nExelixis, Ipsen,\nCabometyx/Cometriq Takeda Cancer 18,527 17,294 1,233 7.1 53,092 48,234 4,858 10.1\nTrodelvy Gilead Cancer 11,473 9,114 2,359 25.9 32,129 23,191 8,938 38.5\nSpinraza Biogen Rare disease 14,186 15,253 (1,067) (7.0) 30,422 27,815 2,607 9.4\nJohnson &\nErleada Johnson Cancer 10,025 7,723 2,302 29.8 28,230 18,793 9,437 50.2\nOrladeyo BioCryst Rare disease 10,358 7,776 2,582 33.2 27,592 21,130 6,462 30.6\nNurtec\nODT/Zavzpret Pfizer Neuroscience 7,843 5,300 2,543 48.0 18,025 13,347 4,678 35.0\nOther products(2) 80,005 71,408 8,597 12.0 219,515 214,376 5,139 2.4\nRoyalty Receipts $ 731,744 $ 637,160 94,584 14.8 $ 2,041,361 $ 1,797,919 243,442 13.5\nMilestones and other contractual receipts 2,880 — 2,880 n/a 18,241 514,888 (496,647) (96.5)\nPortfolio Receipts $ 734,624 $ 637,160 97,464 15.3 $ 2,059,602 $ 2,312,807 (253,205) (10.9)\n(1) The cystic fibrosis franchise includes the following approved products: Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko/Symkevi and Trikafta/Kaftrio.\n(2) Other products primarily include Royalty Receipts on the following products: Cimzia, Crysvita, Emgality, Entyvio, Farxiga/Onglyza, IDHIFA, Letairis, Lexiscan, Mircera, Nesina, Prevymis,\nSoliqua and distributions from the Legacy SLP Interest, which are presented as Distributions from equity method investees on the statements of cash flows.\n37\nAnalysis of Portfolio Receipts\nThe key drivers of Portfolio Receipts are discussed below:\n• Cystic fibrosis franchise – Royalty Receipts from the cystic fibrosis franchise, including Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko/Symkevi and\nTrikafta/Kaftrio, which are marketed by Vertex for patients with certain mutations causing cystic fibrosis, increased by $57.0 million in the first nine\nmonths of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the continued U.S. performance of Trikafta and\nthe strong uptake of Kaftrio outside of the United States, including its uptake in younger age groups.\n• Trelegy – Royalty Receipts from Trelegy, which is marketed by GSK for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and\nasthma, increased by $66.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by strong patient\ndemand, single inhaler triple therapy class growth and increased market share.\n• Tysabri – Royalty Receipts from Tysabri, which is marketed by Biogen for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, decreased by $10.6 million in the\nfirst nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to pricing pressure and competition.\n• Imbruvica – Royalty Receipts from Imbruvica, which is marketed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson for the treatment of blood cancers and\nchronic graft versus host disease, decreased by $14.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023,\nprimarily due to competitive pressures.\n• Xtandi – Royalty Receipts from Xtandi, which is marketed by Pfizer and Astellas for the treatment of prostate cancer, increased by $14.7 million in\nthe first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by growth in all regions.\n• Evrysdi – Royalty Receipts from Evrysdi, which is marketed by Roche for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy, increased by $71.5 million in\nthe first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily attributable to royalty receipts on the incremental royalties we\nacquired in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2024. The increase is further driven by gains in patient share across all regions.\n• Promacta – Royalty Receipts from Promacta, which is marketed by Novartis for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP)\nand aplastic anemia, decreased by $2.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to higher\nrevenue deductions, partially offset by an increased use of Promacta in chronic ITP and severe aplastic anemia in the United States.\n• Tremfya – Royalty Receipts from Tremfya, which is marketed by Johnson & Johnson for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic\narthritis, increased by $19.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, due to market growth, market\nshare gains and favorable patient mix.\n• Cabometyx/Cometriq – Royalty Receipts from Cabometyx/Cometriq, which is marketed by Exelixis, Ipsen and Takeda, increased by $4.9 million\nin the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by continued demand growth in the United States\nand globally by broad uptake in combination with Opdivo in first-line renal cell carcinoma across clinical risk groups and practice settings.\n• Trodelvy – Royalty Receipts from Trodelvy, which is marketed by Gilead for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic triple-negative breast\ncancer and pre-treated hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer,\nincreased by $8.9 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by\ncontinued demand in second-line metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and pretreated HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer.\n38\n• Spinraza – Royalty Receipts from Spinraza, which is marketed by Biogen for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy, increased by $2.6 million in\nthe first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to relatively consistent U.S. sales, while performance\noutside the United States was impacted by the timing of shipments, competition and pricing pressure. We acquired the Spinraza royalty in the first\nquarter of 2023 and began receiving royalties in the second quarter of 2023.\n• Erleada – Royalty Receipts from Erleada, which is marketed by Johnson & Johnson for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer, increased by\n$9.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by continued share gains and market\ngrowth in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. We acquired an incremental royalty on Erleada in the second quarter of 2023 and began\nreceiving the additional royalty in the third quarter of 2023.\n• Orladeyo – Royalty Receipts from Orladeyo, which is marketed by BioCryst for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, increased by $6.5 million\nin the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by continued strong patient uptake.\n• Nurtec ODT/Zavzpret – Royalty Receipts from Nurtec ODT, which is marketed by Pfizer for the acute treatment of migraine, increased by $4.7\nmillion in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by strong demand in the\nUnited States, as well as recent launches in international markets, partially offset by lower net price in the United States due to unfavorable changes\nin channel mix.\n• Other products – Royalty Receipts from other products increased by $5.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine\nmonths of 2023, primarily driven by the receipt of the underpaid royalties on Tradjenta, higher distributions from the Legacy SLP Interest and the\ntiming of royalty receipts on Entyvio, partially offset by a decline in royalty receipts on Lexiscan due to generic competition.\n• Milestones and other contractual receipts decreased by $496.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of\n2023, primarily due to a $475.0 million milestone payment received following the FDA’s approval of Zavzpret in March 2023 and a $28.7 million\npayment from our joint venture investee, Avillion II, for our pro rata portion of the $80 million fee paid by AstraZeneca to exercise the option to\ncommercialize Airsupra in United States, both of which occurred in the first quarter of 2023.\nKey Developments Relating to Our Portfolio\nRecent key developments related to products in our portfolio are discussed below:\nCommercial Products\n• Skytrofa. In September 2024, Ascendis Pharma announced the submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDA for\nTransCon hGH (marketed as Skytrofa) for the treatment of adults with growth hormone deficiency.\n• Cobenfy. In September 2024, Bristol Myers Squibb announced the FDA approval of Cobenfy (formerly KarXT), a first-in-class muscarinic agonist\nfor the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Following FDA approval of Cobenfy, we will make a $25 million milestone payment to PureTech\nHealth in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n39\n• Cabometyx. In September 2024, Exelixis announced final results from the Phase 3 pivotal CABINET study, which demonstrated a significant\nimprovement in progression-free survival for cabozantinib in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors. Exelixis submitted a supplemental\nNew Drug Application, which was assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of April 2025, and Ipsen has submitted an extension of\nindication Marketing Authorization to the European Medicines Agency.\nIn September 2024, Exelixis announced final results from the Phase 3 pivotal CONTACT-02 study, which achieved one of two primary endpoints,\ndemonstrating a statistically significant benefit in progression-free survival, and a numerical but not statistically significant improvement in overall\nsurvival for cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Exelixis intends to\nsubmit a supplemental New Drug Application with the FDA later this year.\n• Tremfya. In September 2024, Johnson and Johnson announced the FDA approval of Tremfya for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely\nactive ulcerative colitis.\n• Spinraza. In September 2024, Biogen announced the pivotal cohort (Part B) of the Phase 2/3 DEVOTE study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a\nhigher dose regimen of Spinraza in infants with spinal muscular atrophy met its primary endpoint, achieving a statistically significant improvement\nin motor function compared to a prespecified matched sham control group.\n• Voranigo. In August 2024, Servier announced the FDA approval of Voranigo, a first-in-class targeted therapy for patients with isocitrate\ndehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) mutant diffuse glioma.\nDevelopment-Stage Product Candidates\n• Aficamten. In October 2024, Cytokinetics announced that it submitted a New Drug Application for aficamten to the FDA in the third quarter of\n2024. Additionally, Cytokinetics plans to submit a Marketing Authorization Application for aficamten to the European Medicines Agency in the\nfourth quarter of 2024.\n• BCX10013. In August 2024, BioCryst announced that it plans to discontinue development of its oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX10013, as the level of\nclinical activity observed was less than other therapies on the market.\n• MK-8189. In October 2024, Merck updated its public disclosures to remove MK-8189 from its pipeline chart and we do not anticipate making a\nfurther investment in this program.\n• Pelabresib. In October 2024, Novartis announced that based on its review of 48-week data from the Phase 3 MANIFEST-2 study, longer follow-up\ntime is needed to determine the regulatory path for pelabresib in myelofibrosis. Novartis will continue to follow patients in MANIFEST-2 and\nevaluate the potential for additional studies to support registration.\n• Trontinemab. In October 2024, Roche presented its latest Phase 1b/2a interim results for trontinemab at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease\nconference, which demonstrated rapid and robust amyloid plaque depletion after 12 to 28 weeks of treatment and an overall favorable safety profile\nwith very limited ARIA-E observed.\n40\nInvestments Overview\nOngoing investment in new royalties is fundamental to the long-term prospects of our business. New investments provide a source of growth for our\nRoyalty Receipts, supplementing growth within our existing portfolio and offsetting declines for royalties on products that have lost market exclusivity. We\nevaluate an array of royalty acquisition opportunities on a continuous basis and expect to continue to make acquisitions in the ordinary course of our business.\nWe have established a strong track record of identifying, evaluating and investing in royalties tied to leading products across therapeutic areas and treatment\nmodalities. We invest in approved products and development-stage product candidates that have generated robust proof of concept data. We invest in these\ntherapies through the purchase of royalties, milestones and other contractual receipts by making hybrid investments and by acquiring businesses with\nsignificant existing royalty assets or the potential for the creation of such assets.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, we invested $2.2 billion in royalties, milestones and other contractual receipts. While volatility exists in the funding\nof new acquisitions on a year-to-year basis due to the unpredictable timing of new investment opportunities, we have consistently deployed significant amounts\nof cash when measured over multi-year periods. Our approach is rooted in a highly disciplined evaluation process that is not dictated by a minimum annual\ninvestment threshold.\nSummary of Acquisition Activities\n• In November 2024, we acquired a synthetic royalty on Niktimvo from Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for an upfront payment of $350 million.\nNiktimvo is approved for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease and will be co-commercialized by Incyte.

This collaboration includes the following key\ncomponents: a royalty restructuring on aficamten for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; amended commercial launch funding with two additional\ntranches for aficamten of $50 million upfront with the option to draw an additional $175 million following approval of aficamten in oHCM;\ndevelopment funding of $100 million upfront for the confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil for heart failure with reduced\nejection fraction and $50 million upfront for the Phase 2 clinical trial of CK-586 for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which includes an\noption to invest an additional $150 million to fund Phase 3 development of CK-586; and the purchase of $50 million of Cytokinetics’ common\nstock.\n41\n• In May 2024, we acquired royalties and milestones on frexalimab, which was owned by ImmuNext, Inc., for approximately $525 million, including\nestimated transaction costs. We are entitled to receive royalties on annual worldwide net sales of frexalimab and milestones related to the\nachievement of certain commercial and regulatory events. Frexalimab, which is in development by Sanofi, is a second generation anti-CD40 ligand\nmonoclonal antibody. Frexalimab is being evaluated in Phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and is in Phase 2 clinical\nstudies for systemic lupus erythematosus and Type 1 Diabetes.\n• In January 2024, we acquired a royalty interest in ecopipam for an upfront payment of $49 million and up to $44 million in milestone payments\ncontingent on the achievement of certain regulatory milestones.

KarXT is in Phase 3 development by Karuna\nTherapeutics for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological conditions, including schizophrenia as a monotherapy and adjunctive therapy and\npsychosis in Alzheimer’s disease. Karuna Therapeutics was acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb in March 2024.\n• In January 2023, we acquired royalty interests in Spinraza and pelacarsen from Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for an upfront payment of $500 million\nand committed up to $625 million in additional payments contingent upon the achievement of certain pelacarsen milestones. Spinraza is approved\nfor the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy and pelacarsen is in Phase 3 development by Novartis for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. For the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, we generated $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion,\nrespectively, in Net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that our existing capital resources, cash provided by operating activities and access to our\nRevolving Credit Facility (defined below) will continue to allow us to meet our operating and working capital requirements, to fund planned strategic\nacquisitions and R&D funding arrangements, and to meet our debt service obligations for the foreseeable future. We have historically operated at a low level of\nfixed operating costs. Our primary cash operating expenses, other than R&D funding commitments, include interest expense, Operating and Personnel\nPayments and legal and professional fees.\n42\nWe have access to substantial sources of funds in the capital markets and we may, from time to time, seek additional capital through a combination of\nadditional debt or equity financings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the par value of all of our outstanding senior unsecured notes was\n$7.8 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively. Additionally, we have up to $1.8 billion of available revolving commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility. A\nsummary of our borrowing activities, balances and compliance with certain debt covenants under various financing arrangements is included in Note 9–\nBorrowings of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe have historically funded our investments through operating cash flows, equity contributions and debt. Our low operating costs coupled with a lack of\ncapital expenditures and low taxes have contributed to our strong financial profile, resulting in high operating leverage and high cash flow conversion. We\nexpect to continue funding our current and planned operating costs (excluding acquisitions) principally through our cash flow from operations and investments\nthrough cash flow and issuances of equity and debt. We have supplemented our available cash and cash equivalents on hand with attractive debt capital to fund\ncertain strategic acquisitions.\nOur ability to satisfy our working capital needs, debt service and other obligations, and to comply with the financial covenants under our financing\nagreements depends on our future operating performance and cash flow, which are in turn subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control.\nCash Flows\nThe following table and analysis of cash flow changes presents a summary of our cash flow activities (in thousands):\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\nCash provided by/(used in):\nOperating activities $ 2,026,461 $ 2,215,174 $ (188,713)\nInvesting activities (2,172,527) (1,072,617) (1,099,910)\nFinancing activities 619,108 (1,916,860) 2,535,968\nAnalysis of Cash Flow Changes\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities decreased by $188.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily\ndue to a decrease in cash collections from financial royalty assets of $248.1 million. In the first quarter of 2023, cash collections from financial royalty assets\nincluded a $475.0 million milestone payment related to Zavzpret . The decrease was partially offset by lower development-stage funding payments and lower\npayments for operating and professional costs in the first nine months of 2024.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities increased by $1.1 billion in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven\nby higher use of cash for purchases of financial royalty assets, available for sale debt securities and equity securities. The higher use of cash was partially offset\nby proceeds from equity securities.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 2024 was $619.1 million as compared to cash used in financing activities of $1.9 billion\nin the first nine months of 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by the net proceeds of $1.5 billion\nfrom issuance of the 2024 Notes (as further described below). In the first nine months of 2023, cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by $1.0\nbillion in debt repayment.\n43\nSources of Capital\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 our cash and cash equivalents totaled $950.1 million and $477.0 million, respectively. We intend to\nfund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash and cash equivalents, future cash flows from operations or the issuance of\nadditional debt. Our ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely\naffected if there is a material decline in the sales of the underlying pharmaceutical products in which we hold royalties, deterioration in our key financial ratios\nor credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. Currently, we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt,\nenter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support our growth objectives.\nBorrowings\nOur borrowings consisted of the following (in thousands):\nType of Borrowing Date of Issuance Maturity As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nSenior Unsecured Notes:\n$1,000,000, 1.20% (issued at 98.875% of par) 9/2020 9/2025 1,000,000 1,000,000\n$1,000,000, 1.75% (issued at 98.284% of par) 9/2020 9/2027 1,000,000 1,000,000\n$500,000, 5.15% (issued at 98.758% of par) 6/2024 9/2029 500,000 —\n$1,000,000, 2.20% (issued at 97.760% of par) 9/2020 9/2030 1,000,000 1,000,000\n$600,000, 2.15% (issued at 98.263% of par) 7/2021 9/2031 600,000 600,000\n$500,000, 5.40% (issued at 97.872% of par) 6/2024 9/2034 500,000 —\n$1,000,000, 3.30% (issued at 95.556% of par) 9/2020 9/2040 1,000,000 1,000,000\n$1,000,000, 3.55% (issued at 95.306% of par) 9/2020 9/2050 1,000,000 1,000,000\n$700,000, 3.35% (issued at 97.565% of par) 7/2021 9/2051 700,000 700,000\n$500,000, 5.90% (issued at 97.617% of par) 6/2024 9/2054 500,000 —\nTotal senior unsecured debt 7,800,000 6,300,000\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs (192,621) (164,715)\nTotal debt carrying value 7,607,379 6,135,285\nLess: Current portion of long-term debt (996,942) —\nTotal long-term debt $ 6,610,437 $ 6,135,285\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nIn June 2024, we issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes (the “2024 Notes”) with a weighted average coupon rate 5.48%. In July 2021, we issued\n$1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes (the “2021 Notes”) with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.80%. In September 2020, we issued $6.0 billion of senior\nunsecured notes (the “2020 Notes”) with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.13%. We refer to the 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes and 2024 Notes, collectively, as the\n“Notes.” The Notes require semi-annual interest payments. The first interest payment date for the 2024 Notes will be March 2, 2025. Indentures governing the\nNotes contain certain covenants with which we were in compliance as of September 30, 2024.\n44\nSenior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nOur subsidiary, RP Holdings, as borrower, initially entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) on September 15,\n2021, which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement, which was\nentered into on December 22, 2023, increased the borrowing capacity to $1.8 billion for general corporate purposes with $1.69 billion of the revolving\ncommitments maturing on December 22, 2028 and the remaining $110.0 million of revolving commitments maturing on October 31, 2027. On January 24,\n2024, we entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Credit Agreement to make certain technical modifications. As of September 30, 2024, we have a borrowing\ncapacity of $1.8 billion under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Agreement that governs the Revolving Credit Facility contains certain customary covenants, that among other things, require us to maintain (i)\na consolidated leverage ratio at or below 4.00 to 1.00 (or at or below 4.50 to 1.00 following a qualifying material acquisition) of consolidated funded debt to\nAdjusted EBITDA, each as defined and calculated as set forth in the Credit Agreement, (ii) a consolidated coverage ratio at or above 2.50 to 1.00 of Adjusted\nEBITDA to consolidated interest expense, each as defined and calculated as set forth in the Credit Agreement and (iii) a consolidated Portfolio Cash Flow\nRatio at or below 5.00 to 1.00 (or at or below 5.50 to 1.00 following a qualifying material acquisition) of consolidated funded debt to Portfolio Cash Flow, each\nas defined and calculated as set forth in the Credit Agreement.\nWe were in compliance with the financial covenants as of September 30, 2024.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are non-GAAP liquidity measures that are key components of certain material covenants contained within the\nCredit Agreement. Noncompliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement could result in our lenders requiring us to immediately repay all\namounts borrowed. If we cannot satisfy these financial covenants, we would be prohibited under our Credit Agreement from engaging in certain activities, such\nas incurring additional indebtedness, paying dividends, making certain payments and acquiring and disposing of assets.\nThe table below presents Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow, each as calculated according to its respective definition in our Credit Agreement (in\nthousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nPortfolio Receipts $ 734,624 $ 637,160 $ 2,059,602 $ 2,312,807\nPayments for operating and professional costs (55,232) (54,961) (163,804) (188,839)\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 679,392 $ 582,199 $ 1,895,798 $ 2,123,968\nInterest paid, net (62,464) (53,967) (121,318) (102,706)\nPortfolio Cash Flow (non-GAAP) $ 616,928 $ 528,232 $ 1,774,480 $ 2,021,262\n45\nAdjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are non-GAAP liquidity measures that exclude the impact of certain items and therefore have not been\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP.

A royalty is the\ncontractual right to a percentage of top-line sales from a licensee’s use of a product, technology or intellectual property. The majority of our current\nportfolio consists of third-party royalties.\n• Synthetic Royalties – Newly-created royalties on approved or late-stage development therapies with strong proof of concept and high commercial\npotential. A synthetic royalty is the contractual right to a percentage of top-line sales by the developer or marketer of a therapy in exchange for\nfunding. A synthetic royalty may also include contingent milestone payments. We also fund ongoing R&D for biopharmaceutical companies in\nexchange for future royalties and milestones if the product or indication we are funding is approved.\n• Launch and Development Capital – Tailored supplemental funding solutions, generally included as a component within a transaction, increase the\nscale of our capital. Launch and development capital is generally provided in exchange for a long-term stream of fixed payments with a\npredetermined schedule around the launch of a drug. Launch and development capital may also include a direct investment in the public equity of a\ncompany.\n46\n• Mergers and Acquisitions (“M&A”) Related – We acquire royalties in connection with M&A transactions, often from the buyers of\nbiopharmaceutical companies when they dispose of the non-strategic assets of the target company following the closing of the acquisition. We also\nseek to partner with companies to acquire other biopharmaceutical companies that own significant royalties. We may also seek to acquire\nbiopharmaceutical companies that have significant royalties or where we can create royalties in subsequent transactions.\nAdditionally, we may identify additional opportunities, platforms or technologies that leverage our capabilities.\nDistributions to Shareholders\nWe paid dividends to holders of our Class A ordinary shares of $282.8 million and $269.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe do not have a legal obligation to pay a quarterly dividend or dividends at any specified rate or at all.\nClass A Ordinary Share Repurchases\nIn March 2023, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our Class A ordinary\nshares. The authorization for the share repurchase program expires on June 23, 2027. Share repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately\nnegotiated transactions. In the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased 6.6 million shares at a cost of approximately $179.7 million. In the first nine months\nof 2023, we repurchased 8.9 million shares at a cost of approximately $278.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $515.6 million remained\navailable under the share repurchase program.\nOther Funding Arrangements\nAs part of the expanded funding collaboration we entered into with Cytokinetics in May 2024, we agreed to fund the clinical trial for CK-586. We funded\n$50 million upfront in May 2024. We have an option to fund up to an additional $150 million which we have not exercised as of September 30, 2024.\nWe have a long-term funding arrangement with Cytokinetics which is comprised of seven tranches of up to $525 million in total funding (“Cytokinetics\nCommercial Launch Funding”). As of September 30, 2024, $350 million remained available under Cytokinetics Commercial Launch Funding of which\nCytokinetics is required to draw a minimum of $50 million.\nIn November 2023, we entered into a funding agreement with Teva to provide up to $100 million to fund the ongoing development of olanzapine LAI\n(TEV-’749). As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded commitments of $18 million related to the agreement with Teva.\nWe may have other funding arrangements where we are contractually obligated to fund R&D activities performed by our development partners. We also\nhave funding arrangements related to our equity method investments in the Avillion Entities. As our committed capital requirements are based on phases of\ndevelopment, the completion of which is highly uncertain, only the capital required to fund the current stage of development under such funding arrangements\nis considered committed capital, which was approximately $18.3 million as of September 30, 2024.\nWe also have certain milestones payable to our counterparties that are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory\napproval or commercial milestones. These contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations. In the first nine months of 2024, we paid\na $50.0 million regulatory milestone related to olpasiran. In the first nine months of 2023, we paid a $12.4 million sales-based milestone related to Erleada and\na $50.0 million clinical milestone payment to Cytokinetics for aficamten.\n47\nDebt Service\nAs of September 30, 2024, the future principal and interest payments under our Notes over the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Principal Payments Interest Payments\nRemainder of 2024 $ — $ —\n2025 1,000,000 257,792\n2026 — 226,600\n2027 1,000,000 226,600\n2028 — 209,100\nThereafter 5,800,000 2,753,800\nTotal(1) $ 7,800,000 $ 3,673,892\n(1) Excludes unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $192.6 million as of September 30, 2024, which are amortized through interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt\nobligations.\nOperating and Personnel Payments\nUnder the Management Agreement, we pay quarterly Operating and Personnel Payments equal to 6.5% of the cash receipts from Royalty Investments, or\nPortfolio Receipts, for such quarter and 0.25% of our security investments under GAAP as of the end of each quarter. Because the Operating and Personnel\nPayments are determined based on Portfolio Receipts, the amounts are variable. The payment for our Operating and Personnel Payment is the most significant\ncomponent of Payments for operating and professional costs presented on the statements of cash flows. Additionally, the expenses incurred in respect of\nOperating and Personnel Payments are expected to comprise the most significant component of G&A expenses on an ongoing basis.\nGuarantor Financial Information\nOur obligations under the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by RP Holdings, a non-wholly owned subsidiary (the “Guarantor Subsidiary”).\nOur remaining subsidiaries (the “Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries”) do not guarantee the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, Royalty\nPharma plc and the Guarantor Subsidiary each fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee the payment of interest, principal and premium, if any,\non the Notes. As of September 30, 2024, the par value and carrying value of the total outstanding and guaranteed Notes was $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion,\nrespectively.\n48\nThe following financial information presents summarized combined balance sheet information as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and\nsummarized combined statement of operations information for the first nine months of 2024 for Royalty Pharma plc and RP Holdings. All intercompany\nbalances and transactions between Royalty Pharma plc and RP Holdings are eliminated in the presentation of the combined financial statements. RP Holdings’\nmost significant asset is its investment in operating subsidiaries, which has been eliminated in the table below to exclude investments in Non-Guarantor\nSubsidiaries. Our operating subsidiaries hold the majority of our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and financial royalty assets. As a result, our\nability to make required payments on the Notes depends on the performance of our operating subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us. There are\nno material restrictions on distributions from the operating subsidiaries. Amounts presented below do not represent our total consolidated amounts (in\nthousands):\nSummarized Combined Balance Sheets\nAs of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nCurrent assets $ 4,443 $ 42,474\nCurrent interest receivable on intercompany notes due from Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries 42,109 13,086\nCurrent intercompany notes receivable due from Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries 243,741 —\nNon-current assets 3,329 4,107\nNon-current intercompany notes receivable due from Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries 2,027,596 1,921,576\nCurrent liabilities 1,042,689 53,390\nCurrent interest payable on intercompany notes due to Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries 9,374 13,086\nCurrent intercompany notes payable due to Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries 243,741 —\nNon-current liabilities 6,607,306 6,134,383\nNon-current intercompany notes payable due to Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries 1,618,553 1,550,204\nSummarized Combined Statement of Operations For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nInterest income on intercompany notes receivable due from Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries $ 70,880\nOther income 762\nOperating expenses 173,926\nInterest expense on intercompany notes due to Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries 38,145\nNet loss 140,429\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates,\njudgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Certain of these\npolicies are considered critical as they have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult,\nsubjective, or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. On an ongoing basis,\nwe evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of income and\nexpenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could\ndiffer from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur most critical accounting policies relate to our financial royalty assets. Similarly, the most significant judgments and estimates applied by management\nare associated with the measurement of our financial royalty assets at amortized cost using the prospective effective interest method. The application of the\nprospective approach to calculate interest income from our financial royalty assets requires management’s judgment in forecasting the expected future cash\nflows of the underlying royalties. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as described in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\n49\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThere have been no material changes in market risk exposures that affect the disclosures presented in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures\nabout Market Risk” in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) prior to the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and operation, effective to the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of\nthe Exchange Act during the third quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any,\nwithin a company have been detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of our disclosure control system are met and, as set forth above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on\ntheir evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance\nthat the objectives of our disclosure control system were met.\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFor a description of our legal proceedings, refer to Note 13–Commitments and Contingencies, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n50\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nDescribed below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business. You should carefully consider the following information about these risks,\ntogether with the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. Additional risks and uncertainties not\npresently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. These\nrisks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\nRisks Relating to Our Business\n• risks related to sales of biopharmaceutical products on which we receive royalties;\n• the growth of the royalty market;\n• the ability of the Manager to identify suitable assets for us to acquire;\n• uncertainties related to the acquisition of interests in development-stage biopharmaceutical product candidates and our strategy to add development-\nstage product candidates to our product portfolio;\n• potential strategic acquisitions of biopharmaceutical companies;\n• our use of leverage in connection with our capital deployment;\n• our ability to leverage our competitive strengths;\n• marketers of products that generate our royalties are outside of our control and are responsible for development, pursuit of ongoing regulatory\napproval, commercialization, manufacturing and marketing;\n• governmental regulation of the biopharmaceutical industry;\n• interest rate risk, foreign exchange fluctuations and inflation;\n• our reliance on the Manager for all services we require and key members of the Manager’s senior advisory team;\n• actual and potential conflicts of interest with the Manager and its affiliates;\n• the ability of the Manager or its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals;\n• the assumptions underlying our business model;\n• our reliance on a limited number of products;\n• the competitive nature of the biopharmaceutical industry;\nRisks Relating to Our Organization and Structure\n• our organizational structure, including our status as a holding company;\nRisks Relating to Our Class A Ordinary Shares\n• volatility of the market price of our Class A ordinary shares;\n• our incorporation under English law;\nRisks Relating to Taxation\n• the effect of changes to tax legislation and our tax position;\n51\nGeneral Risk Factors\n• cyber-attacks or other failures in telecommunications or information technology systems; and\n• the future outbreak of any infectious or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19 on our operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nBiopharmaceutical products are subject to sales risks.\nBiopharmaceutical product sales may be lower than expected due to a number of reasons, including pricing pressures, insufficient demand, product\ncompetition, failure of clinical trials, lack of market acceptance, changes in the marketer’s strategic priorities, obsolescence, lack of acceptance by government\nhealthcare programs or private insurance plans, loss of patent protection, government regulations or other factors, and development-stage product candidates\nmay fail to reach the market. Unexpected side effects, safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to a product, leading to product recalls, withdrawals,\ndeclining sales or litigation. As a result, payments of our royalties may be reduced or ceased. In addition, these payments may be delayed, causing our near-\nterm financial performance to be weaker than expected.\nThe royalty market may not grow at the same rate as it has in the past, or at all, and we may not be able to acquire sufficient royalties to sustain the\ngrowth of our business.\nWe have been able to grow our business over time by primarily acquiring royalties. However, we may not be able to identify and acquire a sufficient\nnumber of royalties, or royalties of sufficient scale, to invest the full amount of capital that may be available to us in the future, or at our targeted amount and\nrate of deployment, which could prevent us from executing our growth strategy and negatively impact our business. Changes in the royalty market, including\nits structure, participants and growth rate, changes in preferred methods of financing and capital raising in the biopharmaceutical industry, or a reduction in the\ngrowth of the biopharmaceutical industry, could lead to diminished opportunities for us to acquire royalties, fewer royalties (or fewer royalties of significant\nscale) being available, or increased competition for royalties. Even if we continue to acquire royalties, they generally will not generate a meaningful return for\na period of several years, if at all, due to transaction structures, circumstances relating to the underlying products or other factors. As a result, we may not be\nable to continue to acquire royalties or otherwise grow our business as we have in the past, or at all.\nAcquisitions of royalties from our investments in development-stage biopharmaceutical product candidates are subject to additional risks and\nuncertainties.\nWe may acquire more royalties on development-stage product candidates that have not yet received marketing approval by any regulatory authority or\nbeen commercialized. There can be no assurance that the FDA, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), the European\nMedicines Agency (“EMA”), Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) or other regulatory authorities will approve such products or that such\nproducts will be brought to market timely or at all, or that the market will be receptive to such products. We have previously acquired royalties on\ndevelopment-stage product candidates for which clinical development was stopped for a number of reasons, including clinical trials failing to meet their\nprimary endpoints. These failures have resulted in, and future failures could lead to, non-cash impairment charges or other investment write downs.\nIf the FDA, MHRA, the EMA, PMDA or other regulatory authority approves a development-stage product candidate that generates our royalties, the\nlabeling, packaging, manufacturing, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and\nongoing regulatory requirements. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, including adverse events of unanticipated\nseverity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the product and could include withdrawal of the product from the market.\nIn addition, the developers of these development-stage product candidates may not be able to raise additional capital to continue their discovery,\ndevelopment and commercialization activities, which may cause them to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of their clinical trials or R&D\nprograms. If other product developers introduce and market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive than the products that generate our\nroyalties, or if such developers introduce their products prior to the competing products underlying our royalties, the products in which we have invested may\nnot achieve commercial success and thereby result in diminished returns or reduced royalties for us, adversely affecting our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations.\n52\nFurther, the developers of such products may not have sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. If no sales, marketing or distribution arrangements can\nbe made on acceptable terms or at all, the affected product may not be able to be successfully commercialized, which will result in a loss for us. Losses from\nsuch assets could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe intend to continue to provide capital to innovators to co-fund clinical development of a product candidate in exchange for a share of the future\nrevenues of that asset and when we do so, we do not control its clinical development. In these situations, the innovators may not complete activities on\nschedule or in accordance with our expectations or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which could delay or prevent the development,\napproval, manufacturing or commercialization of the development-stage product candidate for which we have provided funding.\nUncertainty relating to development-stage product candidates makes it more difficult to develop accurate assumptions for our internal models, which can\nresult in reduced royalties compared to estimates. There can be no assurance that our assumptions around the likelihood of a development-stage product\ncandidate’s approval or achieving significant sales will prove correct, that regulatory authorities will approve such development-stage product candidates, that\nsuch development-stage product candidates will be brought to market timely or at all, or that such products will achieve commercial success or result in\nroyalties consistent with our estimates.\nWe may undertake strategic acquisitions of biopharmaceutical companies or acquire securities of biopharmaceutical companies. Our failure to realize\nexpected benefits of such acquisitions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may acquire companies with significant royalty assets or where we believe we could create significant synthetic royalties. These acquired or created\nroyalty assets may not perform as we project. Moreover, the acquisition of operating biopharmaceutical companies will result in the assumption of, or exposure\nto, liabilities of the acquired business that are not inherent in our other royalty acquisitions, such as direct exposure to product liability claims, high fixed costs\nor an expansion of our operations and expense structure, thereby potentially decreasing our profitability. The diversion of our management’s attention and any\ndelay or difficulties encountered in connection with any future acquisitions we may consummate could result in the disruption of our on-going business\noperations. Despite our business, financial and legal due diligence efforts, we have limited experience in assessing acquisition opportunities, and we ultimately\nmay be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all risks associated with such acquisitions. Moreover, we may need to raise additional funds through public\nor private debt or equity financing to acquire any businesses or products, which may result in dilution for shareholders or the incurrence of indebtedness. As a\nresult, our acquisition of biopharmaceutical companies could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may seek to expand our market opportunity by acquiring securities issued by biopharmaceutical companies. Where we acquire equity securities as all\nor part of the consideration for business development activities, the value of those securities will fluctuate, and may depreciate. We will likely not control the\ncompanies in which we acquire securities, and as a result, we may have limited ability to determine management, operational decisions or policies. Further,\nsuch transactions may face risks and liabilities that due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not disclosed to us, or that we inadequately assess. In addition,\nas a result of our activities, we may receive material non-public information about other companies. Where such information relates to a company whose equity\nsecurities we hold, we may be delayed or prevented from selling such securities when we would otherwise choose to do so, and such delay or prohibition may\nresult in a loss or reduced gain on such securities.\n53\nWe use leverage in connection with our capital deployment, which magnifies the potential for loss if the royalties acquired do not generate sufficient\nincome to us.\nWe use borrowed funds to finance a significant portion of our deployed capital. The use of leverage creates an opportunity for an increased return but also\nincreases the risk of loss if our assets do not generate sufficient cash flows to us. The interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such\nborrowings may not be covered by our cash flow. In addition, leverage may inhibit our operating flexibility and reduce cash flow available for dividends or to\nmake share repurchases.\nThe level of our indebtedness could limit our ability to respond to changing business conditions. The various agreements relating to our borrowings may\nimpose operating and financial restrictions on us which could affect the number and size of the royalties that we may pursue. Therefore, no assurance can be\ngiven that we will be able to take advantage of favorable conditions or opportunities as a result of any restrictive covenants under our indebtedness. There can\nalso be no assurance that additional debt financing, either to replace or increase existing debt financing, will be available when needed or, if available, will be\nobtainable on terms that are commercially reasonable.\nAdditional risks related to our leverage include:\n• to the extent that interest rates at which we borrow increase, our borrowing costs will increase and our leveraging strategy will become more costly,\nwhich could lead to diminished net profits;\n• we have to comply with various financial covenants in the agreements that govern our debt, including requirements to maintain certain leverage ratios\nand coverage ratios, which may affect our ability to achieve our business objectives;\n• our ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases may be restricted;\n• our royalties may be used as collateral for our borrowings; and\n• in the event of a default under secured borrowings, if any, one or more of our creditors or their assignees could obtain control of our royalties and, in\nthe event of a distressed sale, these creditors could dispose of these royalties for significantly less value than we could realize for them.\nWe do not employ our own personnel and are entirely dependent upon the Manager for all the services we require.\nBecause we are “externally managed,” we do not employ our own personnel, but instead depend upon the Manager, its executive officers and its\nemployees for all of the services we require. The Manager selects and manages the acquisition of royalties, milestones and other contractual receipts and\nrelated assets that meet our investment criteria and provides all our other administrative services. Accordingly, our success is dependent upon the expertise and\nservices of the executive officers and employees of the Manager. The Management Agreement has an initial term of ten years, after which it can be renewed for\nan additional term of three years, unless either we or the Manager provide notice of non-renewal 180 days prior the expiration of the initial term or renewal\nterm. The Manager may not be removed during the initial or any renewal term without cause. While our Management Agreement requires its executives to\ndevote substantially all their time to managing us and any legacy vehicles related to RPI 2019 ICAV or Old RPI unless otherwise approved by the board of\ndirectors, such resources may prove to be inadequate to meet our needs.\n54\nThe success of our business depends upon key members of the Manager’s advisory team who may not continue to work for the Manager.\nWe depend on the expertise, skill and network of business contacts of the key members of the Manager’s advisory team, who evaluate, negotiate,\nstructure, execute, monitor and service our assets. Our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service and coordination of the advisory\nteam of the Manager, particularly Mr. Legorreta. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, executives of the Manager must devote substantially all of their\nbusiness time to managing us, unless otherwise approved by the board of directors. Despite this, Mr. Legorreta and other key members of the Manager’s\nadvisory team may have other demands on their time, and we cannot assure you that they will continue to be actively involved in our business. Each of these\nindividuals is an employee of the Manager and is not subject to an employment contract with us, which means we do not direct the composition of the\nManger’s advisory team as well as the compensation or professional development of these individuals. The departure of any of these individuals or competing\ndemands on their time could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe key advisory professionals of the Manager have relationships with participants in the biopharmaceutical industry, financial institutions and other\nadvisory professionals, which we rely upon to source potential asset acquisition opportunities. If the key advisory professionals of the Manager fail to maintain\nsuch relationships, or to develop new relationships with other sources, we may not be able to grow our portfolio. In addition, we can offer no assurance that\nthese relationships, even if maintained, will generate royalty acquisition opportunities for us in the future.\nThere can be no assurance that the policies and procedures we have established to mitigate conflicts of interest will be effective in doing so.\nThe Manager cannot manage another entity that invests in or acquires royalties other than any legacy vehicle related to RPI 2019 ICAV or Old RPI. Every\nsenior executive of the Manager is subject to a non-compete agreement that is effective for 18 months following termination of their employment for any\nreason. We are a beneficiary of these agreements. In addition, executives of the Manager must devote substantially all of their time to managing us and any\nlegacy vehicle related to RPI 2019 ICAV or Old RPI, unless otherwise approved by the board of directors. Despite this, the ability of the Manager and its\nofficers and employees to engage in other business activities, subject to the terms of our Management Agreement, may reduce the amount of time the Manager,\nits officers or other employees spend managing us.\nThere could be conflicts of interest between us and our advisory personnel. For instance, Mr. Legorreta, our Chief Executive Officer, is also a co-founder\nof and has significant influence over Pharmakon Advisors, which shares physical premises with the Manager. Pharmakon manages BioPharma Credit PLC\n(LSE: BPCR) and other investment vehicles that collectively are leading providers of debt capital to the biopharmaceutical industry. Mr. Legorreta has a\nsubstantial investment in BioPharma Credit. In addition, Mr. Legorreta serves as the chairperson of the board of directors of ProKidney Corp. and he has\nfounded and participates in foundations that receive and provide medical research funding. Even though he is involved with Pharmakon, BioPharma Credit\nPLC, ProKidney Corp. and the foundations described above, among other organizations, Mr. Legorreta does not have any material constraints on the time he\nhas available to devote to the Manager and thereby to us. While the Manager and Pharmakon may pursue similar investment opportunities, we believe that\nactual conflicts of interest are rare due to differing investment strategies, and the fact that royalty holders determine the type of transaction they seek. Under\narrangements with Pharmakon, the Manager subleases office space to Pharmakon, and the parties may provide research, business development, legal,\ncompliance, financial and administrative services to one another. The Manager and Pharmakon reimburse each other to the extent that one of them provides\nmaterially more services to the other than they receive in return. In addition, certain employees of the Manager may receive compensation from Pharmakon.\nThe Manager’s compensation arrangements may have unintended consequences. We have agreed to pay the Manager or its affiliates quarterly operating\nand personnel expenses (the “Operating and Personnel Payments”), based on Portfolio Receipts and the mark-to-market value of security investments at the\nend of each quarter regardless of whether we realize any gain on our investments. Consequently, the Manager may be incentivized to have us make investments\nregardless of our expected gain on such investments, which may not align with our or our shareholders’ interests.\n55\nTo service our indebtedness and meet our other ongoing liquidity needs, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash\ndepends on many factors beyond our control. If we cannot generate the required cash, we may not be able to make the required payments under our\nindebtedness.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our total principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding was $7.8 billion. In addition, we have up to $1.8 billion of\navailable revolving commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). Except for RP Holdings, our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the\nsenior unsecured notes will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the senior unsecured notes or to make any funds available to\npay those amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payment. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from\noperations to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nAbsent sufficient cash flow and the ability to refinance, we could also be forced to sell assets to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations.\nHowever, the terms of the agreements that govern our existing outstanding debt limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of\nproceeds from such a sale. Accordingly, we may not be able to sell assets quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our obligations on our\nindebtedness.\nOur business is subject to interest rate, foreign exchange, inflation and banking industry risk.\nWe are subject to interest rate fluctuation exposure through any borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and our investments in money market\naccounts and marketable securities, the majority of which bear a variable interest rate. In addition, the discontinuation, modification or other reform of any\nreference rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), could create uncertainty, require us to amend certain agreements or increase our\ninterest expense. To the extent that interest rates generally increase, our borrowing costs may increase and our leverage strategy will become more costly,\nleading to diminished net profits.\nCertain products pay royalties in currencies other than U.S. dollars, which creates foreign currency risk primarily with respect to the Euro, Canadian\ndollar, British pound, Swiss franc and Japanese yen, as our functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. In addition, our results of operations are subject\nto foreign currency exchange risk through transactional exposure resulting from movements in exchange rates between the time we recognize royalty income\nor royalty revenue and the time at which the transaction settles, or we receive the royalty payment. Because we are entitled to royalties on worldwide sales for\nvarious products, there is an underlying exposure to foreign currency as the marketer converts payment amounts from local currencies to U.S. dollars using a\nquarterly average exchange rate. Therefore, cash received may differ from the estimated receivable based on fluctuations in currency.\nWe are also subject to risks and uncertainties caused by significant events with macroeconomic impacts, including, but not limited to geopolitical events,\nincluding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, conflicts in the Middle East, rising inflation and interest rates, monetary policy changes, financial services sector\ninstability, recessions, global pandemics and foreign currency fluctuations. Changes in the value of currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, or high inflation in\ncountries using a currency other than the U.S. dollar, can impact our revenues, costs and expenses and our financial guidance.\nOther events that affect the banking industry may adversely affect the banking institutions that hold our cash. Our primary operating accounts\nsignificantly exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. In the event of a bank insolvency or failure, we may be considered a general creditor of\nthe bank, and we might lose some or all of the cash deposited with the bank. Even where it is recognized that a bank might be in danger of insolvency or\nfailure, we might not be able to withdraw or transfer our cash from the bank in time to avoid any adverse effects of the insolvency or failure.\n56\nInformation about the biopharmaceutical products underlying the royalties we buy available to us may be limited and therefore our ability to analyze\neach product and its potential future cash flow may be similarly limited.\nWe may have limited information concerning the products generating the royalties we are evaluating for acquisition. Often, the information we have\nregarding products following our acquisition of a royalty may be limited to the information that is available in the public domain. Therefore, there may be\nmaterial information that relates to such products that we would like to know but do not have and may not be able to obtain. For example, we do not always\nknow the results of studies conducted by marketers of the products or others or the nature or amount of any complaints from doctors or users of such products.\nIn addition, the market data that we obtain independently may also prove to be incomplete or incorrect. Due to these and other factors, the actual cash flow\nfrom a royalty may be significantly lower than our estimates.\nOur future income is dependent upon numerous royalty-specific assumptions and, if these assumptions prove not to be accurate, we may not achieve\nour expected rates of returns.\nOur business model is based on multiple-year internal and external forecasts regarding product sales and numerous product-specific assumptions in\nconnection with each royalty acquisition, including where we have limited information regarding the product. There can be no assurance that the assumptions\nunderlying our financial models, including those regarding product sales or competition, patent expirations, exclusivity terms, license terms or license\nterminations for the products underlying our portfolio, are accurate. These assumptions involve a significant element of subjective judgment and may be, and in\nthe past have been, adversely affected by post-acquisition changes in market conditions and other factors affecting the underlying product. The risks relating to\nthese assumptions may be exacerbated for development-stage product candidates due to the uncertainties around their development, labeling, regulatory\napproval, commercialization timing, manufacturing and supply, competing products or related factors. Our assumptions regarding the financial stability or\noperational or marketing capabilities of the partner obligated to pay us royalties may also prove, and in the past have proven, to be incorrect. Due to these and\nother factors, the assets in our current portfolio or future assets may not generate expected returns or returns in line with our historical financial performance or\nin the time periods we expect or at all, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nWe make assumptions regarding the royalty duration for terms that are not contractually fixed, and a shortened royalty term could result in a reduction\nin the effective interest rate, a decline in income from royalties, significant reductions in royalty payments compared to expectations, or a permanent\nimpairment.\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we classify most royalty assets that we acquire as financial\nassets that are measured at amortized cost using the prospective effective interest method described in ASC 835-30. The effective interest rate is calculated by\nforecasting the expected cash flows to be received over the life of the asset relative to the initial invested amount, net of any purchased receivables. A critical\ncomponent of such forecast is our assumptions regarding duration of the royalty.\nThe royalty duration is important for purposes of accurately measuring interest income over the life of a royalty. In making assumptions around the\nroyalty duration for terms that are not contractually fixed, we consider the strength of existing patent protection, expected entry of generics, geographical\nexclusivity periods and potential patent term extensions tied to the underlying product.\nThe duration of a royalty usually varies on a country-by-country basis and can be based on a number of factors, such as patent expiration dates, whether\nthe product is sold singly or in combination, regulatory exclusivity, years from first commercial sale of the patent-protected product, the entry of competing\ngeneric or biosimilar products, or other terms set out in the contracts governing the royalty. It is common for royalty durations to expire earlier or later than\nanticipated due to unforeseen positive or negative developments over time, including with respect to the granting of patents and patent term extensions, the\ninvalidation of patents, claims of patent misuse, litigation between the party controlling the patents and third party challengers of the patents, the ability of third\nparties to design around or circumvent valid patents, the granting of regulatory exclusivity periods or extensions, timing for the arrival of generic or biosimilar\ncompetitor products, changes to legal or regulatory regimes affecting intellectual property rights or the regulation of pharmaceutical products, product life\ncycles, and industry consolidations.\n57\nIf an unexpected shortening of a royalty term were to occur, it could result in a reduction in the effective interest rate for the asset, a decline in income\nfrom royalties, and a significant reduction in royalty payments compared to expectations, or a permanent impairment.\nMost of our royalties are classified as financial assets that are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method as a result of which our\nGAAP results of operations can be volatile and unpredictable.\nIn accordance with GAAP, most of the royalty assets we acquire are treated as investments in cash flow streams and are thus classified as financial assets.\nUnder this classification, our financial royalty assets are treated as having a yield component that resembles loans measured at amortized cost under the\neffective interest accounting methodology. Under this accounting methodology, we calculate the effective interest rate on each financial royalty asset using a\nforecast of the expected cash flows to be received over the life of the financial royalty asset relative to the initial acquisition price. The yield, which is\ncalculated at the end of each reporting period and applied prospectively, is then recognized via accretion into our income at the effective rate of return over the\nexpected life of the financial royalty asset.\nAs a result of the non-cash charges associated with the application of the effective interest method accounting methodology, our income statement activity\nin respect of many of our royalties can be volatile and unpredictable. Small declines in sell-side equity research analysts’ consensus sales forecasts over a long\ntime horizon can result in an immediate non-cash income statement expense recognition, even though the applicable cash inflows will not be realized for many\nyears into the future. For example, in late 2014 we acquired the cystic fibrosis franchise, which is classified as a financial royalty asset. Beginning in the second\nquarter of 2015, declines in near-term sales forecasts of sell-side equity research analysts caused us to recognize non-cash provision expenses to the income\nstatement and build up a corresponding cumulative allowance which reduced the gross balance for this financial royalty asset. Over the course of 10 quarters,\nwe recognized non-cash provision expenses as a result of these changes in forecasts, including a non-cash expense of $743.2 million in 2016, ultimately\nreaching a peak cumulative allowance of $1.30 billion by September 30, 2017 related to this financial royalty asset. With the approval of the Vertex triple\ncombination therapy, Trikafta, in October 2019, sell-side equity research analysts’ consensus sales forecasts increased to reflect the larger addressable market\nand the extension of the expected duration of the Trikafta royalty. While small reductions in the cumulative allowance for the cystic fibrosis franchise were\nrecognized as provision income in 2017 and 2018, there remained a $1.10 billion cumulative allowance that was fully reduced by recognizing non-cash\nprovision income of $1.10 billion in 2019 as a result of an increase in sell-side equity research analysts’ consensus sales forecasts associated with the Trikafta\napproval. The financial statement impact caused by the application of the effective interest accounting methodology could result in a negative perception of our\nresults in a given period.\nOur reliance on a limited number of products may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWhile our current asset portfolio includes royalties relating to over 35 marketed products, the top five product franchises accounted for 64% of our\nRoyalty Receipts in the first nine months of 2024. In addition, our asset portfolio may not be fully diversified by geographic region or other criteria. Any\nsignificant deterioration in the cash flows from the top products in our asset portfolio could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of\noperations.\nWe face competition in acquiring royalties and locating suitable royalties to acquire.\nThere are a limited number of suitable and attractive opportunities to acquire high-quality royalties. Therefore, competition to acquire such royalties is\nintense and may increase. We compete with other potential acquirers for these opportunities, including companies that market the products on which royalties\nare paid, investment vehicles and other pools of capital, financial institutions, institutional investors (including sovereign wealth and pension funds) and others.\nThese competitors may be able to access lower cost capital, may be larger than us, may have relationships that provide them access to opportunities before us,\nor may be willing to acquire royalties for lower projected returns than we are.\n58\nBiopharmaceutical products are subject to substantial competition.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive and rapidly evolving industry. The length of any product’s commercial life cannot be predicted\nwith certainty. One or more products on which we are entitled to a royalty may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive by new or alternate products or\nimprovements made to existing products on which we are not entitled to a royalty, either by the current marketer of such products or by another marketer.\nCurrent marketers of products may undertake these development efforts in order to improve their products or to avoid paying our royalty. Adverse competition,\nobsolescence or governmental and regulatory action or healthcare policy changes could significantly affect the revenues, including royalty-related revenues, of\nthe products which generate our royalties.\nCompetitive factors affecting the market position and success of each product include:\n• safety, side effect profile, effectiveness and market acceptance;\n• price, including third-party insurance reimbursement policies;\n• timing, introduction and marketer support of the product;\n• efficacy and execution of marketing and commercialization strategy;\n• market acceptance;\n• manufacturing, supply and distribution;\n• governmental regulation, including price caps;\n• availability of lower-cost generics or biosimilars;\n• intellectual property protection and exclusivity;\n• treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for a product; and\n• product liability claims.\nProducts on which we have a royalty receivable or other interest may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive by new or alternate products, including\ngenerics or biosimilars, improvements on existing products, marketing or commercialization strategies, or governmental or regulatory action. In addition, as\nbiopharmaceutical companies increasingly devote significant resources to innovate next-generation products and therapies, products on which we have a\nroyalty may become unattractive to commercialize or obsolete. If a product’s market acceptance is diminished or it is withdrawn from the market, continuing\npayments with respect to biopharmaceutical products may not be made on time or at all, which may affect our ability to realize the benefits of the royalty\nreceivable or other interest in such product and may result in us incurring asset impairment charges. Further, any product for which we have a royalty\nreceivable or other interest that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety in\norder to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. Many approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by\nphysicians, patients and third-party payors. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products. Any of these developments\ncould adversely affect products on which we have a royalty, and consequently could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n59\nMarketers of products that generate our royalties are outside of our control.\nIn the case of our royalty receivables, our cash flow consists primarily of payments supported by royalties paid by marketers. These marketers may have\ninterests that are different from our interests. For example, these marketers may be motivated to maximize their overall income by allocating resources to other\nproducts and, in the future, may decide to focus less attention on the products generating our royalties or by allocating resources to develop products that do not\ngenerate royalties to us. There can be no assurance that any marketer or person with whom the marketer has a working relationship has adequate resources or\nmotivation to continue to produce, market and sell the products generating our royalties. Aside from any limited audit rights relating to the activities of the\nmarketers that we may have in certain circumstances pursuant to the terms of our arrangements with the licensor, we do not have oversight rights with respect\nto the marketers’ operations and do not have rights allowing us to direct their operations or strategy nor do our agreements contain performance standards for\ntheir operations. The calculation of the royalty payments is subject to and dependent upon the adequacy and accuracy of our counterparties’ sales and\naccounting functions.\nWhile we may be able to receive certain information relating to sales of products through the exercise of audit rights and review of royalty reports we\nreceive from the licensor, such information may be received many months following our recognition of the royalty revenue, may require us to adjust our\nroyalty revenues in later periods and may require expense on our part.\nWe have limited information on the marketers’ operations. We will not have the right to review or receive certain information relating to products that the\nmarketers may have, including the results of any studies conducted by the marketers or others, or complaints from doctors or users of products. The market\nperformance of the products generating our royalties may therefore be diminished by any number of factors relating to the marketers that are outside of our\ncontrol.\nThe marketers of biopharmaceutical products are, generally, entirely responsible for the ongoing regulatory approval, commercialization,\nmanufacturing and marketing of products.\nGenerally, the holders of royalties on products have granted exclusive regulatory approval, commercialization, manufacturing and marketing rights to the\nmarketers of such products. The marketers have full control over those efforts and sole discretion to determine the extent and priority of the resources they will\ncommit to their program for a product. Accordingly, the successful commercialization of a product depends on the marketer’s efforts and is beyond our control.\nIf a marketer does not devote adequate resources to the ongoing development, regulatory approval, commercialization and manufacture of a product, or if a\nmarketer engages in illegal or otherwise unauthorized practices, the product’s sales may not generate sufficient royalties, or the product’s sales may be\nsuspended, and consequently, could adversely affect our business. In addition, if marketers of biopharmaceutical products decide to discontinue product\nprograms or we believe the commercial prospects of assets have been reduced, we may recognize material non-cash impairment charges related to the financial\nroyalty asset associated with those programs or assets.\nLicense agreements relating to products may, in some instances, be unilaterally terminated or disputes may arise which may affect our royalties.\nLicense agreements relating to the products generating our royalties may be terminated, which may adversely affect sales of such products and therefore\nthe payments we receive. For example, under certain license agreements, marketers retain the right to unilaterally terminate the agreements with the licensors.\nWhen the last patent covering a product expires or is otherwise invalidated in a country, a marketer may be economically motivated to terminate its license\nagreement, either in whole or with respect to such country, in order to terminate its payment and other obligations. In the event of any such termination, a\nlicensor may no longer receive all of the payments it expected to receive from the licensee and may also be unable to find another company to continue\ndeveloping and commercializing the product on the same or similar terms as those under the license agreement that has been terminated.\n60\nIn addition, license agreements may fail to provide significant protection for the licensor in case of the licensee’s failure to perform or in the event of\ndisputes. License agreements which relate to the products underlying our royalties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible\nto multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what the licensor believes to be the scope of\nits rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or decrease the licensee’s financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, any of which\ncould in turn impact the value of our royalties and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If a marketer were to default on its\nobligations under a license agreement, the licensor’s remedy may be limited either to terminating certain licenses related to certain countries or to generally\nterminate the license agreement with respect to such country. In such cases, we may not have the right to seek to enforce the rights of the licensor and we may\nbe required to rely on the resources and willingness of the licensor to enforce its rights against the licensee.\nIn any of these situations, if the expected payments under the license agreements do not materialize, this could result in a significant loss to us and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe insolvency of a marketer could adversely affect our receipt of cash flows on the related royalties that we hold.\nIf a marketer were to become insolvent and seek to reorganize under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code, as amended, or the Bankruptcy Code, or\nliquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (or foreign equivalent), such event could delay or impede the payment of the amounts due under a license\nagreement, pending a resolution of the insolvency proceeding. Any unpaid royalty payments due for the period prior to the filing of the bankruptcy proceeding\nwould be unsecured claims against the marketer, which might not be paid in full or at all. While royalty payments due for periods after the filing may qualify as\nadministrative expenses entitled to a higher priority, the actual payment of such post-filing royalty payments could be delayed for a substantial period of time\nand might not be in the full amount due under the license agreement. The licensor would be prevented by the automatic stay in the bankruptcy proceeding from\ntaking any action to enforce its rights without the permission of the bankruptcy court. In addition, the marketer could elect to reject the license agreement,\nwhich would require the licensor to undertake a new effort to market the applicable product with another distributor. Such proceedings could adversely affect\nthe ability of a payor to make payments with respect to a royalty, and could consequently adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of\noperations.\nUnsuccessful attempts to acquire new royalties could result in significant costs and negatively impact subsequent attempts to locate and acquire other\nassets.\nThe investigation of each specific target royalty and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements requires substantial management time\nand attention and results in substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to complete a specific acquisition, the costs incurred\nfor the proposed transaction would not be recoverable from a third party. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific target asset, we\nmay fail to consummate the acquisition for any number of reasons, including, in the case of an acquisition of a royalty through a business combination with a\npublic company, approval by the target company’s public shareholders. Multiple unsuccessful attempts to acquire new royalties could hurt our reputation, result\nin significant costs and an inefficient use of the Manager’s time. The opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources could negatively impact\nour ability to locate and acquire other assets.\nThe products that generate our royalties are subject to uncertainty related to healthcare reimbursement policies, managed care considerations, pricing\npressures and the regulation of the healthcare industry.\nIn both U.S. and non-U.S. markets, sales of biopharmaceutical products, and the success of such products, depends in part on governmental regulation\nand the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government healthcare programs in addition to private\ninsurance plans.\n61\nIn the United States, pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to enhanced government regulation, public scrutiny and calls for reforms. For example, the\ndrug pricing provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”), which was signed into law in August 2022 and began to be implemented in 2023 with\nimplementation efforts to continue over the next several years. In August 2023, the Biden Administration unveiled the first round of medicines subject to the\n“Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program,” which requires manufacturers of select drugs to engage in a process with the U.S. Federal government to set new\nMedicare prices which would go into effect in 2026. In addition, the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and\nEducation Reconciliation Act (the “ACA”) was enacted by Congress in March 2010 and established a major expansion of healthcare coverage, financed in part\nby several new rebates, discounts and taxes that had a significant effect on the expenses and profitability on the companies that manufacture the products that\ngenerate our royalties. These companies and their products face uncertainty due to federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify\nor invalidate some or all of the provisions of the IRA and the ACA.\nOther U.S. federal or state legislative or regulatory action or policy efforts could adversely affect the healthcare industry, including, among others,\nadditional transparency and limitations related to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, general budget\ncontrol actions, changes in patent laws, changing interpretations of competition law, exercise by the government of march-in rights in respect of government\nfunded innovations, the importation of prescription drugs from outside the United States at prices that are regulated by governments of various foreign\ncountries, revisions to reimbursement of biopharmaceutical products under government programs, restrictions on U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising or\nlimitations on interactions with healthcare professionals. No assurances can be provided that these laws and regulations will not adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\nContinued intense public scrutiny of the price of drugs, together with government and payor dynamics, may limit the ability of producers and marketers\nto set or adjust the price of products based on their value. There can be no assurance that new or proposed products will be considered cost-effective or that\nadequate third-party reimbursement will be available to enable the producer or marketer of such product to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an\nappropriate return. These pricing pressures may adversely affect our current royalties and the attractiveness of future acquisitions of royalties.\nOutside the United States, numerous major markets, including the EU, Japan and China, have pervasive government regulation of healthcare and\ngovernment involvement in funding healthcare, and, in that regard, fix the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those\nmarkets, the products generating our royalties are subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions.\nIn addition, many of the products in our portfolio benefit from regulatory exclusivity. If, in an effort to regulate pricing, regulatory exclusivity is not\nmaintained, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry may be negatively affected by federal government deficit reduction policies, which could reduce the value of the\nroyalties that we hold.\nIn an effort to contain the U.S. federal deficit, the biopharmaceutical industry could be considered a potential source of savings via legislative proposals.\nGovernment action to reduce U.S. federal spending on entitlement programs, including Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health\nprograms, or to lower drug spending, may affect payment for the products that generate our royalties. These and any other cost controls or any significant\nadditional taxes or fees that may be imposed on the biopharmaceutical industry as part of deficit reduction efforts could reduce cash flows from our royalties\nand therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSales of products that generate our royalties are subject to regulatory approvals and actions in the United States and foreign jurisdictions that could\nharm our business.\nThe procedures to approve biopharmaceutical products for commercialization vary among countries and can involve additional testing and time. Such\nprocedures may include on-site inspections by regulatory authorities at clinical trial sites or manufacturing facilities, which inspections may be delayed by\ntravel restrictions imposed in response to pandemics or other infectious diseases. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in\nother countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA.\nThe foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval and many include additional risks, such as pricing\napproval.\n62\nThere can be no assurance that any of these regulatory approvals will be granted or not be revoked or restricted in a manner that would adversely affect\nthe sales of such products and on the ability of payors to make payments with respect to such royalties to us.\nThe manufacture and distribution of a biopharmaceutical product may be interrupted by regulatory agencies or supplier deficiencies.\nThe manufacture of products generating our royalties is typically complex and is highly regulated. In particular, biopharmaceutical products are\nmanufactured in specialized facilities that require the approval of, and ongoing regulation by, the FDA in the United States and, if manufactured outside of the\nUnited States, both the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory agencies, such as the MHRA and the EMA. With respect to a product, to the extent that operational\nstandards set by such agencies are not adhered to, manufacturing facilities may be closed or production interrupted until such time as any deficiencies noted by\nsuch agencies are remedied. Any such closure or interruption may interrupt, for an indefinite period of time, the manufacture and distribution of a product and\ntherefore the cash flows from the related biopharmaceutical asset may be significantly less than expected.\nIn addition, manufacturers of a product may rely on third parties for selected aspects of product development, such as packaging or to supply bulk raw\nmaterial used in the manufacture of such product. In the United States, the FDA requires that all suppliers of pharmaceutical bulk materials and all\nmanufacturers of pharmaceuticals for sale in or from the United States adhere to the FDA’s current “Good Manufacturing Practice” regulations and guidelines\nand similar requirements that exist in jurisdictions outside the United States. Marketers of biopharmaceutical products generally rely on a small number of key,\nhighly specialized suppliers, manufacturers and packagers. Any interruptions, however minimal, in the operation of these manufacturing and packaging\nfacilities could adversely affect production and product sales and therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nProduct liability claims may diminish the returns on biopharmaceutical products.\nThe developer, manufacturer or marketer of a product could become subject to product liability claims. A product liability claim, regardless of its merits,\ncould adversely affect the sales of the product and the amount of any related royalty payments and could even adversely affect the ability of a payor to make\npayments with respect to a royalty.\nAlthough we believe that we will not bear responsibility in the event of a product liability claim against the developer, manufacturer, marketer or other\nseller of the product that generates our royalty. Any such product liability claims against us could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of\noperations.\nWe are typically not involved in maintaining, enforcing and defending patent rights on products that generate our royalties.\nOur right to receive royalties generally depends on the existence of valid and enforceable claims of registered or issued patents in the United States and\nelsewhere in the world. The products on which we receive payments are dependent on patent protection and on the fact that the manufacturing, marketing and\nselling of such products do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate intellectual property rights of third parties. Typically, we have no ability to control\nthe prosecution, maintenance, enforcement or defense of patent rights, but must rely on the willingness and ability of our partners or their marketers to do so.\nThere can be no assurance that these third parties will vigorously prosecute, maintain, enforce or defend such rights. Even if such third parties seek to\nprosecute, maintain, enforce or defend such rights, they may not be successful.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has\nbeen the subject of much litigation. Furthermore, changes in patent laws or interpretation of patent laws in the United States and in other jurisdictions could\nincrease the uncertainties surrounding the successful prosecution of patent applications and the successful enforcement or defense of issued patents by our\npartners, all of which could diminish the value of patent protection relating to the biopharmaceutical assets. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity,\nenforceability and commercial value of the patent rights of our partners and their marketers are highly uncertain. In addition, such third parties’ pending and\nfuture patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect their products, development-stage product candidates and technologies or which\neffectively prevent others from commercializing competitive products, development-stage product candidates and technologies. Moreover, the coverage\nclaimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance.\n63\nEven if the patent applications our partners and their marketers license or own do issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide them\nwith any meaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from competing with them or otherwise provide them with any competitive\nadvantage. Competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent patents of our partners and their marketers by developing similar or alternative\nproducts in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and may be challenged in\nthe courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or\nheld unenforceable, which could limit the ability of our partners and their marketers from preventing others from using or commercializing similar or identical\ntechnology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of their products, development-stage product candidates and technologies.\nAny loss or reduction in the scope or duration of patent protection for any product that generates our royalties, or any failure to successfully prosecute,\nmaintain, enforce or defend any patents that protect any such product may result in a decrease in the sales of such product and any associated royalties payable\nto us. Any such event would adversely affect the ability of the payor to make payments of royalties to us or may otherwise reduce the value of our royalties,\nand could consequently adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In cases where our contractual arrangements with our partner\npermit us to do so, we could participate in patent suits brought by third parties but this could result in substantial litigation costs, divert management’s attention\nfrom our core business and there can be no assurance that such suits would be successful.\nThe existence of third-party patents in relation to products may result in additional costs for the marketer and reduce the amount of royalties paid to us.\nThe commercial success of a product depends, in part, on avoiding infringement, misappropriation or other violations of the intellectual property rights\nand proprietary technologies of others. Third-party issued patents or patent applications claiming subject matter necessary or useful to manufacture and market\na product could exist or issue in the future. Such third-party patents or patent applications may include claims directed to the composition, manufacturing,\nmechanism of action or other unique features of a product. There can be no assurance that a license would be available to marketers for such subject matter if\nsuch infringement were to exist or, if offered, would be offered on reasonable or commercially feasible terms. Without such a license, it may be possible for\nthird parties to assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against the marketer of such product based on such patents or other intellectual property\nrights.\nEven if the marketer was able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving its competitors and other third parties access to the same\ntechnologies. In addition, if a marketer of a product that generates our royalties is required to obtain a license from a third party, the marketer may, in some\ninstances, have the right to offset the licensing and royalty payments to such third party against royalties that would be owed to our partner, which may\nultimately reduce the value of our royalty interest. An adverse outcome in infringement or other intellectual property-related proceedings could subject a\nmarketer to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require the marketer to cease or modify its\nmanufacturing, marketing and distribution of any affected product, any of which could reduce the amount of cash flow generated by the affected products and\nany associated royalties payable to us and therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDisclosure of trade secrets of marketers of products could negatively affect the competitive position of the products underlying our biopharmaceutical\nassets.\nThe marketers of the products that generate our royalties depend, in part, on trade secrets, know-how and technology, which are not protected by patents,\nto maintain the products’ competitive position. This information is typically protected through confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to such\ninformation, such as collaborative partners, licensors, employees and consultants. Any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose the confidential\ninformation or competitors might independently develop or learn of the information in some other way, which could harm the competitive position of the\nproducts and therefore reduce the amount of cash flow generated by our royalties.\n64\nOur ability to pay periodic dividends to our shareholders or make share repurchases may be limited by applicable provisions of English law and\ncontractual restrictions and obligations.\nUnder English law, we will only be able to declare dividends, make distributions or repurchase shares (other than out of the proceeds of a new issuance of\nshares for that purpose) out of profits available for distribution. Profits available for distribution are accumulated, realized profits, to the extent that they have\nnot been previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less its accumulated, realized losses, to the extent that they have not been previously written off in\na reduction or reorganization of capital duly made. The amount of our distributable reserves is a cumulative calculation. We may be profitable in a single\nfinancial year but unable to pay a dividend or make share repurchases if our accumulated, realized profits do not offset all previous years’ accumulated,\nrealized losses. Additionally, we may only make a distribution if our net assets are not less than the amount of our aggregate called-up share capital and\nundistributable reserves, and if, and to the extent that, the distribution does not reduce the amount of those assets to less than that aggregate.\nSubject to the terms of our indebtedness or other contractual obligations, the approval and payment of any interim dividends are at the sole discretion of\nour board of directors, which may change our dividend policy at any time, and the payment of any final dividends will be subject to majority approval by\nholders of our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares and in each case will be paid out of profits available for that purpose under English law. Our\nArticles of Association authorize the board of directors to approve interim dividends without shareholder approval to the extent that such dividends appear\njustified by profits available for such purpose. The board of directors may also recommend final dividends be approved and declared by shareholders at an\nannual general meeting. No such dividend may exceed the amount recommended by the board of directors.\nThere can be no assurance that any dividends, whether quarterly or otherwise, will or can be paid or that any shares will or can be repurchased. Whether\nwe pay dividends to our shareholders or make share repurchases depends on a number of factors, including among other things, general economic and business\nconditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our business and acquisition opportunities, our financial condition or results of operations, working capital\nrequirements and anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions and obligations, including fulfilling our current and future capital commitments, legal, tax and\nregulatory restrictions, other restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our shareholders or making any share repurchases and such\nother factors as our board of directors may deem relevant.\nA shareholder who receives a distribution under circumstances where he or she knows or has reasonable grounds for believing that the distribution is\nunlawful in the circumstances is obliged to repay such distribution (or that part of it, as the case may be) to us.\nIf we were determined to be an investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, applicable restrictions could make it impractical\nfor us to continue our business as contemplated and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act. An entity generally\nwill be determined to be an investment company for purposes of the U.S. Investment Company Act if, absent an applicable exemption, (i) it is or holds itself\nout as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities; or (ii) it owns or proposes to\nacquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an\nunconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the ICA 40% Test.\nWe do not hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, or propose to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities,\nand believe that we are not engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. We believe that, for U.S. Investment Company\nAct purposes, we are engaged primarily, through one or more of our subsidiaries, in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring certain obligations that\nrepresent part or all of the sales price of merchandise. Our subsidiaries that are so engaged rely on Section 3(c)(5)(A) of the U.S. Investment Company Act,\nwhich, as interpreted by the SEC staff, requires each such subsidiary to invest at least 55% of its assets in “notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable,\nand other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance, and services,” which we refer to as the ICA Exception Qualifying\nAssets.\n65\nIn a no-action letter, dated August 13, 2010, to our predecessor, the SEC staff promulgated an interpretation that royalty interests that entitle an issuer to\ncollect royalty receivables that are directly based on the sales price of specific biopharmaceutical assets that use intellectual property covered by specific\nlicense agreements are ICA Exception Qualifying Assets under Section 3(c)(5)(A). We rely on this no-action letter for the position that royalty receivables\nrelating to biopharmaceutical assets that we hold are ICA Exception Qualifying Assets under Section 3(c)(5)(A) and Section 3(c)(6), which is described below.\nTo ensure that we are not obligated to register as an investment company, we must not exceed the thresholds provided by the ICA 40% Test. For purposes\nof the ICA 40% Test, the term investment securities does not include U.S. government securities or securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are\nnot themselves investment companies and are not relying on Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the U.S. Investment Company Act, such as majority-owned\nsubsidiaries that rely on Section 3(c)(5)(A). We also may rely on Section 3(c)(6), which, based on SEC staff interpretations, requires us to invest, either directly\nor through majority-owned subsidiaries, at least 55% of our assets in, as relevant here, businesses relying on Section 3(c)(5)(A). Therefore, the assets that we\nand our subsidiaries hold and acquire are limited by the provisions of the U.S. Investment Company Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nIf the SEC or its staff in the future adopts a contrary interpretation to that provided in the no-action letter to our predecessor or otherwise restricts the\nconclusions in the SEC staff’s no-action letter such that royalty interests are no longer treated as ICA Exception Qualifying Assets for purposes of Section 3(c)\n(5)(A) and Section 3(c)(6), or the SEC or its staff in the future determines that the no-action letter does not apply to some or all types of royalty receivables\nrelating to biopharmaceutical assets, our business will be materially and adversely affected. In particular, we would be required either to convert to a\ncorporation formed under the laws of the United States or a state thereof (which would likely result in our being subject to U.S. federal corporate income\ntaxation) and to register as an investment company, or to stop all business activities in the United States until such time as the SEC grants an application to\nregister us as an investment company formed under non-U.S. law. It is unlikely that such an application would be granted and, even if it were, requirements\nimposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on our capital structure, our ability to transact business with affiliates and our ability to\ncompensate key employees, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted. Our ceasing to qualify for an exemption from\nregistration as an investment company could materially and adversely affect the value of our Class A ordinary shares and our ability to pay dividends in respect\nof our Class A ordinary shares.\nThe equity performance awards payable to an affiliate of the Manager may create incentives that are not fully aligned with the interests of our\nshareholders.\nSubject to certain conditions, at the end of each fiscal quarter, an affiliate of the Manager is entitled to a distribution in the form of equity from RP\nHoldings in respect of each portfolio equal to 20% of the Net Economic Profit (defined as the aggregate cash receipts for all new portfolio investments in such\nportfolio less Total Expenses (defined as interest expense, operating expense and recovery of acquisition cost in respect of such portfolio)) for such portfolio\nfor the applicable measuring period (the “Equity Performance Awards”). The right to Equity Performance Awards may create an incentive for the Manager to\nmake riskier or more speculative asset acquisitions. In addition, the Manager may cause us to incur more debt, finance additional asset acquisitions or\notherwise use more leverage in connection with asset acquisitions, as generally the use of leverage can increase the rate of return on an investment and\ntherefore our profits. Under certain circumstances, the use of borrowed money may pose higher risks for our business or increase the likelihood of default,\nwhich would disfavor our shareholders. In addition, there is no correlation between our profits and the obligation of our board of directors to pay dividends to\nshareholders. Consequently, shareholders may receive limited or no dividends while an affiliate of the Manager remains entitled to Equity Performance Awards\nbased on our Net Economic Profit. In addition, even though Equity Performance Awards are payable on a portfolio-by-portfolio basis (with portfolios\ncomprised of investments made during sequential two-year periods) in order to reduce the risks that affiliates of the Manager will be paid Equity Performance\nAwards on individual investments even though our overall portfolio of investments is not performing well, Equity Performance Awards may nevertheless be\npayable to affiliates of the Manager when our overall portfolio of investments is not performing as well as the individual portfolios that are used as the basis for\nmeasuring the Equity Performance Awards.\n66\nOur board of directors may make decisions with respect to the cash generated from our operations that may result in no dividends paid to our\nshareholders or no repurchases made of our ordinary shares.\nOur board of directors is under no obligation to pay dividends, make distributions or repurchase our ordinary shares and it may decide to use cash to fund\nasset acquisitions or operations in lieu of paying dividends, making distributions or repurchasing our ordinary shares. We will pay Equity Performance Awards\nto an affiliate of the Manager based on our Net Economic Profit regardless of whether any dividends are paid to our shareholders or any ordinary shares are\nrepurchased. Our board of directors’ decisions with respect to our cash may result in no dividends to our shareholders and no ordinary shares repurchased.\nFurthermore, our board of directors’ decisions with respect to dividends or repurchases of ordinary shares may adversely affect the market price of our Class A\nordinary shares. If we generate positive income, but pay limited or no dividends, holders of Class A ordinary shares may, if they have made certain elections for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to their Class A ordinary shares, have a tax liability on our income in excess of the actual cash dividends received\nby such holders. If our board of directors decides to approve limited or no dividends or repurchases of ordinary shares, the primary remedy for holders of Class\nA ordinary shares will be to sell their shares at the prevailing market price, including at a loss, which may be low due to unfavorable or inconsistent dividends\nor repurchases of our ordinary shares.\nThe royalties that we acquire may fall outside the biopharmaceutical industry, and any such assets, and the cash flows therefrom, may not resemble the\nassets in our current portfolio.\nWe have discretion as to the types of assets that we may acquire. While we expect the Manager to acquire assets that primarily fall within the\nbiopharmaceutical industry, we are not obligated to do so and may acquire other types of assets that are peripheral to or outside of the biopharmaceutical\nindustry. Consequently, our asset acquisitions in the future, and the cash flows from such assets, may not resemble those of the assets in our current portfolio.\nWe and the Manager may have limited experience acquiring assets that are peripheral to or outside of the biopharmaceutical industry. There can be no\nassurance that assets acquired in the future will have returns similar to the returns expected of the assets in our current portfolio or be profitable at all.\nThe Manager may be the subject of a change of control resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nThere could be a change of control of the Manager and, in such a case, the new controlling party may have a different philosophy, employ less\nexperienced advisory professionals, be unsuccessful in identifying royalty acquisition opportunities or have a track record that is not as successful as that of the\nManager. If the foregoing were to occur, we could experience difficulty in making new asset acquisitions, and the value of our existing assets, our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations could materially suffer.\nThe Manager’s liability is limited under the Management Agreement, and we have agreed to indemnify the Manager against certain liabilities. As a\nresult, we could experience unfavorable operating results or incur losses for which the Manager would not be liable.\nThe Manager does not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for under the Management Agreement. The Manager and its\naffiliates (including RPI EPA Holdings, LP (“EPA Holdings”)) and their respective officers, directors, equity holders, members, employees, agents and partners,\nand any other person who is entitled to indemnification (each, an “Indemnitee”) is not liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our directors, our shareholders or any\nsubsidiary’s shareholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with to the Management Agreement, except those resulting from acts\nconstituting fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence (as interpreted under New York law) and a material breach of the Management Agreement\nthat is not cured or a violation of applicable securities laws.\nIn addition, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we have agreed to indemnify the Indemnitees from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages,\nlosses, penalties, actions, judgments, costs and expenses (including amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines and\npenalties and legal or other costs and reasonable expenses of investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim) of any nature whatsoever, known or\nunknown, liquidated or unliquidated that are incurred by any Indemnitee or to which such Indemnitee may be subject by reason of its activities on behalf of us\nor any of our subsidiaries to the extent that such Indemnitee’s conduct did not constitute fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence (as interpreted\nunder New York law), material breach of the Management Agreement that is not cured or a violation of applicable securities laws. As a result, we could\nexperience unfavorable operating results or incur losses for which the Manager would not be liable.\n67\nOperational risks may disrupt our businesses, result in losses or limit our growth.\nWe rely heavily on the Manager’s financial, accounting, information and other data processing systems and cloud computing services, as well as those of\nour current and future collaborators, contractors or consultants. Such systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, data corruption,\ncyber-related attacks, unauthorized access, natural disasters, pandemics, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If any of these events\noccur and such systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there is any unauthorized disclosure of data, whether as a result of tampering, a breach of\nnetwork security systems, a cybersecurity vulnerability or attack or otherwise, we could suffer substantial financial loss, increased costs, a disruption of our\nbusiness, loss of trade secrets or other proprietary information, liability to us, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.\nFurthermore, federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to data privacy and protection, such as the European Union’s General Data\nProtection Regulation, which took effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, can expose us to\nenforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities, and potentially result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability, if our information\ntechnology security efforts or data privacy and protection compliance efforts fail. In addition, we operate a business that is highly dependent on information\nsystems and technology. The Manager’s information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, and the cost of\nmaintaining such systems may increase. Such a failure to accommodate growth, or an increase in costs related to such information systems, could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA disaster or a disruption in the public infrastructure that supports our business, including a disruption involving electronic communications or other\nservices used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business, could adversely affect our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption.\nOur disaster recovery programs and those of the Manager may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. In\naddition, insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all.\nIn addition, sustaining our growth may require us or the Manager to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new\nprofessionals to join the team and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. Since the market for hiring\ntalented professionals is competitive, we may not be able to grow at the pace we desire.\nWe are subject to the U.K. Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, import and\ncustoms laws, trade and economic sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (“Bribery Act”), the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977,\nas amended the (“FCPA”), the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. §201, the U.S. Travel Act, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in\ncountries where we do business. The Bribery Act, the FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from authorizing,\npromising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper or prohibited payments, or anything else of value, to government officials or other persons to\nobtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. Under the Bribery Act, we may also be liable for failing to prevent a person associated with us\nfrom committing a bribery offense. We and the marketers of products that generate our royalties operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of\npotential Bribery Act or FCPA violations, and we participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose corrupt or illegal activities could\npotentially subject us to liability under the Bribery Act, FCPA or local anti-corruption laws, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of\nsuch activities. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be\nsubject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the\nUnited Kingdom and the United States, and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions and\nembargoes on certain countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively\nreferred to as the “Trade Control laws.”\n68\nThere is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Bribery Act,\nthe FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws\nor Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which\ncould have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of\nthe Bribery Act, the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by the United Kingdom, United States or other authorities could adversely affect\nour reputation, our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial\ncosts. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business\nactivities or our business arrangements with third parties could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. It is possible that governmental\nauthorities will conclude that our business practices or the business practices of the marketers of products that generate our royalties may not comply with\ncurrent or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations or the\noperations of the marketers of products that generate are royalties are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations, we or\nmarketers of products that generate our royalties may be subject to significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, including monetary penalties,\ndamages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and\nMedicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we or marketers of products that generate our royalties become subject to a corporate integrity\nagreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, reputational harm, and we or marketers of products that generate our\nroyalties may be required to curtail or restructure operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of\noperations.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory\nauthorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully\ndefend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting\ncompliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance or\nreporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.\nThe EU directive on alternative investment fund managers (the “AIFM Directive”) may significantly increase our compliance costs.\nThe AIFM Directive has been implemented into the national law of the majority of member states of the European Economic Area and the United\nKingdom (each an “AIFM state”). The AIFM Directive sets out minimum conditions related to the marketing of interests in alternative investment funds (such\nas our Class A ordinary shares) in the AIFM states and may impact our ability to attract investors in the AIFM states and may significantly increase our and the\nManager’s compliance costs. Such conditions include requirements for us to register with the competent authority in the relevant AIFM state in order to market\nthe Class A ordinary shares to investors, requirements to file periodic reports with the competent authority in the relevant AIFM state and requirements to\ncomply with disclosure and reporting obligations in respect of investors in the relevant AIFM state. Such reports and disclosures may become publicly\navailable. While such conditions are met in relation to the AIFM states where our Class A ordinary shares will be marketed, there can be no guarantee that this\nwill continue to be the case. The AIFM Directive does not, however, prohibit an investor in such AIFM state from subscribing for our Class A ordinary shares\nat their own initiative in circumstances where such Class A ordinary shares have not been marketed in such AIFM state and we may issue our Class A ordinary\nshares to such investors, as long as they have provided us and the Manager with representations that they have done so at their own initiative.\n69\nIn each AIFM state, our Class A ordinary shares may only be offered to investors in accordance with local measures implementing the AIFM Directive.\nInvestors, together with any person making or assisting in the decision to invest in us, who are situated, domiciled or who have a registered office, in an AIFM\nstate where our Class A ordinary shares are not being offered pursuant to private placement rules implementing the AIFM Directive may invest, or effect an\ninvestment in our Class A ordinary shares, but only in circumstances where they do so at their own initiative. Any investor acquiring our Class A ordinary\nshares at their own initiative in such AIFM state should note that as we have not been registered for marketing in that AIFM state, no reports will be filed with\nthe competent authority in the relevant AIFM state by or in respect of us and no investor shall be entitled to receive any disclosure or report that is mandated in\nrespect of an alternative investment fund being marketed pursuant to the AIFM Directive.\nThe United Kingdom implemented the AIFM Directive through the Alternative Investment Managers Regulations 2013 and the Financial Conduct\nAuthority’s Handbook. Following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal the European Union and the expiration of the transitional period, the rules applicable to\nthe marketing of interests in alternative investment funds in the United Kingdom and the other AIFM states remained largely aligned. However, there are now\nareas of divergence which may make it more time consuming and complex for us to market our Class A ordinary shares to investors in the United Kingdom and\nother AIFM states which, in turn, may significantly increase compliance costs.\nRisks Relating to Our Organization and Structure\nWe are a holding company with no operations and rely on our subsidiaries to provide us with the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and\nto pay dividends.\nWe are a holding company with no material direct operations. Our principal asset is our controlling equity interest in RP Holdings. As a result, we are\ndependent on loans, dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends\nor make distributions to our shareholders. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and may be prohibited or restricted from providing loans, paying\ndividends or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. If the cash we receive from our subsidiaries is insufficient for us to fund our\nfinancial obligations, we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of debt, the issuance of equity or the sale of assets to fund. However, there is no\nassurance that we would be able to raise cash by these means. If the ability of any of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or payments to us\nis materially restricted by regulatory or legal requirements, bankruptcy or insolvency, or our need to maintain our financial strength ratings, or is limited due to\noperating results or other factors, it could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends or make distributions to our\nshareholders.\nOur structure will result in tax distributions as a result of the RP Holdings Class C Special Interest.\nRP Holdings is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and has owners that are subject to U.S. federal income taxation. RP Holdings\nis required to make cash distributions, or tax distributions, to the direct owner or beneficial owners of the RP Holdings Class C Special Interest, calculated\nusing an assumed tax rate that is generally uniform for all recipients regardless of their tax status. Funds used by RP Holdings to satisfy its tax distribution\nobligations will not be available for reinvestment in our business, dividends or share repurchases.\nRisks Relating to Our Ordinary Shares\nThe market price of our Class A ordinary shares has been and may in the future be volatile, which could cause the value of our shareholders’\ninvestment to decline.\nThe market price of our Class A ordinary shares has been and may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide\nexperience significant price and volume fluctuations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the per share trading price of our Class A ordinary shares\nfluctuated from a low of $26.21 to a high of $39.40. Market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market\nprice of Class A ordinary shares in spite of our operating performance. In addition to the factors discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, our operating\nresults could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors, including:\n• market conditions in the broader stock market in general, or in our industry in particular;\n• variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends to shareholders or share repurchases;\n70\n• additions or departures of key management personnel at the Manager;\n• timing and rate of capital deployment, including relative to estimates;\n• changes in our portfolio mix or acquisition strategy;\n• failure to meet analysts’ earnings estimates;\n• publication of research reports about our industry;\n• third-party healthcare reimbursement policies and practices;\n• litigation and government investigations;\n• changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting our business;\n• no results, or projected results, from marketers of products that generate our royalties;\n• results from, and any delays to, the clinical trial programs of development-stage product candidates underlying our biopharmaceutical assets or other\nissues relating to such products, including regulatory approval or commercialization;\n• adverse market reaction to any indebtedness that we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n• changes in market valuations of similar companies or speculation in the press or investment community;\n• announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n• economic and political conditions or events, such as pandemics, inflation and interest volatility and global conflicts; and\n• adverse publicity about us or the industries in which we participate or individual scandals.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price of and demand for our Class A ordinary shares to fluctuate significantly, which may limit or prevent\nour shareholders from reselling their Class A ordinary shares at or above the purchase price.\nStock markets in general have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including in recent months. In addition, in the past,\nfollowing periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted\nagainst public companies. This type of litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and\nresources.\nOur Articles of Association provide that the courts of England and Wales will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of all shareholder complaints\nother than complaints asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and that the U.S. federal district courts will be the\nexclusive forum for the resolution of any shareholder complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.\nOur Articles of Association provide that the courts of England and Wales will be the exclusive forum for resolving all shareholder complaints other than\nshareholder complaints asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and that the U.S. federal district courts will be the\nexclusive forum for resolving any shareholder complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. This choice of\nforum provision may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors,\nofficers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits. If a court were to find either choice of forum provision contained in our Articles of Association to\nbe inapplicable or unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our\nresults of operations and financial condition.\n71\nU.S. investors may have difficulty enforcing civil liabilities against our company, our directors or members of senior management and the experts\nnamed herein.\nWe are a public limited company with our registered office in England and our subsidiaries are incorporated in various jurisdictions, including\njurisdictions outside the United States. One of our directors is not a resident of the United States, and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of this\ndirector are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process on this director in the United States or to\nenforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against us or this director based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws or otherwise. Even if\nshareholders are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of England may render shareholders unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or\nthe assets of our directors and executive officers. In addition, it is doubtful whether English courts would enforce certain civil liabilities under U.S. securities\nlaws in original actions or judgments of U.S. courts based upon these civil liability provisions. In addition, awards of punitive damages in actions brought in\nthe United States or elsewhere may be unenforceable in the United Kingdom. An award for monetary damages under the U.S. securities laws would likely be\nconsidered punitive if it does not seek to compensate the claimant for loss or damage suffered and is intended to punish the defendant. The enforceability of\nany judgment in the United Kingdom will depend on the particular facts of the case as well as the laws and treaties in effect at the time. The United States and\nthe United Kingdom do not currently have a treaty providing for recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and\ncommercial matters. As a result of the above, shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interest through actions against our management,\ndirectors or other shareholders than they would as shareholders of a U.S. public company.\nThe rights of our shareholders may differ from the rights typically offered to shareholders of a U.S. corporation.\nWe are incorporated under English law. The rights of our shareholders are governed by English law, including the provisions of the Companies Act 2006\n(the “U.K. Companies Act”), and by our Articles of Association. These rights differ in certain respects from the rights of shareholders in typical U.S.\ncorporations.\nThe U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the “Takeover Code”) applies, among other things, to an offer for a public company whose registered\noffice is in the United Kingdom (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man) and whose securities are not admitted to trading on a regulated market in the United\nKingdom (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man) if the company is considered by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (the “Takeover Panel”) to have its\nplace of central management and control in the United Kingdom (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man). This is known as the “residency test.” Under the\nTakeover Code, the Takeover Panel will determine whether we have our place of central management and control in the United Kingdom by looking at various\nfactors, including the structure of our board of directors, the functions of the directors and where they are resident.\nGiven that our central management and control is situated outside the United Kingdom (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man), we do not anticipate\nthat we will be subject to the Takeover Code. However, if at the time of a takeover offer, the Takeover Panel determines that we have our place of central\nmanagement and control in the United Kingdom (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man), we would be subject to a number of rules and restrictions,\nincluding but not limited to the following: (i) our ability to enter into deal protection arrangements with a bidder would be extremely limited; (ii) we might not,\nwithout the approval of our shareholders, be able to perform certain actions that could have the effect of frustrating an offer, such as issuing shares or carrying\nout acquisitions or disposals; and (iii) we would be obliged to provide equality of information to all bona fide competing bidders.\nUnder English law, and whether or not we are subject to the Takeover Code, an offeror for us that has acquired (i) 90% in value of; and (ii) 90% of the\nvoting rights carried by the shares to which the offer relates may exercise statutory squeeze-out rights to compulsorily acquire the shares of the non-assenting\nminority. However, if an offer for us is conducted by way of a scheme of arrangement the threshold for the offeror obtaining 100% of Company shares\ncomprises two components (i) approval by a majority in number of each class of Company shareholders present and voting at the shareholder meeting; and (ii)\napproval of Company shareholders representing 75% or more in value of each class of Company shareholders present and voting at that meeting.\n72\nAs an English public limited company, certain capital structure decisions will require shareholder approval, which may limit our flexibility to manage\nour capital structure.\nWe are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. English law provides that a board of directors may only allot shares\n(or rights to subscribe for or convert into shares) with the prior authorization of shareholders, such authorization stating the aggregate nominal amount of shares\nthat it covers and valid for a maximum period of five years, each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution. We obtained\nshareholder authority to allot additional shares until the end of the next annual general meeting of the Company or, if earlier, the close of business on the date\nthat is 15 months after June 6, 2024. The Company intends to seek renewal of this authorization at each year’s annual general meeting of shareholders.\nEnglish law prohibits us from repurchasing our shares by way of “off market purchases” without the prior approval of shareholders by ordinary resolution\n(i.e., majority of votes cast by our shareholders), and other formalities. Such approval may be for a maximum period of up to five years but may be sought\nmore frequently. English law prohibits us from conducting “on market purchases” as our shares are listed on the NASDAQ and will not be traded on a\nrecognized investment exchange in the United Kingdom.\nOur shareholders approved the authorization of certain “off market purchases” that will expire five years from June 23, 2022 unless renewed by our\nshareholders prior to the expiration date. We cannot assure shareholders that situations will not arise where such shareholder approval requirements for any of\nthese actions would deprive our shareholders of substantial capital management benefits.\nThe United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union and differing regulatory regimes may have a negative effect on global economic\nconditions, financial markets and our business, which could reduce the market price of our Class A ordinary shares.\nThe withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) took effect on January 31, 2020. Brexit has caused,\nand may continue to cause, uncertainty with respect to the future of the United Kingdom’s economic and political relationship with the European Union, which\ncould increase taxes and costs of business and cause heightened volatility in currency exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could also adversely affect the\npolitical, regulatory, economic or market conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and worldwide, and could contribute to instability in political\ninstitutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets, which in turn, could adversely affect our operations and the market price of our Class A ordinary shares.\nIf our Class A ordinary shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearing within the facilities of DTC, then transactions in our securities may be\ndisrupted.\nThe facilities of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) are a widely-used mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the\nparticipants in the DTC system, which include many banks and brokerage firms. While our Class A ordinary shares are eligible for deposit and clearing within\nthe DTC system, DTC has discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for our Class A ordinary shares, including to the extent that any\nchanges in U.K. law change the stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax position in relation to the Class A ordinary shares. If DTC determined that the Class A\nordinary shares were not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities, our Class A ordinary shares may not be eligible for continued listing\non the NASDAQ and trading in the Class A ordinary shares would be disrupted. While we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve our listing and\nmaintain trading, any such disruption could adversely affect the market price of our Class A ordinary shares and our access to the capital markets.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain\nqualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the requirements of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\n(“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and the requirements of the U.K. Companies Act and, if applicable, the Takeover Code. The requirements of these rules and\nregulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our\nsystems and resources.\n73\nWe are obligated to file with the SEC annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in the Exchange Act, and therefore will need to\nhave the ability to prepare financial statements that are compliant with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. In addition, we are subject to other\nreporting and corporate governance requirements, including certain requirements of Nasdaq and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the\nregulations promulgated thereunder, which will impose significant compliance obligations upon us.\nWe are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control\nover financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time\nperiods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC, negatively affect investor confidence\nin our financial statements, restrict access to capital markets and adversely impact the market price of our Class A ordinary shares.\nOur compliance with the requirements under the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the U.K. Companies Act and, if applicable, the Takeover Code\nand the rules and regulations thereunder increases our legal and financial compliance costs and makes some activities more time consuming and costly. These\nrules and regulations have made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, and we may in the future be\nrequired to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more\ndifficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We may not be able to predict or estimate\naccurately the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nRisks Relating to Taxation\nOur structure involves complex provisions of tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. Our structure also is subject to\npotential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis.\nOur tax treatment, including Irish, U.K. and U.S. federal income tax treatment, depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of\ncomplex provisions of applicable tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. You should be aware that our tax position is not free from\ndoubt, and that applicable tax rules are generally subject to ongoing review by legislative and administrative bodies and relevant tax authorities, as well as by\nthe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), which is continuously considering recommendations for changes to existing tax\nrules. Furthermore, over 140 member jurisdictions of the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework have joined the Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges\nof the Digitalization of the Economy as part of the OECD’s base erosion and profit sharing project (“BEPS”), which includes a reallocation of taxing rights\namong market jurisdictions and a global minimum tax rate of 15% (“Pillar Two”). As part of the ongoing release of Pillar Two rules by various jurisdictions,\nthe Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 (the “UK Act”) was enacted on July 11, 2023, and implements the OECD’s BEPS Pillar Two income inclusion rule, including a\nmultinational top-up tax and a domestic top-up tax to the minimum effective tax rate of 15% for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023.\nThe UK Act also includes a transitional safe harbor election for accounting periods beginning on or before December 31, 2026. Similar legislation was enacted\nin Ireland on December 18, 2023 (the “Irish Act”). While we do not expect the Pillar Two rules to apply to us, there remains a risk that a tax authority in any\nrelevant jurisdiction implementing Pillar Two could adopt or interpret legislation, statements or guidance in a manner that is inconsistent with our\nunderstanding of the UK Act, the Irish Act and OECD’s BEPS Pillar Two model rules and associated commentary. As proposals to change tax laws and the\nimplementation of the BEPS framework remain subject to further negotiation, we are currently unable to predict the extent to which any changes to tax laws,\nstatutes, rules, regulations or ordinances will occur and, if so, the ultimate impact on our business. These review processes could result in revised\ninterpretations of established concepts, statutory changes, revisions to regulations and other modifications and interpretations. No ruling will be sought from\nthe relevant tax authority regarding any of the tax issues discussed herein, and no assurance can be given that the relevant tax authorities will not challenge any\nof our tax positions and that such challenge would not succeed. If any such position is successfully challenged, our tax reporting or tax liabilities could\nmaterially increase, which would adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.\nThere have been significant changes both made and proposed to international tax laws that increase the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance for\nall multinational companies. We expect to continue to monitor these and other developments in international tax law.\n74\nWe could be liable for significant taxes due to changes in our eligibility for certain income tax treaty benefits or challenges to our tax positions with\nrespect to the application of income tax treaties.\nOur subsidiaries expect to receive revenues from both U.S. and non-U.S. sources. We expect that our subsidiaries generally will be eligible for benefits\nunder the applicable income tax treaties between Ireland and the jurisdictions where income is sourced. However, no assurances can be provided in this regard,\nand it is possible that a taxing authority could successfully assert that any of our subsidiaries does not qualify for treaty benefits as a result of its failure to\nsatisfy the applicable requirements to be eligible to claim treaty benefits. If a taxing authority were to challenge our position regarding the application of an\napplicable income tax treaty, we could become subject to increased withholding taxes, and such taxes could be significant.\nSpecifically, with respect to certain U.S.-source income, we expect that our subsidiaries will be eligible for benefits under the U.S.-Ireland income tax\ntreaty (the “Treaty”), and, under that Treaty, will not be subject to any U.S. withholding taxes on such U.S.-source payments. Our current treaty position with\nrespect to U.S.-source payments relies in part on U.S. citizens or tax residents (as defined for purposes of the Treaty) owning, directly or indirectly, at least 50%\nof the beneficial interest in, or at least 50% of the aggregate vote and value of, each of our subsidiaries that earns U.S.-source income. Our treaty position is\nbased on the current U.S. status of the majority of the existing indirect investors in RP Holdings and Old RPI. Subject to certain exceptions, the existing\nindirect U.S. investors in RP Holdings have the right to exchange their interests for our publicly traded Class A ordinary shares. Such publicly traded Class A\nordinary shares could be further transferred on the public market to other persons. Therefore, it is possible that over time U.S. persons will own indirectly in the\naggregate less than 50% of the interests in our subsidiaries. We currently expect that our Class A ordinary shares and other existing indirect interests in RP\nHoldings and Old RPI in the aggregate will continue to be owned in sufficient amount by U.S. citizens or tax residents, and that we will be able to establish\nsuch ownership, for purposes of satisfying the 50% ownership requirement under the Treaty. However, there is no assurance that RP Holdings and Old RPI will\ncontinue to be owned directly or indirectly by sufficient U.S. citizens or residents or that we will be able to establish to the IRS’ satisfaction such ownership for\npurposes of satisfying the 50% U.S. ownership requirement under the Treaty. It is possible that if the indirect U.S. ownership in our subsidiaries becomes lower\nthan 50% (or we cannot establish such ownership) we may in the future be able to qualify for another applicable exemption from U.S. withholding under the\nTreaty, but there can be no assurance in this regard. A substantial portion of our revenue is, and is expected to continue to be, derived from U.S.-sourced\nincome, such as royalties, interest or “other income” for Treaty purposes. Therefore, if our subsidiaries failed to qualify for an exemption from U.S.\nwithholding tax under the Treaty (by satisfying either the 50% U.S. ownership requirement or an alternative Treaty exemption) and such types of income were\nsubject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, our financial position, profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, on August 25, 2016, the Irish Department of Finance announced that, in the context of the publication by the United States Treasury\nDepartment of a revised U.S. Model Income Tax Convention in February 2016, discussions have begun with the United States Treasury on updating certain\nelements of the Treaty. It is at this time not clear what elements of the Treaty may be updated, or when any such updates would go into effect. However, certain\nelements of the revised U.S. Model Income Tax Convention could, if included in an update to the Treaty, result in our subsidiaries being unable to qualify for\nthe benefits of the Treaty or eliminate or reduce the benefits of the Treaty that otherwise would have been available to us. If our subsidiaries are unable to\nqualify for the benefits of the Treaty, or if any benefits of the Treaty that otherwise would have been available to us are eliminated or reduced, then all or a\nportion of our income may become subject to increased withholding taxes, and such taxes could be very significant and materially and adversely affect our\nfinancial position, profitability and cash flows.\n75\nIf our subsidiaries are considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business, we could be liable for significant U.S. taxation.\nIn general, if a foreign corporation, such as Royalty Pharma plc, is considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business, such corporation’s share of any\nincome that is effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business will be subject to regular U.S. federal income taxation (currently imposed at a maximum\nrate of 21%) on a net basis and, potentially, an additional 30% U.S. “branch profits” tax on distributions attributable to income that is effectively connected\nwith such U.S. trade or business. In addition, it is possible that such corporation could be subject to taxation on a net basis by state or local jurisdictions within\nthe United States. We intend to conduct our activities, through our subsidiaries, such that no income realized by us will be effectively connected with the\nconduct of a U.S. trade or business or otherwise subject to regular U.S. federal income taxation on a net basis. If we are able to conduct our activities in this\nway, income or gains realized by us will not be subject to U.S. net federal income taxation. However, no assurance can be provided in this regard. The proper\ncharacterization of our income and gains for U.S. tax purposes is not certain, and it is possible that all or a portion of our income and gains could be\ncharacterized as income that is “effectively connected” with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. If our income and gains were characterized as effectively\nconnected with a U.S. trade or business, we would be subject to significant U.S. taxes plus interest and possible penalties, and our financial position, cash flows\nand profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe expect to operate, and expect that RP Holdings will operate, so as to be treated solely as a resident of the U.K. for tax purposes, but changes to our\nmanagement and organizational structure or to the tax residency laws of other jurisdictions where we operate may cause the relevant tax authorities to\ntreat us or RP Holdings as also being a resident of another jurisdiction for tax purposes.\nUnder current U.K. tax law, a company that is incorporated in the U.K. is regarded as resident for tax purposes in the U.K. unless (i) it is concurrently\ntreated as resident for tax purposes in another jurisdiction (applying the rules of that other jurisdiction for determining tax residency) that has a double tax\ntreaty with the U.K. and (ii) there is a residency tie-breaker provision in that tax treaty which allocates tax residence to that other jurisdiction.\nBased upon our anticipated management and organizational structure, we believe that we and RP Holdings should be regarded as tax resident solely in the\nU.K. However, because this analysis is highly factual and may depend on future changes in our management and organizational structure, as well as future\nchanges in the tax residency laws of other jurisdictions where we operate, there can be no assurance regarding the determination of our tax residence in the\nfuture.\nAs U.K. tax resident companies, we and RP Holdings will be subject to U.K. corporation tax on our worldwide taxable profits and gains. Should we (or\nRP Holdings) be treated as resident in a jurisdiction other than the U.K., we (or RP Holdings, as applicable) could be subject to taxation in that jurisdiction and\nmay be required to comply with a number of material and formal tax obligations, including withholding tax or reporting obligations provided under the relevant\ntax law, which could result in additional costs and expenses.\nWe believe that we should not be subject to material U.K. corporation tax in respect of certain profits of our non-U.K. tax resident subsidiaries as a\nresult of the U.K.’s “controlled foreign companies” rules but it cannot be guaranteed that this will continue to be the case.\nAs U.K. tax resident companies, we and RP Holdings will be subject to the U.K.’s “controlled foreign companies” rules (the “U.K. CFC Rules”). The\nU.K. CFC Rules, broadly, can impose a charge to U.K. tax on U.K. tax resident companies that have, alone or together with certain other persons, interests in a\nnon-U.K. tax resident company (the “Controlled Foreign Company”) which is controlled by a U.K. person or persons. The charge under the U.K. CFC Rules\napplies by reference to certain types of chargeable profit arising to the Controlled Foreign Company, whether or not that profit is distributed, subject to specific\nexemptions. The types of profits of a Controlled Foreign Company that can potentially be subject to a U.K. corporation tax charge under the U.K. CFC Rules\ninclude business profits of the Controlled Foreign Company that are attributable to assets or risks that are managed by activities in the U.K., or certain finance\nprofits of the Controlled Foreign Company that arise from capital or other assets contributed, directly or indirectly, to the Controlled Foreign Company from a\nconnected U.K. tax resident company.\n76\nCertain non-U.K. entities in which we hold a greater than 25% interest, including RPI 2019 ICAV (which is Irish tax resident) and Old RPI (which is Irish\ntax resident and which is held indirectly by us through our participation in RP Holdings), will be Controlled Foreign Companies for U.K. tax purposes. We and\nRP Holdings will therefore be required to apply the CFC Rules in respect of our direct and indirect interests in these entities on an ongoing basis. We do not\nexpect material U.K. corporation tax charges to arise under the U.K. CFC Rules in respect of our royalty assets or our financing arrangements, however no\nassurances can be given that this will continue to be the case. The U.K. CFC Rules are highly complex and fact-dependent, and changes to, or adverse\ninterpretations of, these rules, or changes in the future activities of RPI 2019 ICAV or other non-U.K. companies in which we hold an interest, directly or\nindirectly, may alter this position and could impact our group’s effective tax rate.\nWe believe that dividends received by us and RP Holdings should be exempt from U.K. corporation tax, but it cannot be guaranteed that this will\ncontinue to be the case.\nU.K. tax resident companies are subject to U.K. corporation tax on receipt of dividends or other income distributions in respect of shares held by them,\nunless those dividends or other distributions fall within an exempt class. We believe that dividends received by us from RP Holdings, and dividends received by\nRP Holdings from RPI 2019 ICAV, should fall within such an exempt class and therefore should not be subject to U.K. corporation tax. However, a number of\nconditions must be met in order for such dividends to qualify for this tax exemption, including (in respect of dividends paid by RPI 2019 ICAV, which is tax\nresident in Ireland) conditions relating to the application of Irish tax law. As such, it cannot be guaranteed that these conditions for the U.K. tax exemption in\nrespect of distributions will continue at all times to be satisfied. If distributions received by us or by RP Holdings were not to fall within an exempt class, such\ndistributions would likely be subject to U.K. corporation tax at the then prevailing corporation tax rate.\nEven where distributions fall within an exempt class, certain anti-avoidance and recharacterization rules may also apply. For instance, if RPI 2019 ICAV\nwere to constitute an “offshore fund” for U.K. tax purposes that has at any time in an accounting period more than 60% by market value of its investments in\ndebt securities, money placed at interest (other than cash awaiting investment), certain contracts for differences, or in holdings in other offshore funds with,\nbroadly, more than 60% of their investments similarly invested, RP Holdings’ shareholding in RPI 2019 ICAV may be subject to U.K. corporation tax as a\ndeemed “loan relationship”, with the result that dividends received by RP Holdings from RPI 2019 ICAV could be subject to U.K. tax as deemed interest and\nRP Holdings may be subject to U.K. corporation tax on increases in the fair market value of its shareholding in RPI. The term “offshore fund” is defined for\nU.K. tax purposes through a characteristics-based approach and, broadly, can include arrangements constituted by a non-U.K. resident body corporate in which\na reasonable investor would expect to be able to realize their investment entirely, or almost entirely, by reference to net asset value. We believe and have been\nadvised that RP Holdings’ shareholding in RPI 2019 ICAV should not fall within these rules, however no guarantee can be offered that this will continue to be\nthe case. Changes to, or adverse interpretations of, the offshore funds rules, or changes in the nature of our investments, may alter this position and could\nimpact our group’s effective rate.\n77\nWe expect to be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could subject U.S. holders of our Class A ordinary shares to adverse\nU.S. federal income tax consequences. Distributions that we pay to individual and other non-corporate U.S. holders will not be eligible for taxation at\nreduced rates, which could potentially adversely affect the value of our Class A ordinary shares.\nWe generally expect that our income, which consists primarily of passive income, and our assets, which consist primarily of assets that produce passive\nincome, will result in our treatment as a PFIC for the current taxable year and future taxable years. We intend to annually furnish U.S. holders a “PFIC Annual\nInformation Statement” with the information required to allow shareholders to make a qualified electing fund (“QEF”) election for United States federal\nincome tax purposes on our website. U.S. holders who do not make a QEF election with respect to us or a mark-to-market election with respect to our Class A\nordinary shares will be subject to potentially material adverse tax consequences, including (i) the treatment of any gain on disposition of our Class A ordinary\nshares as ordinary income and (ii) the application of a deferred interest charge on such gain and the receipt of certain distributions on our Class A ordinary\nshares. In addition, regardless of whether a QEF or mark-to-market election is made with respect to us, U.S. holders will be required to file an annual report on\nIRS Form 8621 containing such information with respect to its interest in a PFIC as the IRS may require. Failure to file IRS Form 8621 for each applicable\ntaxable year may result in substantial penalties and result in audit by the IRS. Further, if we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder owns\nour Class A ordinary shares, we generally would continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to that U.S. holder for all succeeding years during which such\nperson holds our Class A ordinary shares, even if we ceased to meet the threshold requirements for PFIC status, unless the U.S. holder makes a special\n“purging” election on IRS Form 8621. The effect of these adverse tax consequences could adversely affect our U.S. shareholders and make investment in our\nClass A ordinary shares less attractive to U.S. investors.\nDistributions made to non-corporate U.S. holders will not be eligible for taxation at reduced tax rates generally applicable to dividends paid by certain\nU.S. corporations and “qualified foreign corporations” because of our status as a PFIC. The more favorable rates applicable to qualifying corporate dividends\ncould cause individuals to perceive investment in our Class A ordinary shares to be less attractive than investment in the shares of other corporations because of\nour PFIC status, and this perception could adversely affect the value of our Class A ordinary shares.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nCybersecurity vulnerabilities or other failures in information systems could result in information theft, data corruption and significant disruption of our\nbusiness operations.\nCybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks (such as the recent increasing use of\n“ransomware” and phishing attacks), as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human error, catastrophic events (such as fires, floods, hurricanes and\ntornadoes), and technological errors, pose a risk to our systems and data. An attack could result in security breaches, theft, lost or corrupted data,\nmisappropriation of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, loss of trade secrets and commercially valuable information, operating downtimes\nand operational disruptions. We attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, monitoring and testing, and\nmaintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, but we have been subject to cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the past and expect to be subject to them\nin the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing cybersecurity vulnerabilities or mitigating their effects. Any cyber-related\nattack or failure or loss of data could adversely affect our business. In addition, we may suffer reputational harm or face litigation as a result of cyber-related\nattacks or other data security breaches and may incur significant additional expense to implement further data protection measures.\nWe rely on information technology systems and networks, including cloud and third-party service providers, to process, transmit and store electronic\ninformation in connection with our business activities. These information technology systems and networks may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or\nshutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components, power outages, hardware failures or computer\nviruses. If these information technology systems suffer severe damage or disruption and the issues are not resolved in a timely manner, our business, financial\ncondition or operations could be adversely affected.\n78\nIn addition, the use of artificial intelligence-based software (including machine learning) is increasingly being used in our industry. As with many\ndeveloping technologies, artificial intelligence-based software presents risks that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our\nbusiness. For example, algorithms may be flawed; data sets may be insufficient, of poor quality, or contain biased information; and inappropriate or\ncontroversial data practices by data scientists, engineers, and end-users could impair results. If artificial intelligence (“AI”) applications assist in producing\ndeficient or inaccurate analyses, we could be subjected to competitive harm, potential legal liability or reputational harm. AI algorithms may use third-party\ninformation with unclear intellectual property rights or interests. If we do not have sufficient rights to use the data or other material or content on which any AI\nsolutions we use rely, we may incur liability through the violation of applicable laws and regulations, third-party intellectual property, privacy or other rights,\nor contracts. Because AI technology itself is highly complex and rapidly developing, it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational or technological\nrisks that may arise relating to the use of AI.\nCollaborators, other contractors or consultants in use today or in the future are vulnerable to damage or interruption from these cybersecurity\nvulnerabilities, other failures in information systems and artificial intelligence-based software risks. If such an event were to occur in the future and cause\ninterruptions in their operations, it could result in a disruption of their development and commercialization programs and business operations, whether due to a\nloss of trade secrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of,\nor damage to, a counterparties’ data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, our partners’ operations may be\nharmed and the development and commercialization of their products, development-stage product candidates and technologies could be delayed. Such an event\nmay reduce the amount of cash flow generated by the related biopharmaceutical products and therefore adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nChanges in the application of accounting standards issued by the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may\nadversely affect our financial statements.\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which are periodically revised, interpreted or expanded. From time to time, we are\nrequired to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required\nto adopt may require changes to the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and may require us to make significant\nchanges to our systems. Such changes could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nCOVID-19, or the future outbreak of any other infectious or contagious diseases, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition\nand cash flows.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and its variants has severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in\nfinancial markets. COVID-19 and other future health outbreaks and pandemics could lead to quarantines, mandating business and school closures and\nrestricting travel, or trigger global economic slowdowns or global recessions. COVID-19 or another pandemic could adversely affect us due to, among other\nfactors:\n• a general decline in business activity;\n• the destabilization of the markets could negatively impact our partners in the biopharmaceutical industry and the sales of products generating our\nroyalties;\n• difficulty accessing the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets,\nor deteriorations in credit and financing conditions which could affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations or address\nmaturing liabilities on a timely basis;\n• the potential negative impact on the health of our Manager’s highly qualified personnel, especially if a significant number of them are impacted;\n• a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption;\n79\n• interruptions, shortages, delivery delays and potential discontinuation of supply to our partners, which could (i) delay the clinical trials of the\ndevelopment-stage product candidates underlying our assets and result in a loss of our market share for products generating our royalties or\ndevelopment-stage product candidates underlying our assets, if approved, and (ii) hinder our partners’ ability to timely distribute products\ngenerating our royalties and satisfy customer demand;\n• travel restrictions, shelter-in-place policies or restrictions and other disruptions, which could cause or continue to cause delays and other direct\nimpacts at our partners’ manufacturing sites, which could impact the ability of our partners to manufacture development-stage product candidates\nunderlying our biopharmaceutical assets and products generating our royalties; and\n• potential interruptions to our partners’ clinical trial programs of development-stage product candidates underlying our biopharmaceutical assets,\nincluding: (i) the potential diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials to focus on pandemic concerns; (ii) changes in\nhospital or research institution policies or government regulations, which could delay or adversely impact our partners’ ability to conduct their\nclinical trials; and (iii) pauses to or delays of trial procedures (particularly any procedures that may be deemed non-essential), patient dosing,\nshipment of our partners’ development-stage product candidates, distribution of clinical trial materials, study monitoring, site inspections and data\nanalysis due to reasons related to the pandemic, each of which could cause or continue to cause a disruption or delay to the development or the\napproval of development-stage product candidates underlying our biopharmaceutical assets.\nLegal claims and proceedings could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be subject to a wide variety of legal claims and proceedings. Regardless of their merit, these claims can require significant time and expense to\ninvestigate and defend. Since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or\nproceedings, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection therewith, will be consistent with the\nultimate outcome of such matters. The resolution of, or increase in the reserves taken in connection with, one or more of these matters could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCorporate responsibility matters and any related reporting obligations may impact our business.\nU.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on corporate responsibility matters. For example, new U.S.\nand international laws and regulations relating to corporate responsibility matters, including human capital, diversity, sustainability, climate change and\ncybersecurity, are under consideration or being adopted, which may include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response will\nrequire additional investments and implementation of new practices and reporting processes, all entailing additional compliance risk. In addition, we have\nannounced a number of corporate responsibility initiatives and goals, which will require ongoing investment, and there is no assurance that we will achieve any\nof these goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes. Perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks\nto our reputation. Any harm to our reputation resulting from our focus on corporate responsibility matters and goals or our failure or perceived failure to meet\nsuch goals could impact employee retention, the willingness of our partners to do business with us, or investors’ willingness to purchase or hold our ordinary\nshares, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to implement some initiatives or\nachieve some goals is dependent on external factors. For example, our ability to meet certain sustainability goals or initiatives may depend in part on third-\nparty collaboration, mitigation innovations or the availability of economically feasible solutions.\nItem 2.

I am delighted to report another excellent quarter of execution against our strategy as\nthe leading funder of innovation in life sciences. Slide 6 summarizes our continued business momentum in the third quarter. In terms of the\nfinancials, we delivered 15% growth in Portfolio Receipts, our top line, and also in Royalty Receipts.\nAs a reminder, Royalty Receipts represents our recurring cash inflows and are driven by our high-quality portfolio of more than 35 commercial\nproducts. Turning to capital allocation, we continue to be very active in acquiring new royalties and our pipeline remains robust. On a year-to-date\nbasis, our capital deployment now stands at approximately $2.6 billion.\nIn addition, as part of our balanced capital allocation strategy and given our strong fundamental outlook, we repurchased another $95 million of\nour shares in the quarter. Looking at our portfolio, we have recently acquired royalties on three novel therapies. Two of these came through synthetic\nroyalty transactions, an important opportunity, which Marshall and Chris will expand on.\nWe're also delighted to see our portfolio progress nicely with the FDA approvals of Cobenfy in schizophrenia and Voranigo in glioma and Tremfya\nin ulcerative colitis. We expect each of these to be important new growth drivers for Royalty Pharma.\nLastly, I am happy to report we're raising our full year 2024 guidance following our strong performance in the first nine months of the year, driven\nby the momentum of our diversified portfolio. We now expect Portfolio Receipts to be between $2.75 billion and $2.8 billion.\nThis update is based on expected growth in Royalty Receipts of around 11% to 13%, which compares with our previous guidance of 9% to 12%.\nConsistent with our standard practice, this guidance is based on our current portfolio and does not include the benefit of future transactions.\nSlide 7 shows that our unique business model has powered strong growth since our IPO. As I noted earlier, we delivered 15% growth in Royalty\nReceipts in the third quarter, which brings our year-to-date growth to 14%. This consistent track record of strong growth speaks to our ability to\nexecute successfully against our strategy in the growing market for biopharma royalties. With that, I will hand it over to Marshall.\nMarshall Urist - Royalty Pharma PLC - Executive Vice President - Research and Investments\nThanks, Pablo. I want to focus today on three exciting recent royalty transactions. Slide 9 summarizes our transaction with Syndax announced this\nweek to acquire a synthetic royalty in Niktimvo in the US. Niktimvo is the first FDA-approved anti-CSF-1R antibody for chronic graft versus host\ndisease, or chronic GvHD, and launch is expected no later than early in the first quarter of 2025.\nIncyte is already the market leader in chronic GvHD with Jakafi and will co-commercialize the therapy with Syndax. We paid $350 million upfront\nin return for a 13.8% royalty on US net sales of Niktimvo, and we expect the royalty will have a duration extending to the late-2030s and project\nan IRR in the low double-digits.\nTurning to slide 10. For those less familiar, chronic GvHD is a serious immune-driven, multi organ disorder that is estimated to develop in about\n42% of stem cell transplant recipients. Importantly, it can cause severe symptoms for patients and even mortality. With nearly 50% of chronic GvHD\npatients requiring at least three lines of therapy, there is clear unmet need for additional treatment options like Niktimvo, which has a differentiated\nmechanism of action and demonstrated impressive efficacy and encouraging safety in Phase 3.\nBased on the unmet need and compelling clinical results in third-line chronic GvHD, the FDA approved Niktimvo in August, and we see an attractive\ncommercial opportunity based on the current label. We also note that the most recent new medicine for chronic GvHD Sanofi's Rezurock, which\nlaunched in 2021, is annualizing at greater than $500 million in sales.\nSlide 11 summarizes a couple of additional smaller recent transactions totaling around $300 million in announced value. Both therapies address\nan unmet patient need, have a compelling differentiated profile, and the consensus projects each to be a blockbuster generating attractive returns\nfor Royalty Pharma. The synthetic royalty on Yorvipath marks our second transaction with Ascendis. The product is FDA-approved for\n3\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

In the second transaction shown here, we acquired a pre-existing royalty from BRAIN\nBiotech AG on a promising oral therapy, Deucrictibant, for hereditary angioedema in Phase 3 development by Pharvaris.\nAcross the two transactions, the combined peak royalty potential based on consensus would be greater than $100 million annually to our Royalty\nReceipts, providing additional momentum to the already attractive long-term growth outlook for our portfolio. And with that, I'll hand it over to\nChris.\nChristopher Hite - Royalty Pharma PLC - Vice Chairman, Executive Vice President\nThanks, Marshall. Having just heard about two recent examples of synthetic royalties, I wanted to drill down a little further on this opportunity.\nSlide 13 describes why we believe synthetic royalties are such an attractive funding modality. We pioneered this innovative solution in which we\ncreate new royalties as a non-dilutive funding solution for our partners.\nThere are many reasons why this approach has benefits for our partners, whether they are small biotechs or big pharma companies. Not only does\nthis allow us to tailor a solution to meet our partners' needs, it provides independent validation of the asset and allows the partner to retain\noperational control. Furthermore, it aligns our long-term interest with those of our partners. And lastly, we can add value through our proprietary\nanalytics, like claims analysis or real-world evidence data, something that we're really investing in and feel will be very important in the future. It's\na true win-win approach, and we believe synthetics will be increasingly utilized in the coming years. Slide 14 shows that historically biopharma\nfunding has been dominated by equity, licensing deals, and debt. Synthetic royalties have been a small part, just 3% of the overall funding picture\nover the last five years. From our ongoing partnership discussions, we now see these synthetic royalties are being routinely discussed at the Board\nlevel and C-suites as an important and growing funding modality. Our expectation is that synthetics will continue to be a fast-growing business\nopportunity in the coming years.\nConsistent with this growing opportunity, we announced synthetic royalty transactions of $775 million in 2023, which represented a doubling\nsince the year of our IPO. In 2024, we have already achieved another record year with the value of synthetic transactions at $800 million. With the\nadvantages I described and the huge funding required for life sciences innovation, we see tremendous scope for further growth in the synthetic\nroyalty funding. With that, I'd like to hand it over to Terry.\nTerrance Coyne - Royalty Pharma PLC - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\nThanks, Chris. Let's move to slide 16. This slide shows how our efficient business model generates substantial cash flow to be reinvested. As you\nheard from Pablo, Royalty Receipts grew by 15% in the third quarter, reflecting the strength of our diversified portfolio.\nThe key drivers of growth were the strong performance of Trelegy, Evrysdi, the cystic fibrosis franchise, and Tremfya. There was minimal income\nfrom Milestones and other contractual receipts, so Portfolio Receipts, our top line, also grew by 15% to $735 million.\nAs we move down the column, operating professional costs equated to 7.5% of Portfolio Receipts. Net interest paid of $62 million reflected the\nsemi-annual timing of our interest payment schedule with payments in the first and third quarters. This does not reflect interest on the $1.5 billion\nof incremental debt that we raised this past summer, with the first interest payments for those new tranches expected in the first quarter of 2025.\nMoving further down the column, we have consistently stated that when we think of the cash generated by the business to then be redeployed\ninto value-enhancing royalties, we look to Portfolio Cash Flow, which is Adjusted EBITDA less net interest paid.\nThis amounted to $617 million in the quarter, equivalent to a margin of around 84%. This high level of cash conversion once again underscores\nthe efficiency of our business model. Capital deployment in the third quarter was $1.2 billion, which in addition to the transaction we just announced\nwith Syndax, takes our total for the year to approximately $2.6 billion.\n4\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

In total, we have approximately $3 billion\navailable through a combination of cash on our balance sheet, the cash our business generates, and access to the debt markets.\nAt the end of the third quarter, we had cash and equivalents of $950 million. In terms of our borrowing position, we have investment-grade debt\noutstanding of $7.8 billion. As a reminder, we have a weighted average cost of debt of 3.1% and a weighted average maturity of around 12 years,\nwhich closely aligns with the duration of our royalty portfolio.\nOur leverage now stands at around three times total debt to Adjusted EBITDA. We also have undrawn financial capacity from our $1.8 billion\nrevolver. As Pablo noted, we continue to take advantage of the fundamental disconnect in our share price and repurchased $95 million of our\nshares in the quarter, taking our total spend on buybacks to $180 million through the first nine months of 2024.\nSlide 18 is a reminder of our capital allocation strategy and how we expect this to drive shareholder value creation. At our Investor Day in 2022, we\noutlined that over a five-year period through a combination of cash generation and our debt capacity, we expected to have access to around $20\nbillion of capital.\nAs you can see on this slide, we expect to deploy the majority of our capital on value-enhancing royalty acquisitions with a target of $10 billion to\n$12 billion invested over the period. As of today, we are on track to meet or exceed this target, having announced transactions of $10 billion with\nactual capital deployment of $7.2 billion in less than three years.\nWe aim to balance this primary focus on royalty acquisitions with returning capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share\nrepurchases. Regarding the latter, the Board authorized a multiyear share buyback program of up to $1 billion in March 2023, of which we have\nspent approximately $484 million through the third quarter.\nWhile investing in royalties is our number one priority, we use our share buyback program tactically for repurchases when we see a disconnect\nbetween our intrinsic value and the stock price. By executing against this capital allocation strategy, we are confident we'll continue to deliver our\nmission of accelerating innovation in life sciences, while generating strong returns and creating significant shareholder value.\nSlide 19 provides our raised full year 2024 financial guidance. We now expect portfolio receipts to be in the range of $2.75 billion to $2.8 billion.\nLet me walk through our assumptions. First, within our overall top-line guidance, we expect to deliver in royalty receipt -- growth in Royalty Receipts\nof around 11% to 13%.\nThe increase from our previous guidance of 9% to 12% reflects the strong momentum of our diversified portfolio. Second, when we moved to\nPortfolio Receipts, we faced a high base of comparison as a result of the $525 million of accelerated Biohaven-related payments we received last\nyear. Milestones and other contractual receipts are, therefore, expected to decline from around $600 million in 2023 to approximately $30 million\nin 2024.\nLastly, our guidance assumes a negligible foreign exchange impact. Importantly, and consistent with our standard practice, this guidance is based\non our portfolio as of today and does not take into account the benefit of any future royalty acquisitions.\nTurning to operating costs. Payments for operating professional costs are now expected to be approximately 8.5% of Portfolio Receipts in 2024.\nInterest paid for full year 2024 is expected to be around $160 million with a de minimis amount to be paid in Q4.\nThis does not take into account any interest received on our cash balance, which was $37 million for the first nine months of the year. It also does\nnot reflect interest payments on the $1.5 billion of notes issued in June of 2024, for which the first payment will be paid in the first quarter of 2025.\nMy final slide drills down further on our expected Portfolio Receipts and Royalty Receipts performance in 2024. Starting with the left-hand side,\nyou can see the high base of comparison due to the approximately $600 million of milestones and other contractual receipts we received in 2023,\nwhich was primarily due to the accelerated Biohaven-related payments.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

With that, I'd like to hand the call back to Pablo.\nPablo Legorreta - Royalty Pharma PLC - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Terry. Let me begin my concluding remarks by saying how pleased I am with our performance in the first nine months of 2024. We delivered\ndouble-digit growth in Royalty Receipts. We raised our guidance twice. We significantly strengthened our portfolio, and we maintained our\nleadership position in the fast-growing royalty market.\nMy final slide highlights that we have announced transactions worth up to $10.1 billion since the start of 2022, with actual capital deployed of $7.2\nbillion today. What you see here, too, is the healthy balance between approved and development-stage therapies.\nThis extraordinary level of activity highlights the power of our business model as well as the powerful secular tailwinds in our industry. It also puts\nus on track to meet or exceed our five-year capital deployment target of $10 billion to $12 billion.\nGiven this incredible record of delivery against our strategy, I have never been more confident that Royalty Pharma is well-positioned to deliver\nattractive compounding growth over the remainder of the decade and beyond. With that, we will be happy to take your questions.\nGeorge Grofik - Royalty Pharma PLC - Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Communications\nWe will now open up the call to your questions. Operator, please take the first question.\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Chris Schott, JPMorgan.\nHardik Parikh - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC - Analyst\nThis is Hardik Parikh in for Chris Schott. Congratulations on the results. Just wondering on the recent Cobenfy, KarXT label -- avoided the kind of\nthe typical black box that you see with kind of other antipsychotics. I'm just wondering, how does that compare to your base case scenario?\nPablo Legorreta - Royalty Pharma PLC - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nMarshall, this question is for you.\nMarshall Urist - Royalty Pharma PLC - Executive Vice President - Research and Investments\nThank you for the question. So we were really happy to see the Cobenfy approval. And we thought the label looked great and are really excited to\nsee the launch unfold in the quarters to come. If you take a step back about what Cobenfy says about how we approach building our portfolio, I\nthink it's a great example of identifying an area where there's lots of unmet patient need, having a product that has differentiated -- very differentiated\n6\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

As we’ve mentioned before, also the fact that now it's in Bristol's\nhands, and they'll then be able to really maximize its benefit for patients and its commercial value is exactly the kind of things that we look for and\nhope to happen and hope to happen with our products.\nSo to answer your question, we're really happy with the label and excited about it as a new part of our portfolio.\nOperator\nGeoff Meacham, Citi.\nGeoff Meacham - Citi - Analyst\nJust had a couple. Terry, when I look at the growth in the CF business, it's moderated a bit over the past few years, and that could continue going\nforward or perhaps even get worse. So the question is, does this change the urgency that you guys have for newer deals or how you look at the\nmagnitude of newer investments. I wasn't sure if the CF contribution had any impact on your thinking there.\nAnd second question for Marshall, I guess, when you look at the -- some of the more rapid high impact launches past couple of years, like I'm\nthinking about COVID or GLP-1s, the commercial piece for those categories came together pretty quickly. Has your process or sort of your filter\nevolved to capture more of these types of opportunities that could inflect faster or has it changed at all?\nTerrance Coyne - Royalty Pharma PLC - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\nYeah. So Geoff, on your CF question, CF has been obviously a great contributor for Royalty Pharma and been a consistent outperformer versus sort\nof expectations over the last couple of years. Certainly, there's sort of the law of big numbers at play here, but we still think it has nice growth ahead\nof it.\nSo I think we still see it as a nice contributor for Royalty Pharma longer term. And as far as urgency to invest away, I think as assets mature and\nthings roll off, or that's just sort of the natural cycle of any pharmaceutical business. And I think that what we've shown is the ability to sort of have\na lot of resilience in the face of any of those typical headwinds that businesses do.\nAnd I think that it's been by doing the same thing we've been doing, which is this consistent approach of identifying great assets, deploying capital\nconsistently, and focusing on the highest quality assets that will drive the next wave of growth. I think that we've added things like that to our\nportfolio over the last couple of years with the Evrysdi and Tremfya, Trelegy, Cobenfy. So I think that we'll keep doing more of the same. We feel\nreally good about the opportunity ahead and feel really good about our ability to continue to grow.\nPablo Legorreta - Royalty Pharma PLC - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nGeoff, maybe just add one other perspective here. It's Pablo. But I will ask you the question, how many businesses do you know in pharma, life\nsciences, with the kind of diversification we have and really robust portfolio that have an ability to actually deliver double-digit growth consistently\nover a long period of time?\nAnd obviously, you have situations that we all know about. Some -- Lilly or Novo that have benefited from obesity drugs that grew significantly\nover a period of time, but many of those companies always face very significant cliffs on their products. And in our case, we have more than actually\nclose to three decades now of consistent double-digit growth in the top line, and that's really unique.\n7\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

So I don't think it's changed because of the ramp of those products. The reason for that is the\nshape of the launch has always been something we thought a lot about because if you think about royalty investments, the two biggest drivers\nare, of course, the peak sales and the launch trajectory and the shape that which you get there, and both of those make a very significant contribution\nto value.\nSo thinking about the ramp and how products ramp has always been fundamental to our process. And so there's been no change there in reality.\nSome things can launch quickly, like the examples you point out, and some we have to think a lot about can't structurally either because of the\npayer channel that they're in and getting access or that patients need to be identified or other sorts of issues.\nSo that's always something our business has demanded that we spend a lot of time thinking about, so no change. But certainly, when we see things\nthat, of course, have the opportunity to both have a really attractive peak sales and a faster launch, that's obviously a more attractive profile.\nPablo Legorreta - Royalty Pharma PLC - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nAnd Geoff, maybe adding also here an additional comment because it seems to me that the question you asked was in relation to business models\nthat exist in life sciences, where there's new opportunities to invest in, new novel therapies that are going to drive significant growth.\nAnd you should just think how much easier it is for Royalty Pharma to actually take advantage of those new ways of innovation and add to our\nportfolio over a very short period of time. We can do it over a year or two, whereas many of the bigger companies, it can take them five years or\n10 years to actually participate in a new exciting class of drugs. And in our case, we can do it much, much faster given the flexibility of our business\nmodel.\nOperator\nUmer Raffat, Evercore.\nMike DiFiore - Evercore ISI - Analyst\nThis is Mike DiFiore in for Umer. Congrats on the quarter. A quick question on Niktimvo. Maybe could you outline the expected timeline for US\nmarket penetration and ramp to peak sales following its early 2025 launch as well as any thoughts on how we should think about its probability\nof success in IPF?\nMarshall Urist - Royalty Pharma PLC - Executive Vice President - Research and Investments\nYeah. Thanks, Mike. So we are really excited as we talked about in the prepared remarks about Niktimvo. And specifically, in terms of the launch\nand market penetration, this is an area with a lot of unmet patient need. We highlighted a recent precedent product, which had a really nice launch\nas well.\nAnd so through our team's extensive diligence, talking to physicians about their patient, the patients that they're caring for and the unmet need.\nWe are hopeful that there will be material demand for this as the product launches and we certainly have a benefit of having insight as in the\nmarket.\nAs I'm sure you know, they have a very significant presence here and really did a lot did a lot to develop the GvHD market with Jakafi. So we are --\nand we are excited about it. And then specifically on IPF, IPF is still early. There are certainly some mechanistic reasons to be hopeful about it. But\nit's still early in a Phase 2 trial. We always like opportunities like this where there are opportunities for upside to our forecast based on something\nlike IPF or also, you didn't mention it, but Niktimvo is being studied in earlier lines of therapy for GvHD. So our base case and the base investment\n8\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

But certainly, things like IPF and\nearlier lines of therapy in GvHD are exciting as well.\nOperator\nTerence Flynn, Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn - Morgan Stanley - Analyst\nGreat. I know you guys aren't going to provide guidance yet for '25. But maybe, Terry, you could just talk high level about some of the puts and\ntakes here. And then, Chris, maybe just how you think about the deal environment shaping up for 2025. And any implications from the election\nhere as you think about your business model on the forward.\nTerrance Coyne - Royalty Pharma PLC - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President\nYeah. So Terence, I think it's probably premature to start talking much about 2025 at this point. I think that we feel really good about the portfolio\nthat we have. I think that there's a lot of assets in there that have nice growth ahead of them.\nA few that are maturing, but I think that overall, we feel really good about the portfolio and really good about the opportunity to add great assets\nas we've been doing throughout this year. I think that as we usually do, I think we'll probably really delve into 2025 on our fourth quarter call.\nChristopher Hite - Royalty Pharma PLC - Vice Chairman, Executive Vice President\nAnd Terence, your question about deal environment. We are super excited about what we see. Obviously, this year, we've done $2.6 billion already\nyear to date. Pablo gave the numbers since 2022, we've announced $10.1 billion in deal volume since 2022. And we've announced $15.5 billion\nsince 2020. So we see just an ever-increasing opportunity out there.\nObviously, the demand for capital in the biopharma sector with large pharma all the way down to small and mid-cap biotech are immense. And\nso we can play an increasing role in that, whether that's existing royalties or synthetic royalties. So we're super excited about that. As it relates to\nthe new administration that would come in next year, too soon to tell, I think, is what I would say. But we don't really -- we've shown the ability to\ninvest a lot of capital regardless of the administration, just given the needs of the sector for capital. And so we're looking forward to the continued\nstrong environment in the deal sector.\nPablo Legorreta - Royalty Pharma PLC - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nJust one quick thing about next year and then the following years is that we're going to start to see really exciting readouts of some of the investments\nwe have in our pipeline in pelacarsen, for example, and Cobenfy. So maybe that's one thing to pay attention to.\nOperator\nMichael Nedelcovych, TD Cowen.\nMichael Nedelcovych - TD Cowen - Analyst\nI have two. My first relates to Cobenfy. I'm curious if you have an expectation for the upcoming emraclidine readout from AbbVie. And if that agent\nends up showing a clinical profile similar to Cobenfy, would you view that as a competitive threat or more of a rising tide, lifts all boats type scenario?\n9\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

'Refinitiv' and the Refinitiv logo are registered trademarks of Refinitiv and its affiliated companies.\nNOVEMBER 06, 2024 / 1:30PM, RPRX.OQ - Q3 2024 Royalty Pharma PLC Earnings Call\nAnd then my second question is on Tremfya in UC, in remodeling, do you assume significant uptake in frontline you see? Or do you think that\nTremfya will primarily compete in sort of second or third line biologics space?\nPablo Legorreta - Royalty Pharma PLC - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nDo you want to take those two questions, Marshall?\nMarshall Urist - Royalty Pharma PLC - Executive Vice President - Research and Investments\nSure. So your line was a little rough, but I think I got both of the questions. So specifically on the upcoming readout for a competitive product at\nAbbVie, emraclidine to Cobenfy in schizophrenia. So our approach when we think about new classes like this, especially where there are multiple\ndevelopment programs, is we do think a lot about the competition. And in this case, certainly, we assumed that there would be competition in\nthis space, in this sector, given the importance of the mechanism and the unmet needs. So that was in our base case. And certainly, we expect it\nto be multiple members of this class, like we've seen before in multiple classes in psychiatry.\nAnd I think given the scale of the unmet need to have two companies investing and developing this next generation of agents and developing\nthe market beyond what's available today is a good thing. So that was how we thought about emraclidine.\nAnd then for Tremfya, I think our view here is you have a great combination of one of the strongest marketers in the world in inflammatory bowel\ndisease, a great product, Tremfya with strong data behind it. And so we think, and I think some of Janssen's comments support this, that IBD and\nUC within that are going to be a significant growth driver for the product.\nSo I think if you think about first line versus second and third line, it's hard to generalize about simply just because of the access situation and the\npayers. But I think the important thing for Royalty Pharma as we look forward is, of course, that we do see a very meaningful opportunity for Tremfya\nin IBD.\nOperator\nChris Shibutani, Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani - Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc. - Analyst\nGreat. With the synthetic royalties and the opportunity there that you announced, particularly with Syndax, and then juxtaposing this against the\nfact that historically, you've been able to adapt some of the deal structures and expand upon relationships. Can you just educate us a little bit in\nterms of some of the parameters that were set up here, in particular, the 2.35 times cap and how that is defined in the context of potential additional\nopportunities for Niktimvo. And is it structured in a way that lets you to continue to specifically adopt the opportunity with Niktimvo? Or if you\nwere to go back essentially to Syndax and do another deal, would it have to be for another product?\nPablo Legorreta - Royalty Pharma PLC - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Thank you for the question. Chris, do you want to take that question?\n10\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Thanks for the question, Chris. The synthetic royalty opportunity is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we try to tailor every\ntransaction to really create a win-win situation for our partners. And one of the things I didn't mention in the prepared remarks is how many sort\nof repeat deals we do with existing partners.\nSo if you think of the number of deals we do with Biohaven or Cytokinetics or PTC or BioCryst over the years, there are a number of times where\nwe really try to create win-win situations and the partners come back to us for more capital. And so in the Syndax specific situation, you're correct\nthat there is a 2.35 cap. So basically, that -- once we were -- if we -- when we achieve a 2.35, that would end their obligations to us. But every deal\nis different. Many of our transactions are not cap transactions, most are not. And we just see a tremendous opportunity in that sector to continue\nto fund partners and new partners out there.\nOperator\nAsh Verma, UBS.\nAsh Verma - UBS - Analyst\nJust going back to Niktimvo. What are your thoughts on the IV administration and whether that becomes a bottleneck for adoption? Are these\nGvHD patients develop the disease effectively more than 100 days after the transplant? So majority of these patients don't necessarily need to visit\nthe hospital. So do you think that the deep penetration of orals will be an impediment for Niktimvo adoption?\nPablo Legorreta - Royalty Pharma PLC - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Thanks for the question. Marshall, why don't you take this.\nMarshall Urist - Royalty Pharma PLC - Executive Vice President - Research and Investments\nThanks for the question. So the core of the question is Niktimvo is IV administered. Some of the other options in the space are oral. And how will\nthat impact the launch? And so clearly, that was something that we thought a lot about and talked to physicians about. And I think the key takeaways\nwere, one, certainly, the fact that it's IV administered was reflected in our forecast and our expectations. I think second is that a lot of patients have\nalready experienced the options that are out there, and that was sort of the core of our view is that you have a significant number of patients who\nare still carrying a significant symptom burden and so are in need of further therapy.\nAnd so this is a serious condition. It can cause a pretty heavy symptom burden for patients. And so if you need another treatment, Niktimvo is going\nto be kind of the only option if you've been through steroids and Jakafi and Rezurock. So that's kind of the core of our view. And so that's how the\nIV administration was something that we thought about, but we're excited about the commercial opportunity there and given the unmet patient\nneed for patients who have failed other therapies.\nOperator\nI'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to Pablo Legorreta for any closing remarks.\nPablo Legorreta - Royalty Pharma PLC - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, operator, and thank you to everyone on the call for your continued interest in Royalty Pharma.

To assist in the financial modeling of\nits third quarter of 2024 results, the company has compiled the following items.\nPerformance Metrics and Non-GAAP Liquidity Measures\nPortfolio Receipts is a key performance metric that represents Royalty Pharma’s ability to generate cash\nfrom its portfolio investments, the primary source of capital for new portfolio investments. Portfolio\nReceipts includes Royalty Receipts and Milestones and other contractual receipts.\nRoyalty Pharma focuses on certain non-GAAP liquidity measures that represent sources of capital that\nare critical for investors to understand its business. These measures, presented as supplemental\nmeasures to GAAP financial information, include Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow.\nPrior-period results, details on selected royalty terms, as well as consensus sales estimates associated\nwith selected royalties are available for download on the Quarterly Results page of the company’s\nwebsite under Supplemental Financial Information (link here).\nThird Quarter 2023 Portfolio Receipts\nTable 1 provides historical Portfolio Receipts for the third quarter of 2023 and second quarter of 2024.\nTable 1 - Portfolio Receipts Highlights (unaudited)\n($ in millions) Third Quarter 2023 Second Quarter 2024\nProducts:\nCystic fibrosis franchise 196 195\nTysabri 71 64\nImbruvica 51 49\nTrelegy 58 48\nXtandi 39 39\nPromacta 45 30\nTremfya 27 30\nEvrysdi 16 25\nCabometyx/Cometriq 17 17\nTrodelvy 9 10\nSpinraza 15 10\nErleada 8 9\nOrladeyo 8 9\nNurtec ODT/Zavzpret 5 4\nOther products(5) 71 66\nRoyalty Receipts 637 605\nMilestones and other contractual receipts — 3\nPortfolio Receipts 637 608\nAmounts may not add due to rounding. For footnote references, see ‘Notes’ on page 8.\n1\nPortfolio Receipts\nPortfolio Receipts is defined as the sum of Royalty Receipts and Milestones and other contractual\nreceipts. Royalty Receipts includes variable payments based on sales of products, net of contractual\npayments to the legacy non-controlling interests, that are attributed to Royalty Pharma. Milestones and\nother contractual receipts include sales-based or regulatory milestones payments and other fixed\ncontractual receipts, net of contractual payments to the legacy non-controlling interests, that are\nattributed to Royalty Pharma.\n• Royalty Receipts generally lags product performance by one quarter. Royalty Receipts can be\nestimated by applying the company’s publicly disclosed royalty rates to the preceding quarter’s\nmarketer-announced net sales on a product-by-product basis and applying the percent\nattributable to Royalty Pharma (i.e. royalty net of the legacy non-controlling interests). Tables 2\nand 3 include reported net sales performance of selected approved products in the second\nquarter of 2024 and the royalty terms, where disclosed.\n• In instances where royalty rates are tiered, they typically reset at the beginning of the year and\nlower rates may apply in the earlier quarters of the year until pre-specified sales thresholds have\nbeen reached. As a result, royalty rates for certain products or franchises (such as the cystic\nfibrosis franchise and Promacta) have the potential to increase during the calendar year, with\nsecond quarter Royalty Receipts (reflecting first quarter sales) often including royalties on sales\nat the lowest royalty tier and first quarter Royalty Receipts (reflecting fourth quarter sales) often\nincluding royalties on sales at the highest royalty tier.\n• Additionally, whereas the majority of our royalties are paid quarterly, royalties on certain\nproducts are paid annually or semi-annually, which may affect the sequential growth of\nquarterly Portfolio Receipts. For example, the Entyvio and Soliqua royalties, which are recorded\nin Other products, are generally paid in the first and third quarters of the year.\nIn September 2024, Royalty Pharma acquired a royalty interest on U.S. net sales of Yorvipath from a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of Ascendis Pharma A/S for an upfront payment of $150 million. Royalties on\nYorvipath will be recorded in Portfolio Receipts following its U.S. launch, which is currently expected to\nbe in the first quarter of 2025 with a possibility of a launch in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nIn August 2024, Servier’s Voranigo (vorasidenib) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA). Royalties on Voranigo will be recorded in Royalty Receipts beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024\nbased on third quarter 2024 U.S. net sales.\nIn June 2024, PTC Therapeutics, Inc. exercised its option to sell half of its retained royalties on Roche’s\nEvrysdi to Royalty Pharma for approximately $242 million upfront. Royalty Pharma will receive the\nincreased royalty beginning in the third quarter of 2024 based on Evrysdi’s second quarter 2024 sales.\n2\nTable 2 - Net Sales Performance of Selected Approved Products – Second Quarter 2024 (unaudited)\nRevenues\nMarketers % Change Year/Year\n($ in millions) Second Quarter 2024\nProducts\nCystic fibrosis franchise Vertex 2,646 6\nTysabri Biogen 462 (4)\nImbruvica(1) AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson 1,120 (10)\nTrelegy(2) GSK 1,065 41\nXtandi(3) Pfizer, Astellas 1,439 29\nPromacta Novartis 544 (7)\nTremfya Johnson & Johnson 906 28\nEvrysdi(3) Roche 533 42\nCabometyx/Cometriq(4) Exelixis, Ipsen, Takeda 614 7\nTrodelvy Gilead 320 23\nSpinraza Biogen 429 (2)\nErleada Johnson & Johnson 736 30\nOrladeyo BioCryst 108 34\nNurtec ODT/Vydura Pfizer 356 44\nNotes:\n(1) Sales for Imbruvica include U.S. revenues reported by AbbVie and ex-U.S. revenues reported by Johnson & Johnson.\n(2) Trelegy revenues represent sales in U.S. dollars as reported by GSK.

There can be no assurances that our royalties will expire when estimated.\n(2) The royalties in our portfolio are subject to the underlying contractual agreements from which they arise and may be subject to reductions or\nother adjustments in accordance with the terms of such agreements. Royalty rates apply to annual worldwide net sales unless otherwise stated.\n(3) Ownership percentages for cystic fibrosis franchise, Erleada and Nurtec ODT/Zavzpret represent blended percentages across multiple royalty\ninterests based on 2023 Royalty Receipts.\n(4) Royalty is perpetual; year shown represents Trikafta’s expected patent expiration and potential sales decline based on timing of potential\ngeneric entry. For combination therapies, sales are allocated equally to each of the active pharmaceutical ingredients, with tiered royalties ranging\nfrom single digit to subteen percentages on sales of ivacaftor, lumacaftor and tezacaftor, and mid-single digit percentages on sales of elexacaftor.\n(5) We will pay Theravance Biopharma, Inc. 85% of the royalties in respect of ex-U.S. sales after June 30, 2029 and 85% of the royalties in respect\nof U.S. sales after December 31, 2030. Royalties are tiered based on sales at 6.5% up to $750 million, 8% between $750 million and $1.25 billion,\n9% between $1.25 billion and $2.25 billion, and 10% over $2.25 billion.\n(6) Royalties are tiered based on sales at 7.2% up to $500 million, 10% between $500 million and $1 billion, 12.7% between $1 billion and $2\nbillion, and 14.5% over $2 billion. Our royalty rates are expected to be reduced by 8% in the early 2030s. Royalty entitlement does not reflect PTC\nexercising the option to sell its remaining 9.5% of the Evrysdi royalty.\n(7) We are entitled to royalties on sales of cabozantinib products in the U.S. through September 2026 and non-U.S. markets through the full term\nof the royalty.\n(8) Our royalty interest in Spinraza will revert to Ionis after we receive aggregate Spinraza royalties equal to $475 million or $550 million,\ndepending on the timing and occurrence of certain events.

We are also entitled to a tiered percentage of sublicense revenue for Orladeyo in certain territories.\n4\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2024, Royalty Pharma had cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion and total debt with\nprincipal value of $7.8 billion. The weighted average duration of Royalty Pharma’s debt is approximately\n13 years with a weighted-average cost of 3.1%.\nIn June 2024, Royalty Pharma issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured notes (“2024 Notes”) with a\nweighted average coupon rate of 5.5%. Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears\non March 2 and September 2 of each year. The first interest payment date will be March 2, 2025. In\n2025, Royalty Pharma anticipates interest paid to be approximately $260 million.\nRoyalty Pharma began repurchasing its Class A ordinary shares in April 2023 under a $1.0 billion multi-\nyear share repurchase program. Year-to-date (through August 7, 2024), Royalty Pharma has\nrepurchased approximately four million Class A ordinary shares for $115 million. The weighted-average\nnumber of diluted Class A ordinary shares outstanding for the second quarter of 2024 was 597 million as\ncompared to 606 million for the second quarter of 2023.\nTable 4 – Liquidity Summary (unaudited)\n($ in millions) Third Quarter 2023 Second Quarter 2024\nPortfolio Receipts 637 608\nPayments for operating and professional costs (55) (48)\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) 582 560\nInterest (paid)/received, net (54) 14\nPortfolio Cash Flow (non-GAAP) 528 574\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are supplemental non-GAAP liquidity measures that are key\ncomponents of certain material covenants contained in Royalty Pharma’s credit agreement. Table 4\nprovides a summary of the non-GAAP liquidity measures and Table 5 provides a reconciliation of each\nnon-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure which is net cash provided\nby operating activities.\n• Adjusted EBITDA is calculated in accordance with the credit agreement as Portfolio Receipts\nminus payments for operating and professional costs. In the third quarter of 2023, payments for\noperating and professional costs were $55 million (which represented 9% of Portfolio Receipts).\n• Portfolio Cash Flow is calculated in accordance with the credit agreement as Adjusted EBITDA\nminus interest paid or received, net. This measure reflects the cash generated by Royalty\nPharma’s business that can be redeployed into value-enhancing royalty acquisitions, used to\nrepay debt, returned to shareholders through dividends or share purchases or utilized for other\ndiscretionary investments.\n• Net interest paid reflects the weighted average cost of borrowings on the company’s senior\nunsecured notes and interest received on the company’s cash balances. Based on the semi-\nannual interest payment schedule of Royalty Pharma’s outstanding notes, interest paid was $79\nmillion in the first quarter and is anticipated to be approximately $79 million in the third quarter\nof 2024, with a de minimis amount recorded in the second and fourth quarters of 2024,\nassuming no additional debt financing in the remainder of 2024, including no drawdown on the\n5\nrevolving credit facility. In the second quarter of 2024, Royalty Pharma received interest of $14\nmillion on its cash and cash equivalents, which partially offset interest paid.\nTable 5 – GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation (unaudited)\n($ in millions) Third Quarter 2023 Second Quarter 2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) 574 658\nAdjustments:\nProceeds from available for sale debt securities(6) — 3\nDistributions from equity method investees(6) 4 4\nInterest paid/(received), net(6) 54 (14)\nDevelopment-stage funding payments - ongoing 1 1\nDevelopment-stage funding payments - upfront and milestone 50 —\nDistributions to legacy non-controlling interests - Portfolio Receipts(6) (100) (92)\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) 582 560\nInterest (paid)/received, net(6) (54) 14\nPortfolio Cash Flow (non-GAAP) 528 574\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.

Capital Deployment was\n$951 million in the second quarter of 2024, consisting primarily of the acquisition of royalties on\nfrexalimab, the acquisition of additional royalties on Evrysdi, as well as the expanded strategic funding\ncollaboration with Cytokinetics. See Table 6 for Capital Deployment by category for the third quarter of\n2023 and second quarter of 2024.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Royalty Pharma also made an upfront payment of $905 million to Agios\nPharmaceuticals following the FDA approval of Voranigo and an upfront payment of $150 million to\nAscendis Pharma A/S to acquire a royalty interest on Yorvipath, which was approved by the FDA in\nAugust 2024 for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism in adults.\nTable 6 – Capital Deployment Details (unaudited)\n($ in millions) Third Quarter 2023 Second Quarter 2024\nAcquisitions of financial royalty assets (451) (729)\nDevelopment-stage funding payments - upfront and milestone (50) —\nDevelopment-stage funding payments - ongoing (1) (1)\nPurchases of available for sale debt securities — (150)\nMilestone payments — (50)\nInvestments in equity method investees (4) (4)\nAcquisitions of other financial assets — (18)\nContributions from legacy non-controlling interests - R&D 0 0\nCapital Deployment (506) (951)\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\n6\nPortfolio Receipts\nPortfolio Receipts is a key performance metric that represents our ability to generate cash from our\nportfolio investments, the primary source of capital that we can deploy to make new portfolio\ninvestments. Portfolio Receipts is defined as the sum of Royalty Receipts and Milestones and other\ncontractual receipts. Royalty Receipts includes variable payments based on sales of products, net of\ncontractual payments to the legacy non-controlling interests, that are attributed to Royalty Pharma.\nMilestones and other contractual receipts include sales-based or regulatory milestone payments and\nother fixed contractual receipts, net of contractual payments to legacy non-controlling interests, that\nare attributed to Royalty Pharma. Portfolio Receipts does not include proceeds from equity securities or\nproceeds from purchases and sales of marketable securities, neither of which are central to our\nfundamental business strategy.\nPortfolio Receipts is calculated as the sum of the following line items from our GAAP statements of cash\nflows: Cash collections from financial royalty assets, Cash collections from intangible royalty assets,\nOther royalty cash collections, Proceeds from available for sale debt securities and Distributions from\nequity method investees less Distributions to legacy non-controlling interests - Portfolio Receipts, which\nrepresent contractual distributions of Royalty Receipts, milestones and other contractual receipts to\nRPSFT and the Legacy Investors Partnerships.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are non-GAAP liquidity measures that exclude the impact of\ncertain items and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes\nthat Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are important non-GAAP measures used to analyze\nliquidity because they are key components of certain material covenants contained within Royalty\nPharma’s credit agreement. Royalty Pharma cautions readers that amounts presented in accordance\nwith the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow may not be the same as similar\nmeasures used by other companies or analysts. These non-GAAP liquidity measures have limitations as\nanalytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of\nRoyalty Pharma’s results as reported under GAAP.\nThe definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow used by Royalty Pharma are the same as the\ndefinitions in the credit agreement. Noncompliance with the interest coverage ratio, leverage ratio and\nPortfolio Cash Flow ratio covenants under the credit agreement could result in lenders requiring the\ncompany to immediately repay all amounts borrowed. If Royalty Pharma cannot satisfy these covenants,\nit would be prohibited under the credit agreement from engaging in certain activities, such as incurring\nadditional indebtedness, paying dividends, making certain payments, and acquiring and disposing of\nassets. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are critical to the assessment of Royalty\nPharma’s liquidity.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are used by management as key liquidity measures in the\nevaluation of the company’s ability to generate cash from operations. Management uses Adjusted\nEBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow when considering available cash, including for decision-making purposes\nrelated to funding of acquisitions, debt repayments, dividends and other discretionary investments.\nFurther, these non-GAAP liquidity measures help management, the audit committee and investors\nevaluate the company’s ability to generate liquidity from operating activities.\n7\nThe company has provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP liquidity measures to the most directly\ncomparable GAAP financial measure, being net cash provided by operating activities in Table 5.\nNotes\n(1) Portfolio Receipts is a key performance metric that represents our ability to generate cash from our portfolio investments,\nthe primary source of capital that we can deploy to make new portfolio investments. Portfolio Receipts is defined as the\nsum of Royalty Receipts and Milestones and other contractual receipts. Royalty Receipts includes variable payments based\non sales of products, net of contractual payments to the legacy non-controlling interests, that are attributed to Royalty\nPharma (“Royalty Receipts”). Milestones and other contractual receipts include sales-based or regulatory milestone\npayments and other fixed contractual receipts, net of contractual payments to the legacy non-controlling interests, that\nare attributed to Royalty Pharma. Portfolio Receipts does not include proceeds from equity securities or marketable\nsecurities, both of which are not central to our fundamental business strategy.\nPortfolio Receipts is calculated as the sum of the following line items from our GAAP statements of cash flows: Cash\ncollections from financial royalty assets, Cash collections from intangible royalty assets, Other royalty cash collections,\nProceeds from available for sale debt securities and Distributions from equity method investees less Distributions to legacy\nnon-controlling interests - Portfolio Receipts, which represent contractual distributions of Royalty Receipts, milestones and\nother contractual receipts to RPSFT and the Legacy Investors Partnerships.\n(2) Adjusted EBITDA is defined under the credit agreement as Portfolio Receipts minus payments for operating and\nprofessional costs. Operating and professional costs reflect Payments for operating and professional costs from the GAAP\nstatements of cash flows. See GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation in Table 5.\n(3) Portfolio Cash Flow is defined under the credit agreement as Adjusted EBITDA minus interest paid or received, net. See\nGAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation in Table 5. Portfolio Cash Flow reflects the cash generated by Royalty Pharma’s business\nthat can be redeployed into value-enhancing royalty acquisitions, used to repay debt, returned to shareholders through\ndividends or share purchases or utilized for other discretionary investments.\n(4) Capital Deployment is calculated as the summation of the following line items from our GAAP statements of cash flows:\nInvestments in equity method investees, Purchases of available for sale debt securities, Acquisitions of financial royalty\nassets, Acquisitions of other financial assets, Milestone payments, Development-stage funding payments - ongoing,\nDevelopment-stage funding payments - upfront and milestone less Contributions from legacy non-controlling interests -\nR&D.\n(5) Other products primarily include Royalty Receipts on the following products: Cimzia, Crysvita, Emgality, Farxiga/Onglyza,\nIDHIFA, Nesina, Prevymis, Soliqua and distributions from the Legacy SLP Interest, which is presented as Distributions from\nequity method investees on the GAAP statements of cash flows.\n(6) The table below shows the line item for each adjustment and the direct location for such line item on the GAAP\nstatements of cash flows.\nReconciling Adjustment Statements of Cash Flows Classification\nInterest paid/(received), net Operating activities (Interest paid less Interest received)\nDistributions from equity method investees Investing activities\nProceeds from available for sale debt securities Investing activities\nDistributions to legacy non-controlling interests - Portfolio\nFinancing activities\nReceipts\n8\nAbout Royalty Pharma plc\nFounded in 1996, Royalty Pharma is the largest buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties and a leading\nfunder of innovation across the biopharmaceutical industry, collaborating with innovators from\nacademic institutions, research hospitals and non-profits through small and mid-cap biotechnology\ncompanies to leading global pharmaceutical companies.

The prize includes a $250,000 charitable donation to support medical research or educational initiatives that further the recipient’s work.\n\n“I am delighted to award the inaugural Royalty Pharma Prize for Impact in Healthcare to Michael Milken” said Pablo Legorreta, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Royalty Pharma. “Mike has made a tremendous global impact in the fields of medical research and public health through his work at the Milken institute, Faster Cures and the Prostate Cancer Foundation.”\n\nMichael Milken is the founder and chairman of the Milken Institute, an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan economic think tank that publishes research and hosts conferences that apply market-based principles and financial innovations to social issues in the US and internationally. Mr. Milken is also the founder of the Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF). Since its inception in 1993, the PCF has raised over $1 billion to support prostate cancer research with funding allocated to more than 2,240 research projects across 245 leading cancer centers in 28 countries. Notably, the PCF has been instrumental in the approval of six new drugs by the FDA for advanced prostate cancer, improving patients’ quality of life and contributing to the decline in prostate cancer mortality rates over the past two decades.\n\nRoyalty Pharma focuses its philanthropy on non-profit institutions and initiatives that enable innovation in life sciences, reduce the risk of disease, and strengthen and ensure equal access to healthcare. In 2022, Royalty Pharma announced a charitable contribution to Icahn Mount Sinai’s Institute for Health Equity Research (IHER) and the creation of the Mount Sinai-Royalty Pharma Alliance for Health Equity Research to support IHER in its ongoing efforts to close the health care disparity gap and translate discoveries into sustainable, scalable initiatives and policies that break down systemic barriers to care among communities in New York City, nationally and globally. Additionally, Royalty Pharma is a founding corporate partner of Life Science Cares New York, which fights poverty and inequity in the city through education. Royalty Pharma has also made charitable contributions to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, a global leader in the fight against blood cancer.\n\n**About Royalty Pharma plc**\n\nFounded in 1996, Royalty Pharma is the largest buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties and a leading funder of innovation across the biopharmaceutical industry, collaborating with innovators from academic institutions, research hospitals and non-profits through small and mid-cap biotechnology companies to leading global pharmaceutical companies.

Additionally, The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines were updated to include imetelstat as a Category 1 and 2A treatment of symptomatic anemia in patients with LR-MDS. Geron is currently enrolling a Phase 3 trial of imetelstat in myelofibrosis patients who are relapsed/refractory to JAK-inhibitors.\n\n“RYTELO is an important therapy for the lower-risk MDS patient population, who otherwise have limited treatment options, and we look forward to its development in other hematologic malignancy indications. We are delighted to establish this partnership with Geron to help fuel their execution of significant commercial and development opportunities ahead” said Pablo Legorreta, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Royalty Pharma.\n\n“The significant financial commitment from an exceptional long-term partner like Royalty Pharma strengthens our cash position and further solidifies our balance sheet, while providing flexibility to invest in our future” said John Scarlett, Geron’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We believe that the terms reflect the significant commercial potential of RYTELO.”\n\nRoyalty Pharma has provided $125 million at closing and will receive tiered royalty payments on U.S. net sales of RYTELO, ranging from 7.75% of annual net sales up to $500 million, 3.0% of annual net sales between $500 million and $1 billion, and 1.0% of annual net sales over $1 billion. Payments to Royalty Pharma will cease if the aggregate royalties payable through June 30, 2031 reach a multiple of 1.65 its investment, otherwise the royalty payments will continue until Royalty Pharma receives a multiple of 2.0 its investment.\n\n**Advisors**\n\nTD Cowen served as financial advisor and Cooley LLP served as legal advisor to Geron. Goodwin Procter and Fenwick & West LLP served as legal advisors to Royalty Pharma.\n\n**About Royalty Pharma plc**\n\nFounded in 1996, Royalty Pharma is the largest buyer of biopharmaceutical royalties and a leading funder of innovation across the biopharmaceutical industry, collaborating with innovators from academic institutions, research hospitals and non-profits through small and mid-cap biotechnology companies to leading global pharmaceutical companies.

In September 2024, Exelixis announced final results from the Phase 3 pivotal CONTACT-02 study, which achieved one of two primary endpoints, demonstrating a statistically significant benefit in progression-free survival, and a numerical but not statistically significant improvement in overall survival for cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Exelixis intends to submit a supplemental NDA with the FDA later this year.  \n**Tremfya** | In September 2024, Johnson and Johnson announced the FDA approval of Tremfya for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.  \n**Spinraza** | In September 2024, Biogen announced the pivotal cohort (Part B) of the Phase 2/3 DEVOTE study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a higher dose regimen of Spinraza in infants with spinal muscular atrophy met its primary endpoint, achieving a statistically significant improvement in motor function compared to a prespecified matched sham control group.  \n**Voranigo (vorasidenib)** | In August 2024, Servier announced the FDA approval of Voranigo, a first-in-class targeted therapy for patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) mutant diffuse glioma.  \n**BCX10013** | In August 2024, BioCryst announced that it plans to discontinue development of its oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX10013, as the level of clinical activity observed was less than other therapies on the market.  \n  \n**2024 Financial Outlook**\n\nRoyalty Pharma has provided guidance for full year 2024, **excluding** new transactions and borrowings announced after the date of this release, as follows:\n\n**Provided November 6, 2024** | **Previous**  \n---|---  \n**Portfolio Receipts** | $2,750 million to $2,800 million | $2,700 million to $2,775 million  \n**Payments for operating and professional costs** | ~8.5% of Portfolio Receipts | 8% to 9% of Portfolio Receipts  \n**Interest paid** | $160 million | $160 million  \n  \nThe above Portfolio Receipts guidance includes expected Royalty Receipts growth of 11% to 13% in 2024. Royalty Pharma’s full-year 2024 guidance reflects a negligible estimated foreign exchange impact to Portfolio Receipts, assuming current foreign exchange rates prevail for the rest of 2024.\n\nTotal interest paid is based on the semi-annual interest payment schedule of Royalty Pharma’s existing notes and is anticipated to be approximately $160 million in 2024. Interest paid is anticipated to be a _de minimis_ amount in the fourth quarter of 2024. The projection assumes no additional debt financing in 2024, including no drawdown on the revolving credit facility. In the third quarter of 2024, Royalty Pharma collected interest of $17 million on its cash and cash equivalents. In 2025, Royalty Pharma anticipates interest paid to be approximately $260 million, including interest payments on the $1.5 billion notes issued in June 2024.\n\nRoyalty Pharma today provides this guidance based on its most up-to-date view of its prospects. This guidance assumes no major unforeseen adverse events or changes in foreign exchange rates and excludes the contributions from transactions announced subsequent to the date of this press release.\n\n**Financial Results Call**\n\nRoyalty Pharma will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast to discuss its third quarter 2024 results today at 8:30 a.m., Eastern Time.

Royalty Pharma has assembled a portfolio of royalties which entitles it to payments based directly on the top-line sales of many of the industry’s leading therapies. Royalty Pharma funds innovation in the biopharmaceutical industry both directly and indirectly – directly when it partners with companies to co-fund late-stage clinical trials and new product launches in exchange for future royalties, and indirectly when it acquires existing royalties from the original innovators. Royalty Pharma’s current portfolio includes royalties on more than 35 commercial products, including Vertex’s Trikafta, GSK’s Trelegy, Roche’s Evrysdi, Johnson & Johnson’s Tremfya, Biogen’s Tysabri and Spinraza, AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson’s Imbruvica, Astellas and Pfizer’s Xtandi, Novartis’ Promacta, Pfizer’s Nurtec ODT and Gilead’s Trodelvy, and 15 development-stage product candidates.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThe information set forth herein does not purport to be complete or to contain all of the information you may desire.

Portfolio Receipts is defined as the sum of Royalty Receipts and Milestones and other contractual receipts. Royalty Receipts includes variable payments based on sales of products, net of contractual payments to the legacy non-controlling interests, that are attributed to Royalty Pharma.\n\nMilestones and other contractual receipts include sales-based or regulatory milestone payments and other fixed contractual receipts, net of contractual payments to legacy non-controlling interests, that are attributed to Royalty Pharma. Portfolio Receipts does not include proceeds from equity securities or proceeds from purchases and sales of marketable securities, neither of which are central to our fundamental business strategy.\n\nPortfolio Receipts is calculated as the sum of the following line items from our GAAP statements of cash flows: _Cash collections from financial royalty assets_ , _Cash collections from intangible royalty assets_ , _Other royalty cash collections_ , _Proceeds from available for sale debt securities_ and _Distributions from equity method investees_ less _Distributions to legacy non-controlling interests – Portfolio Receipts_ , which represent contractual distributions of Royalty Receipts, milestones and other contractual receipts to RPSFT and the Legacy Investors Partnerships.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are non-GAAP liquidity measures that exclude the impact of certain items and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are important non-GAAP measures used to analyze liquidity because they are key components of certain material covenants contained within Royalty Pharma’s credit agreement. Royalty Pharma cautions readers that amounts presented in accordance with the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies or analysts. These non-GAAP liquidity measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of Royalty Pharma’s results as reported under GAAP.\n\nThe definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow used by Royalty Pharma are the same as the definitions in the credit agreement. Noncompliance with the interest coverage ratio, leverage ratio and Portfolio Cash Flow ratio covenants under the credit agreement could result in lenders requiring the company to immediately repay all amounts borrowed. If Royalty Pharma cannot satisfy these covenants, it would be prohibited under the credit agreement from engaging in certain activities, such as incurring additional indebtedness, paying dividends, making certain payments, and acquiring and disposing of assets. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are critical to the assessment of Royalty Pharma’s liquidity.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow are used by management as key liquidity measures in the evaluation of the company’s ability to generate cash from operations. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Portfolio Cash Flow when considering available cash, including for decision-making purposes related to funding of acquisitions, debt repayments, dividends and other discretionary investments. Further, these non-GAAP liquidity measures help management, the audit committee and investors evaluate the company’s ability to generate liquidity from operating activities.\n\nThe company has provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP liquidity measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, being net cash provided by operating activities in Table 4.\n\n**Royalty Pharma

Portfolio Receipts is a key performance metric that represents our ability to generate cash from our portfolio investments, the primary source of capital that we can deploy to make new portfolio investments. Portfolio Receipts is defined as the sum of Royalty Receipts and Milestones and other contractual receipts. Royalty Receipts includes variable payments based on sales of products, net of contractual payments to the legacy non-controlling interests, that are attributed to Royalty Pharma (“Royalty Receipts”). Milestones and other contractual receipts include sales-based or regulatory milestone payments and other fixed contractual receipts, net of contractual payments to the legacy non-controlling interests, that are attributed to Royalty Pharma.\n\nPortfolio Receipts does not include proceeds from equity securities or marketable securities, both of which are not central to our fundamental business strategy. Portfolio Receipts is calculated as the sum of the following line items from our GAAP statements of cash flows: _Cash collections from financial royalty assets_ ,_Cash collections from intangible royalty assets_ , _Other royalty cash collections_ , _Proceeds from available for sale debt securities_ and _Distributions from equity method investees_ less _Distributions to legacy non-controlling interests – Portfolio Receipts_ , which represent contractual distributions of Royalty Receipts, milestones and other contractual receipts to RPSFT and the Legacy Investors Partnerships.\n\n(2) Adjusted EBITDA is defined under the credit agreement as Portfolio Receipts minus payments for operating and professional costs. Operating and professional costs reflect _Payments for operating and professional costs_ from the GAAP statements of cash flows. See GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation in Table 4.\n\n(3) Portfolio Cash Flow is defined under the credit agreement as Adjusted EBITDA minus interest paid or received, net. See GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliation in Table 4. Portfolio Cash Flow reflects the cash generated by Royalty Pharma’s business that can be redeployed into value-enhancing royalty acquisitions, used to repay debt, returned to shareholders through dividends or share purchases or utilized for other discretionary investments.\n\n(4) Capital Deployment is calculated as the summation of the following line items from our GAAP statements of cash flows: _Investments in equity method investees, Purchases of available for sale debt securities, Acquisitions of financial royalty assets, Acquisitions of other financial assets, Milestone payments, Development-stage funding payments – ongoing, Development-stage funding payments – upfront and milestone_ less C _ontributions from legacy non-controlling interests – R &D_.\n\n(5) Other products primarily include Royalty Receipts on the following products: Cimzia, Crysvita, Emgality, Entyvio, Farxiga/Onglyza, IDHIFA, Letairis, Nesina, Prevymis, Soliqua and distributions from the Legacy SLP Interest, which is presented as _Distributions from equity method investees_ on the GAAP statements of cash flows.\n\n(6) The table below shows the line item for each adjustment and the direct location for such line item on the GAAP statements of cash flows.\n\n**Reconciling Adjustment** | **Statements of Cash Flows Classification**  \n---|---  \nInterest paid, net | Operating activities _(Interest paid_ less _Interest received_)  \n_Distributions from equity method investees_ | Investing activities  \n_Proceeds from available for sale debt securities_ | Investing activities  \n_Distributions to legacy non-controlling interests – Portfolio Receipts_ | Financing activities  \n  \n![](https://www.royaltypharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/stay-up-to-date-footer-wallpaper-e1704384839155.jpg)\n\n## Stay up to date\n\nSubscribe to Royalty Pharma news and alerts\n\n[Subscribe](/investors/contact-us/#subscribe)\n\n![Cookiebot session tracker icon loaded](https://imgsct.cookiebot.com/1.gif?dgi=39808ea7-9911-4628-b461-13b4211a6859)\n"
