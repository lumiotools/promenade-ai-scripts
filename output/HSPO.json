The following tables show these distributions, payable as set forth in the tables below, total $0.33 per share. Since its 2010 initial public offering, Horizon has paid a total of $286 million in distributions to its shareholders. \n\n**Monthly Distributions Declared in Fourth Quarter 2024**\n\nEx-Dividend Date  |  Record Date  |  Payment Date  |  Amount per Share   \n---|---|---|---  \nDecember 16, 2024 |  December 16, 2024 |  January 15, 2025 |  $0.11  \nJanuary 16, 2025 |  January 16, 2025 |  February 14, 2025 |  $0.11  \nFebruary 18, 2025 |  February 18, 2025 |  March 14, 2025 |  $0.11  \nTotal:  |  $0.33  \n  \nWhen declaring distributions, Horizon’s board of directors reviews estimates of taxable income available for distribution, which may differ from consolidated net income under generally accepted accounting principles due to (i) changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation, (ii) temporary and permanent differences in income and expense recognition, and (iii) the amount of spillover income carried over from a given year for distribution in the following year. The final determination of taxable income for each tax year, as well as the tax attributes for distributions in such tax year, will be made after the close of the tax year. \n\nHorizon maintains a “Dividend Reinvestment Plan” (“DRIP”) that provides for the reinvestment of distributions on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder has elected to receive distributions in cash. As a result, if Horizon declares a distribution, its stockholders who have not “opted out” of the DRIP by the distribution record date will have their distribution automatically reinvested into additional shares of Horizon’s common stock. Horizon has the option to satisfy the share requirements of the DRIP through the issuance of new shares of common stock or through open market purchases of common stock by the DRIP plan administrator. Newly-issued shares will be valued based upon the final closing price of Horizon’s common stock on a specified valuation date for each distribution as determined by Horizon’s board of directors. Shares purchased in the open market to satisfy the DRIP requirements will be valued based upon the average price of the applicable shares purchased by the DRIP plan administrator, before any associated brokerage or other costs, which are borne by Horizon. \n\n**About Horizon Technology Finance**\n\nHorizon Technology Finance Corporation (NASDAQ: HRZN), externally managed by Horizon Technology Finance Management LLC, an affiliate of Monroe Capital, is a leading specialty finance company that provides capital in the form of secured loans to venture capital backed companies in the technology, life science, healthcare information and services, and sustainability industries.

Pomeroy, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Horizon. “Our net investment income for the quarter was just one cent below our distributions for the quarter, as we grew our portfolio with quality investments to ensure that our portfolio will generate net investment income to cover our distributions over time.” \n\n“We also further strengthened our balance sheet, raising over $18 million through our ATM program in the quarter and, subsequent to the end of the quarter, completing a private $20 million convertible notes offering, both of which provide us with additional capital to execute on additional originations,” added Mr. Pomeroy. “Looking forward, we expect to grow our portfolio through high-quality investments, while we focus on maximizing the value of our existing investments.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Operating Results**\n\nTotal investment income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $24.6 million, compared to $29.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower interest income on investments from the debt investment portfolio. \n\nThe Company’s dollar-weighted annualized yield on average debt investments for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 15.9% and 17.1%, respectively. The Company calculates the dollar-weighted annualized yield on average debt investments for any period measured as (1) total investment income (excluding dividend income) during the period divided by (2) the average of the fair value of debt investments outstanding on (a) the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the first day of the period and (b) the last day of each calendar month during the period. The dollar-weighted annualized yield on average debt investments is higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect expenses or any sales load paid by investors. \n\nTotal expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $12.4 million, compared to $11.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

Michaud, President of Horizon and HTFM. “For the quarter, we originated $93.1 million of loans, as our venture debt portfolio returned to meaningful growth. We also significantly increased our committed backlog to $189.9 million of debt investments, providing Horizon with a solid foundation for future lending opportunities. We continue to believe Horizon remains well positioned to deliver additional value to its shareholders.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Portfolio Update**\n\n**Originations**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, HRZN funded a total of $93.1 million of loans, as follows: \n\n  * $25.0 million to a new portfolio company, Hometeam Technologies, Inc. (dba Vesta Healthcare), a tech-enabled clinical services company that integrates caregivers, patients and the healthcare delivery system to monitor chronic conditions of high-risk patients. \n  * $16.0 million to an existing portfolio company, Spineology, Inc., a developer of anatomy-conserving technology solutions for use in lumbar spinal fusion procedures. \n  * $15.0 million to a new portfolio company, GT Medical Technologies, Inc., a developer of a proprietary solution to treat brain tumors. \n  * $15.0 million to a new portfolio company, Infobionic, Inc., a developer of an FDA-cleared SaaS remote monitoring system to help treat cardiac arrythmia. \n  * $10.0 million to a new portfolio company, Pivot Bio, Inc., a developer of natural microbial products that ensure crops receive essential nitrogen needed to grow. \n  * $10.0 million to a new portfolio company, a developer of a connected digital supply chain for custom manufacturing that networks highly-vetted manufacturing partners around the globe. \n  * $1.0 million to an existing portfolio company, Swift Health Systems, Inc.

(“MyForest Foods”) prepaid its outstanding principal balance of $3.8 million on its venture loan, plus interest, end-of-term payment and prepayment fee. HRZN continues to hold warrants in MyForest Foods. \n  * In July, Lemongrass Holdings, Inc. (“Lemongrass”) prepaid its outstanding principal balance of $6.2 million on its venture loan, plus interest, end-of-term payment and prepayment fee. HRZN continues to hold warrants in Lemongrass. \n  * In July, Slingshot Aerospace, Inc. (“Slingshot Aerospace”) prepaid its outstanding principal balance of $20.0 million on its venture loan, plus interest, end-of-term payment and prepayment fee. HRZN continues to hold warrants in Slingshot Aerospace. \n  * In July, with the proceeds of a new loan from the Horizon Platform, Spineology paid its outstanding principal balance of $7.5 million on its venture loan, plus interest and end-of-term payment. HRZN continues to hold warrants in Spineology. \n\n\n\nHRZN also received prepayments of principal from two portfolio companies in the aggregate amount of $1.8 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to $11.4 million of prepayments of principal during the second quarter of 2024. \n\n**Principal Payments Received**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, HRZN received regularly scheduled principal payments on investments totaling $12.4 million, compared to regularly scheduled principal payments totaling $11.8 million during the second quarter of 2024. \n\n**Commitments**\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, HRZN closed new loan commitments totaling $172.9 million to eight companies, compared to new loan commitments of $12.5 million to two companies in the second quarter of 2024. \n\n**Pipeline and Term Sheets**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, HRZN’s unfunded loan approvals and commitments (“Committed Backlog”) were $189.9 million to 16 companies. This compares to a Committed Backlog of $137.5 million to 13 companies at HRZN as of June 30, 2024. HRZN’s portfolio companies have discretion whether to draw down such commitments and the right of a portfolio company to draw down its commitment is often subject to achievement of specific milestones and other conditions to borrowing. Accordingly, there is no assurance that any or all of these transactions will be funded by HRZN. \n\nDuring the quarter, HTFM received signed term sheets that are in the approval process, which may result in the Horizon Platform providing up to an aggregate of $35.0 million of new debt investments. These opportunities are subject to underwriting conditions including, but not limited to, the completion of due diligence, negotiation of definitive documentation and investment committee approval, as well as compliance with HTFM’s allocation policy. Accordingly, there is no assurance that any or all of these transactions will be completed or funded by HRZN. \n\n**Warrant and Equity Portfolio**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, HRZN held a portfolio of warrant and equity positions in 103 portfolio companies, including 92 private companies, which provides the potential for future additional returns to HRZN’s shareholders. \n\n**About Horizon Technology Finance**\n\nHorizon Technology Finance Corporation (NASDAQ: HRZN), externally managed by Horizon Technology Finance Management LLC, an affiliate of Monroe Capital, is a leading specialty finance company that provides capital in the form of secured loans to venture capital backed companies in the technology, life science, healthcare information and services, and sustainability industries.

Pomeroy, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Horizon. “Our net investment income for the quarter was just one cent below our distributions for the quarter, as we grew our portfolio with quality investments to ensure that our portfolio will generate net investment income to cover our distributions over time.” \n\n“We also further strengthened our balance sheet, raising over $18 million through our ATM program in the quarter and, subsequent to the end of the quarter, completing a private $20 million convertible notes offering, both of which provide us with additional capital to execute on additional originations,” added Mr. Pomeroy. “Looking forward, we expect to grow our portfolio through high-quality investments, while we focus on maximizing the value of our existing investments.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Operating Results**\n\nTotal investment income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $24.6 million, compared to $29.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower interest income on investments from the debt investment portfolio. \n\nThe Company’s dollar-weighted annualized yield on average debt investments for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 15.9% and 17.1%, respectively. The Company calculates the dollar-weighted annualized yield on average debt investments for any period measured as (1) total investment income (excluding dividend income) during the period divided by (2) the average of the fair value of debt investments outstanding on (a) the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the first day of the period and (b) the last day of each calendar month during the period. The dollar-weighted annualized yield on average debt investments is higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect expenses or any sales load paid by investors. \n\nTotal expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $12.4 million, compared to $11.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in interest expense. \n\nNet investment income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $11.8 million, or $0.32 per share, compared to $17.4 million, or $0.53 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. \n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, net realized loss on investments was $33.9 million, or $0.93 per share, compared to net realized loss on investments of $11.8 million, or $0.36 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. \n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, net unrealized appreciation on investments was $29.3 million, or $0.80 per share, compared to net unrealized depreciation on investments of $17.5 million, or $0.54 per share, for the prior-year period. \n\n**Portfolio Summary and Investment Activity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s debt portfolio consisted of 53 secured loans with an aggregate fair value of $633.3 million. In addition, the Company’s total warrant, equity and other investments in 108 portfolio companies had an aggregate fair value of $50.7 million. Total portfolio investment activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows: \n\n_($ in thousands)_ |  **For the Three Months Ended** **September 30 ,** |  **For the Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nBeginning portfolio  |  $  |  646,862  |  $  |  715,391  |  $  |  709,085  |  $  |  720,026   \nNew debt and equity investments  |  94,117  |  89,435  |  140,751  |  186,988   \nLess refinanced debt balances  |  (8,290  |  )  |  (22,500  |  )  |  (19,540  |  )  |  (32,500  |  )   \nNet new debt and equity investments  |  85,827  |  66,935  |  121,211  |  154,488   \nPrincipal payments received on investments  |  (12,502  |  )  |  (9,121  |  )  |  (34,805  |  )  |  (22,011  |  )   \nEarly pay-offs and principal paydowns  |  (31,890  |  )  |  (16,605  |  )  |  (85,643  |  )  |  (68,211  |  )   \nPayment-in-kind interest on investments  |  379  |  3,934  |  2,114  |  6,088   \nAccretion of debt investment fees  |  1,474  |  1,925  |  4,470  |  5,018   \nNew debt investment fees  |  (1,522  |  )  |  (1,595  |  )  |  (2,089  |  )  |  (2,397  |  )   \nWarrants and equity received in settlement of fee income  |  —  |  80  |  359  |  169   \nProceeds from sale of investments  |  (69  |  )  |  (2,557  |  )  |  (157  |  )  |  (11,063  |  )   \nNet realized loss on investments  |  (33,894  |  )  |  (11,816  |  )  |  (31,422  |  )  |  (28,513  |  )   \nNet unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments  |  29,335  |  (17,518  |  )  |  864  |  (24,448  |  )   \nOther  |  —  |  —  |  13  |  (93  |  )   \nEnding portfolio  |  $  |  684,000  |  $  |  729,053  |  $  |  684,000  |  $  |  729,053   \n  \n**Portfolio Asset Quality**\n\nThe following table shows the classification of Horizon’s loan portfolio at fair value by internal credit rating as of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: \n\n_($ in thousands)_ |  **September 30, 2024** |  **June 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Number of Investments** |  **Debt Investments at Fair Value** |  **Percentage of Debt Investments** |  **Number of Investments** |  **Debt Investments at Fair Value** |  **Percentage of Debt Investments** |  **Number of Investments** |  **Debt Investments at Fair Value** |  **Percentage of Debt Investments**  \n**Credit Rating**  \n4  |  10  |  $  |  129,508  |  20.5%  |  13  |  $  |  167,758  |  27.5%  |  11  |  $  |  150,367  |  22.4%   \n3  |  34  |  449,085  |  70.9%  |  32  |  366,945  |  60.3%  |  39  |  452,911  |  67.6%   \n2  |  6  |  33,465  |  5.3%  |  4  |  26,336  |  4.3%  |  2  |  39,343  |  5.9%   \n1  |  3  |  21,226  |  3.3%  |  5  |  48,029  |  7.9%  |  4  |  27,551  |  4.1%   \nTotal  |  53  |  $  |  633,284  |  100.0%  |  54  |  $  |  609,068  |  100.0%  |  56  |  $  |  670,172  |  100.0%   \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Horizon’s loan portfolio had a weighted average credit rating of 3.1, with 4 being the highest credit quality rating and 3 being the rating for a standard level of risk. A rating of 2 represents an increased level of risk and, while no loss is currently anticipated for a 2-rated loan, there is potential for future loss of principal. A rating of 1 represents deteriorating credit quality and high degree of risk of loss of principal. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were three debt investments with an internal credit rating of 1, with an aggregate cost of $36.5 million and an aggregate fair value of $21.2 million.

The Key Facility allows for an increase in the total loan commitment up to an aggregate commitment of $300.0 million. There can be no assurance that any additional lenders will make any commitments under the Key Facility. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $181.0 million in outstanding principal balance under the $250 million senior secured debt facility with a large U.S.-based insurance company at an interest rate of 6.43%. \n\nAdditionally, as of September 30, 2024, there was $50.0 million in outstanding principal balance under the $100 million senior secured credit facility with a large U.S.-based insurance company at an interest rate of 7.38%. \n\nHorizon Funding Trust 2022-1, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Horizon, previously issued $100.0 million of Asset-Backed Notes (the “2022 Notes”) rated A by a ratings agency.
