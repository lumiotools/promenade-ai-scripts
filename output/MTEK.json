General\nA. Introduction\nMaris-Tech Ltd. (the Company) was incorporated in 2008, in Israel. The Company develops, designs and manufactures high-end digital video\nand audio products and solutions for the professional as well as the civilian and home security markets, which can be sold off the shelf or fully\ncustomized to meet customers requirements.\nOn February 4, 2022, the Company closed an initial public offering (IPO). In connection with the IPO (including over-allotment and exercise of\npre-funded warrants issued and sold in the IPO), the Company issued and sold 4,244,048 ordinary shares, no par value per share (Ordinary\nShares), and warrants (Warrants) to purchase up to 4,244,048 Ordinary Shares. The Ordinary Shares and Warrants were approved for listing on\nthe Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq) and commenced trading under the symbol MTEK and MTEKW, respectively, on February 2, 2022.\nFor further information see Note 12.\nThe Company operates in Israel and sells to customers in other countries, including the United States, United Kingdom and Switzerland.\nB. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and has relied on its ability to fund its\noperations primarily through proceeds from sales of Ordinary Shares, preferred shares no par value per share (Preferred Shares), warrants, credit\nlines and long-term loans from banks and shareholders. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had working capital of $10.4 million\nand a working capital deficit of $1 million, respectively, an accumulated deficit of $8.2 million and $4.5 million, respectively, and negative cash\nflow from operating activity of $4.9 million and $0.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The\nCompany anticipates such losses will continue until its products reach commercial profitability.\nOn February 4, 2022, in connection with the IPO (including over-allotment and exercise of pre-funded warrants issued and sold in the IPO), the\nCompany issued and sold 4,244,048 Ordinary Shares and Warrants to purchase up to 4,244,048 Ordinary Shares (and received aggregate gross\nproceeds of $17.8 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and before offering expenses ($15.1 million net proceeds\nafter deducting approximately $1.35 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately $1.35 million of other offering costs).\nDuring February and May 2022, the Company repaid its liabilities to banks and one of the Companys shareholders, Yaad Consulting and\nManagement Services (1995) Ltd. (Yaad), in the total amount of approximately $1.4 million. As a result, personal guarantees, debenture and\ncollateral securing certain of those loans were released.\nTherefore, based on managements projections of the business results for the next twelve months, management concluded that the Company has\nsufficient liquidity to satisfy its obligations over the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements.\nF-7\nf20f2022_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 113\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 03/06/2023 07:52 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n(U.S. dollars)\nNote 1  General (Continued)\nIn connection with the outbreak of COVID-19, the Company has taken steps to protect its workforce in Israel. Such steps include work from home\nwhere possible, minimizing face-to-face meetings and utilizing video conference as much as possible, social distancing at facilities and elimination\nof all international travel. The Company continues to comply with all local health directives.\nAnother impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been on product delivery, where the lead time to procure component parts is longer and a shortage\nin supply of component parts has increased as the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic has continued. As long as the COVID-19 pandemic\ncontinues, the lead time to obtain component parts may be longer than normal and shortage in supply of component parts may continue or worsen.\nTherefore, the Company maintains a comprehensive network of world-wide suppliers. In addition, in cases where certain components are\npurchased from single source manufacturers, the Company has adjusted and modified its designs based on different components from different\nsuppliers, to allow for more versatility and flexibility.\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.\nGAAP).\nThe significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements, applied on a consistent basis, except as noted in Note\n2W for the change in the manner in which the Company accounts for leases, are as follows:\nA. Functional Currency\nMost of the Companys revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. A main portion of purchases of materials, component parts and sales costs are\ndenominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, both the functional and reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar.\nTransactions and balances denominated in U.S. dollars are presented at their original amounts.\nMonetary balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S dollar are converted into U.S dollars in accordance with Statements of the\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters. All transaction gain and losses of the converted monetary\nbalance sheet items are reflected in the statements of operations, among financial expenses, net, as appropriate.\nB. Estimates and assumptions\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenues and expenses during reported period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. As applicable for these financial\nstatements, the most significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition, and valuation of inventories.\nF-8\nf20f2022_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 114\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 03/06/2023 07:52 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n(U.S. dollars)\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nC. Cash equivalents\nCash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments and debt instruments that are readily convertible to cash with original maturities of three\nmonths or less from the date of purchase.\nD. Bank deposits\nBank deposits with original maturities of more than three months, or specific deposits that are intended to be held as bank deposits for more than\nthree months, and which will mature within one year, are classified as short-term investments.\nE. Trade receivables\nTrade receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The financial statements include an allowance for doubtful\naccounts for which collection of the receivable is not probable and as of December 31, 2022, the provision for allowance for doubtful accounts was\nnegligible. In determining the adequacy of the allowance, consideration is given to each trade receivable historical experience, aging of the\nreceivable, adjusted to take into account current market conditions and information available about specific debtors, including their financial\ncondition, current payment patterns, the volume of their operations, and evaluation of the security received from them or their guarantors.\nF. Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by calculating raw materials, work in process and finished\nproducts on a weighted average cost basis. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less\nreasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Inventory write-offs are provided to cover risks arising from slow moving\nitems or technological obsolescence. Such write-offs have been included in cost of revenues. Reserves for potentially excess and obsolete\ninventory are made based on managements analysis of inventory levels, future sales forecasts. Once established, the original cost of inventory less\nthe related inventory reserve represents the new cost basis of such products.\nG. Property, plant and equipment, net\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\nYears\nComputers and manufacturing equipment 3-7\nOffice furniture and equipment 17\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of economic life\nor lease term\nH. Revenue recognition\nThe Company generates revenues from sales of products manufactured based on the Companys technology. The Company develops, design and\nmanufactures both standard and customizable high-end digital Video & Audio products. The Companys products include proprietary software\n(firmware) embedded into the tangible products and is not sold separately. The Company only sells its products to end customers with no right of\nreturn.\nF-9\nf20f2022_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 115\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 03/06/2023 07:52 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n(U.S. dollars)\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nThe Company applies ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when\nits customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in\nexchange for those goods or services.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps:\n(1) Identify the contract(s) with a customer,\n(2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract,\n(3) Determine the transaction price,\n(4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and\n(5) Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nIdentifying the contract with a customer:\nThe Company accounts for a contract with a customer when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties and\npayment terms are identified and agreed upon, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\nFor each contract, the Company exercises judgement to identify separate performance obligations and to evaluate, at the inception of the contract,\nif each distinct performance obligation within the contract is satisfied at a point in time or over time.\nIdentifying the performance obligations in the contract:\nThe Companys sales transactions include a single performance obligation which is the delivery of the product to the customer. The Company is\nnot obligated and does not provide the customer with an updated version of the products embedded software following the initial transaction.\nTherefore, the Companys transactions do not include any performance obligation relating to potential upgrades or updates for the software or\nproduct.\nIn certain cases, the Company customizes its products based on its customers requirements (Proof of Concept (POC) transactions). In addition,\ncommencing 2021, the Company also enters into several transactions in which it develops a specialized product, based on the Costumers\nrequirements (Non-Recuring Engineering (NRE) transactions). In these transactions, the Company has determined that the development or the\ncustomization and the delivery of these products are not distinct within the context of the contract, since the nature of the Companys promise is to\ntransfer a combined output to which each of these components is an input. Therefore, these transactions include a single performance obligation\nwhich is the customized product.\nDetermining the transaction price:\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected\non behalf of third parties (such as sales tax). The Companys transaction does not include a significant financing component as all amounts are due\nwithin few months from transfer of Control.\nRecognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation:\nThe Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over its product to a customer based on the\nshipment terms. In most cases, control is transferred at Companys premises (Ex-work terms).\nF-10\nf20f2022_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 116\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 03/06/2023 07:52 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n(U.S. dollars)\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nAs for the POC and NRE transactions, the Company analyzed the criteria in ASC 606 to determine whether control over products sold under the\ncontracts is transferred over time. Mainly, whether the Companys performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company,\nand if it has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. In its POC transactions, the Company has an enforceable right to\npayment for performance completed through the term of the contract with its customers. However, the customized product has an alternative use\nfor the Company, therefore, none of the conditions stipulated in ASC 606 are met for recognizing revenue over time. Accordingly, revenue from\nPOC transactions is recognized at a point in time, upon delivery of the product to the customer usually on EX-Works terms.\nIn the NRE transactions the Company determines that the specialized product does not have an alternative use for the Company, and it has an\nenforceable right to payment for performance completed through the term of the contract. Therefore, in these transactions, revenue is recognized\nover time using the cost-to-cost method. The Company uses significant judgment when it determines the costs expected to be incurred upon\nsatisfying the identified performance obligation.\nSee also Note 10 for further information regarding the Companys revenue transactions.\nI. Deferred issuance costs\nThe Company capitalized certain legal, professional accounting and other third-party fees that were directly associated with the IPO, as deferred\ncosts until the IPO was consummated. Following the completion of the IPO, these fees were recorded in the stockholders equity as a reduction of\nadditional paid-in capital generated as a result of the activity. The deferred issuance costs in the amount of $871,171 which were capitalized as of\nDecember 31, 2021 in long term assets were charged to equity during 2022 in conjunction with the IPO.\nJ. Warrant classification\nWhen the Company issues freestanding instruments, it first analyzes the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC\nTopic 480, distinguishing liabilities from equity (ASC 480) in order to determine whether the instrument should be classified as a liability, with\nsubsequent changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations in each period. If the instrument is not within the scope of ASC 480,\nthe Company further analyzes the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 815, derivatives and hedging (ASC 815-10) in order to determine whether the\ninstrument is considered indexed to the entitys own stock, and qualifies for classification within equity. If the provisions of ASC 815-10 for equity\nclassification are not met, the instrument is classified as a liability, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations\nin each period.\nK. Warranty reserve\nThe Company provides a one-year standard warranty for its products. The Company records a provision for the estimated cost to repair or replace\nproducts under warranty at the time of sale. Factors that affect the Companys warranty reserve include the number of units sold, historical and\nanticipated rates of warranty repairs and the cost per repair. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities\nand adjusts the amounts as necessary.\nF-11\nf20f2022_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 117\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 03/06/2023 07:52 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n(U.S. dollars)\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nThe following table sets forth activity in the Companys accrued warranty account for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nrespectively:\n2022 2021 2020\nBalance at beginning of the year 20,758 9,879 8,930\nCost incurred (3,220) (5,850) -\nExpense recognized 7,511 16,729 949\nBalance at end of year 25,049 20,758 9,879\nL. Research, development costs and intangible assets\nResearch and development costs, which consist mainly of labor costs, materials and subcontractor costs, are charged to operations as incurred.\nAccording to ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, software that is part of a product or process to be sold to a customer shall be\naccounted for under ASC subtopic 985-20. The Companys products contain embedded software which is an integral part of these products\nbecause it allows the various components of the products to communicate with each other and the products are clearly unable to function without\nthis coding. Based on the Companys product development process, the Company does not incur material costs after the point in time at which the\nproduct as a whole reaches technological feasibility. Therefore, research and development costs are charged to the statement of operations as\nincurred.\nParticipation by government departments and from research foundations for development of approved projects is recognized as a reduction of\nexpense as the related costs are incurred.\nM. Basic and diluted net loss per share\nBasic and diluted net loss per Ordinary Share is computed based on the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during each\nyear. Shares issuable are considered outstanding Ordinary Shares, including the Preferred Shares (prior to their conversion into Ordinary Shares),\nand included in the computation of basic net loss per Ordinary Share as of the date that all necessary conditions have been satisfied.\nThe denominator for diluted net loss per share is a computation of the weighted-average number of Ordinary Shares and the potential dilutive\nOrdinary Shares outstanding during the period. Potential dilutive shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of in-the-money options and\nwarrants using the treasury stock method.\nN. Fair value of financial instruments\nThe Companys financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, trade receivables, restricted deposits\nincluding deposits for employee benefits, trade payable, and long-term loans.\nF-12\nf20f2022_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 118\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 03/06/2023 07:52 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n(U.S. dollars)\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nFair value for the measurement of financial assets and liabilities is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that\nshould be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company utilizes a valuation\nhierarchy for disclosure of the inputs for fair value measurement. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:\nLevel 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the\nmeasurement date.\nLevel 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for\nsubstantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available,\nthereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.\nBy distinguishing between inputs that are observable in the market place, and therefore more objective, and those that are unobservable and\ntherefore more subjective, the hierarchy is designed to indicate the relative reliability of the fair value measurements. A financial asset or liabilitys\nclassification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe Company, in estimating fair value for financial instruments, determined that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term\ndeposits, trade receivables, restricted deposits including deposits for employee benefits and trade payables are equivalent to, or approximate their\nfair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amounts of variable interest rate long-term loans are equivalent or\napproximate to their fair value as they bear interest at approximate market rates. The liabilities include long-term loans from shareholders that have\nno maturity dates, bear no interest and are not linked to any index.\nO. Segments\nThe Company operates in one segment. Management does not segregate its business for internal reporting. The Companys chief operating\ndecision maker (CODM), who is the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of its business based on financial data consistent with\nthe presentation in the accompanying financial statements. The Company concluded that its unified business is conducted globally and accordingly\nrepresents one operating segment.\nP. Income taxes\nThe Company accounts for taxes on income in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which prescribes the use of the asset and liability\nmethod whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax\nbases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to\nreverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value if it is more\nlikely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence.\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are classified as non-current in accordance with ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes .\nF-13\nf20f2022_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 119\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 03/06/2023 07:52 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n(U.S. dollars)\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740-10. ASC 740-10 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and\nmeasuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the\nweight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that, on an evaluation of the technical merits, the tax position will be sustained\non audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that\nis more than 50% (cumulative probability) likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nThe Company accounts for interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.\nQ. Severance pay\nThe Companys liability for severance pay for some of its Israeli employees is calculated pursuant to Israeli Severance Pay Law, 1963 (the Israeli\nSeverance Pay Law) based on the most recent salary of the employee multiplied by the number of years of employment until June 30, 2022.\nThose employees are entitled to one months salary for each year of employment or a portion thereof. The Company records the liability as if it\nwere payable at each balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis.\nThe Companys liability for those Israeli employees is provided for by monthly deposits funded for insurance policies until June 30, 2022 and the\nremainder by an accrual. The value of these policies is recorded as an asset in the Companys balance sheet.\nThe deposited funds include profits and losses accumulated up to the balance sheet date. The deposited funds may be withdrawn only upon the\nfulfillment of the obligation pursuant to the Israeli Severance Pay Law or labor agreements. The value of the deposited funds is based on the cash\nsurrender value of these policies.\nIn accordance with the current employment agreements with certain employees, and for the period commencing July 1, 2022 for the employees\nmentioned above, the Company makes regular deposits with certain insurance companies for accounts controlled by each applicable employee in\norder to secure the employees rights upon retirement. Pursuant to applicable Israeli law, the Company is fully relieved from any severance pay\nliability with respect to each such employee if it makes such payments on behalf of the employee. The liability accrued in respect of such\nemployees and the amounts funded, as of the respective agreement dates, are not reflected in the Companys balance sheets, since the Company\ndoes not control or manage the funds and the pension or severance pay risks are irrevocably transferred to the applicable insurance companies.\nSeverance pay expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 amounted to $61,169 , $ 31,356 and $22,247, respectively.\nR. Concentrations of credit or business risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, bank deposits,\ntrade receivables and trade payables.\nCash equivalents and bank deposits are invested mainly in NIS and U.S. dollars with major banks in Israel. Management believes that the financial\ninstitutions that hold the Companys investments are financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these\ninvestments.\nMost of the Companys trade receivables are derived from sales to large and financially secure organizations. In determining the adequacy of the\nallowance, management bases its opinion, inter alia, on the estimated risks, current market conditions and in reliance on available information with\nrespect to the debtors financial position. See Note 10 for a discussion of the Companys major customers.\nThe Company acquires certain component parts for its products from market leading suppliers that are single source manufacturers. In order to\nmitigate the risk and as a redundant solution, the Company designs similar products based on component parts from different suppliers.\nF-14\nf20f2022_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 120\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 03/06/2023 07:52 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n(U.S. dollars)\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nS. Commitments and contingencies\nLiabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigations, fines and penalties and other sources are recognized when it is\nprobable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are recognized when\nthey are realized or when all related contingencies have been resolved.\nT. Cash and cash equivalents in Statement of Cash Flows\nThe Company implements the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which\nrequires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included within cash and cash equivalents when\nreconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown in the statement of cash flows.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents reported within the accompanying\nbalance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts presented in the accompanying statements of cash flows:\nDecember 31,\n2022 2021\nCash and cash equivalents $ 221,961 $ 785\nRestricted deposits 33,569 48,341\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted deposits presented in the statements of cash flows $ 255,530 $ 49,126\nU. Leases\nThe Company adopted ASC 842, Leases (ASC 842) on January 1, 2022, using a modified retrospective basis and applied the practical\nexpedients related to the transition, see also Note 2W. The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease for accounting purposes at\ncontract inception. Operating leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets, which are included in right-of-use assets, and lease liabilities,\nwhich are included in other payable and non-current operating lease liabilities on the balance sheets, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the\nCompany did not have any finance leases.\nROU assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to\nmake lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present\nvalue of lease payments over the lease term. The Companys leases do not provide an implicit rate; the Company uses an incremental borrowing\nrate for specific terms on a collateralized basis based on the information available on either ASC 842, transition date or commencement date, as\napplicable in determining the present value of lease payments.\nThe ROU asset calculation includes lease payments to be made. The ROU asset and lease liability may include amounts attributed to options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition, upon transition the Company has elected the practical expedients related to\nlease classification and hindsight.\nF-15\nf20f2022_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 121\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 03/06/2023 07:52 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n(U.S. dollars)\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nV. Share based compensation\nThe Company applies ASC 718, Share-based Payment (ASC 718). ASC 718 requires awards classified as equity awards to be accounted for\nusing the grant-date fair value method. The fair value of share-based payment transactions is recognized as expense over the requisite service\nperiod. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\nThe Company measures the compensation cost related to the options awarded on the grant date and recognize the cost on a straight-line method\nover the requisite service period of the awards, including awards with graded vesting and no additional conditions for vesting other than service\nconditions.\nFair value of the equity instrument issued to a non-employee is measured as of the grant date. The fair value of the awards is recognized over the\nvesting period, which coincides with the period that the counter-party is providing services to the Company.\nW. Recently issued accounting pronouncements adopted\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 regarding FASB ASC 842. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and\nlease liabilities for those leases classified as operating leases under previous FASB guidance. The Company adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2022,\nusing a modified retrospective basis and applied the practical expedients related to the transition. Consequently, financial information was not\nupdated and the disclosures required under the standard are not provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2022. The adoption resulted in an\nincrease of approximately $530,444 for the right of use lease assets against lease liabilities. See also note 2U above.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt  Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and\nHedging  Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815  40 (ASU 2020-06). This guidance simplifies the accounting for certain financial\ninstruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entitys own equity. The\namendments to this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years.\nThe Company decided to early adopt ASU 2020-06 as of January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Companys\nfinancial statements.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), which requires annual disclosures that increase the\ntransparency of transactions involving government grants, including (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for those transactions, and (3)\nthe effect of those transactions on an entitys financial statements. The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for\nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. See note 9C.\nX. Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nAs an emerging growth company, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act) allows the Company to delay adoption of new\nor revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. The\nCompany has elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. The adoption dates discussed below reflect this election.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments  Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments (ASU 2016-13), which replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected credit loss model and requires a\nfinancial asset measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The guidance will be effective for\nfiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating\nthe effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.\nF-16\nf20f2022_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 122\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 03/06/2023 07:52 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n(U.S. dollars)\nNote 3 - Restricted Deposits\nBalances at December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of bank deposits.

Israeli Innovation Authority Grants\nThe Company has entered into several research and development programs, pursuant to which the Company received grants from the Israeli\nInnovation Authority (IIA), and are therefore in some cases obligated to pay royalties to the IIA at a rate of 3% to 5% on sales proceeds from\nproducts that were developed under IIA programs up to the total amount of grants received (linked to the U.S. dollar with annual interest at LIBOR\nas of the date of approval, for programs approved from January 1, 1999 and thereafter). The Company may be required to pay additional royalties\nupon the occurrence of certain events as determined by the IIA, that are within the control of the Company. No such events have occurred or were\nprobable of occurrence as of the balance sheet date with respect to these royalties.\nThe total amount of grants received as of December 31, 2022, which the Company is obligated to pay royalties as described above, was\napproximately $285,204 (including accumulated interest). During the year 2012, the Company paid the IIA royalties in the amount of\napproximately $7,301 in connection with a single sale for pilot purposes. Since 2013, the Company did not utilize the intellectual property that was\ndeveloped using the governmental grant in any of its products.\nIn August 2022, the Company received approval for a joint grant with Ben Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel, from the IIA for the joint\ndevelopment of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based system for detecting, diagnosing and predicting faults and\nmalfunction in drones. This grant is not subject to royalty payments to the IIA. The total approved budget the Company received for the first year\nof the joint project amounts to NIS 1,314,024 (approximately $373,408).

Corporate tax rate\nThe standard tax rate in Israel was 23% during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nUnder the Economic Policy Law for 2011 and 2012 (Legislation Amendments), 2011, which amended the Israel Capital Investments\nEncouragement Law, 1959 and under the Economic Efficiency Law (Legislative Amendments for Implementing the Economic Policy for the 2017\nand 2018 Budget Year) was published and added, under Amendment 73, such that the income of companies with enterprises preferred enterprise\nand companies with knowledge intensive industries  preferred technologic enterprise and special preferred technologic enterprise will receive\ntax benefits. Detailed rules apply under amendment 73 of the Capital Investments Law.\nThe Company has a balance of carryforward losses and will consider its qualification for the 2017 amendment and the term and degree to which it\nmay be qualified as a Preferred Technology Enterprise or Special Preferred Technology Enterprise upon profitability.\nB. Deferred tax assets and liabilities:\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial\nreporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred taxes are computed using the standard tax rates of 23%. The expected\ntax rate can be lower as a preferred technologic enterprise and depends on the fulfillment of conditions set forth in the law. Significant components\nof the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2022 2021\nIn Respect of:\nNet Operating Loss Carry forward $ 1,218,869 $ 675,604\nResearch and development expenses 189,856 181,964\nProvision for warranty 5,761 4,774\nProvision for vacation and convalescence 49,850 20,575\nProvision for Severance, net 62,060 31,254\nOperating lease right of use assets (134,836) -\nIssuance cost 381,090\nOperating lease liabilities 134,836 -\nLess - valuation allowance (1,907,486) (914,171)\nNet deferred tax assets $ - $ -\nThe net changes in the total valuation allowance for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, are comprised as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nBalance at beginning of year $ 914,171 $ 636,462\nAdditions during the year 993,315 277,709\nBalance at the end of year $ 1,907,486 $ 914,171\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax\nassets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in\nwhich those temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible. Based on the level of historical taxable losses, management has reduced the\ndeferred tax assets with a valuation allowance to the full amount to be realized.\nC. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the operating loss carry-forwards amounted to $5.2 million and $2.4 million, respectively.\nOperating losses in Israel may be carried forward indefinitely to offset against future taxable operational income.\nD. Reconciliation of the theoretical tax expense to actual tax expense\nThe main reconciling item between the statutory tax rate of the Company and the effective rate is the provision for a full valuation allowance in\nrespect of tax benefits from carry forward tax losses due to the uncertainty of the realization of such tax benefits (see above).\nF-27\nf20f2022_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 133\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 03/06/2023 07:52 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n(U.S. dollars)\nNote 16 - Leases\nThe Company is a party to two lease agreements for its facilities in Israel until October 2024.

You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information in this\nannual report on Form 20-F. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or\nthat we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations. If any of these risks actually occurs, our\nbusiness and financial condition could suffer and the price of our securities could decline. This annual report also contains forward-looking statements\nthat involve risks and uncertainties. Our results could materially differ from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, as a result of certain\nfactors including the risks described below and elsewhere in this report and our other Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, filings. See\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements above.\nSummary Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry, Operations and Financial Condition\nthe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and will continue to affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of\noperations;\nwe are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been significantly impacted by\ngeopolitical instability due to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine;\nwe have been operating at a loss since our inception and may never be profitable;\namounts included in backlog may not result in actual revenue and are an uncertain indicator of our future earnings;\nwe may not have sufficient manufacturing capabilities to satisfy any growing demand for our commissioned products. We may be unable to\ncontrol the availability or cost of producing such products;\nwe operate in an evolving industry and, as a result, our past results may not be indicative of future operating performance;\nour commercial success depends upon the degree of market acceptance by the professional, homeland security, or HLS, and defense markets\nas well as by other prospective markets and industries;\nwe may not be able to introduce products acceptable to customers and we may not be able to improve the technology used in our current\nsystems in response to changing technology and end-user needs;\n1\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 7\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\npotential growth of our business is based on international expansion, making us susceptible to risks associated with international sales and\noperations;\nwe expect to face significant competition. If we cannot successfully compete with new or existing technologies or future developed\nproducts, our marketing and sales will suffer and we may never be profitable;\nsignificant merchandise returns and recalls of our ready-made products could harm our business;\nif we fail to offer high-quality customer support, our business and reputation may suffer;\nour reliance on third-party suppliers for most of the component parts of our products could harm our ability to meet demand for our products\nin a timely and cost-effective manner;\nif we are unable to establish significant sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into successful relationships with business\ntargets and third parties to perform these services, we may not be successful in commercializing our products and technology;\nwe may require substantial additional funding to grow our business, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all;\nwe may not accurately forecast revenues, profitability and appropriately plan our expenses;\nwe rely on highly skilled personnel, and, if we are unable to attract, retain or motivate qualified personnel, we may not be able to operate\nour business effectively;\nwe may have difficulty in entering into and maintaining strategic alliances with third parties;\nwe may not be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights necessary to protect our proprietary technology and business;\nwe may be unable to keep pace with changes in technology as our business and market strategy evolves;\nsignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or breaches of our data security could adversely affect our business;\nwe may be subject to general litigation, regulatory disputes and government inquiries;\nwe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that could, if not remediated, result in material\nmisstatements in our financial statements. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not\nbe able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, shareholders could lose confidence in our financial and other\npublic reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our ordinary shares;\nnew regulation as well as regulation in new target territories, including regulation relating to unmanned platforms, video and audio systems,\nmay create obstacles to our sales and marketing efforts;\nRisks Related to Israeli Law and our Operations in Israel\npolitical, economic and military instability in Israel may impede our ability to operate and harm our financial results;\nexchange rate fluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar may negatively affect our earnings;\n2\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 8\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nwe may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees, which could result in\nlitigation and adversely affect our business;\nwe received Israeli government grants for certain of our research and development activities, the terms of which may require us to pay\nroyalties and to satisfy specified conditions in order to manufacture products and transfer technologies outside of Israel. If we fail to satisfy\nthese conditions, we may be required to pay penalties and refund grants previously received;\nRisks Related to Our Status as a Public Company and Ownership of our Ordinary Shares and Warrants\nAs of date of December 31, 2021, our principal shareholders, officers and directors beneficially owned 100% of our ordinary shares, no par\nvalue, or our Ordinary Shares. Following the IPO, and as of the date of this annual report, our principal shareholders, officers and directors\nbeneficially own in aggregate approximately 40.37% of our Ordinary Shares and as such will be able to exert significant control over\nmatters submitted to our shareholders for approval;\nwe are an emerging growth company and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure\nrequirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our securities less attractive to investors;\nwe incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company;\nthe estimates of market opportunity, market size and forecasts of market growth included in our publicly-filed documents may prove to be\ninaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rate, if at\nall;\nthe market price of our Ordinary Shares and warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares, or the Warrants, may be highly volatile and such\nvolatility could cause you to lose some or all of your investment and also subject us to litigation; and\nyour ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry, Operations and Financial Condition\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and will continue to affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected businesses, economies and financial\nmarkets worldwide, placed constraints on the operations of businesses, decreased consumer mobility and activity, and caused significant economic\nvolatility globally. We have followed guidance issued by the U.S. and Israeli governments and the other local governments in territories in which we\noperate to protect our employees. As such, we have implemented work from home where possible, minimized face-to-face meetings and utilized video\nconference as much as possible and adhered to social distancing rules at our facilities while eliminating of all international travel, which required us to\nuse local representatives to handle presentations and demonstrations for oversees customers. As a result, we have experienced some difficulties in\nemployee ability to efficiently collaborate to meet our customer needs, a difficulty in our efforts to recruit and hire qualified personnel during this time,\nand have recorded a minor increase in revenue in 2020 compared to 2019, both due to the lockdown and restrictions, and our governmental customers\npostponing or being hesitant of making future financial commitments due to the need to put response to the pandemic at the forefront. Our financial\ncondition and results of operations were not negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the year ended December 31, 2021.\n3\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 9\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nIn addition, and most importantly, the electronics components shortage crisis, a unique result of the COVID-19 pandemic which affected our\nmarket segment, has increased the lead time to obtain and the purchase prices of the component parts required for certain of our products, which has also\nnegatively impacted the delivery time of our products to customers and our revenues and profitability. As long as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the\ncomponents lead time may be longer than normal and shortage in components may continue or get worse. Therefore, the Company maintains a\ncomprehensive network of world-wide suppliers. In order to mitigate such risks, in cases where certain components are purchased from single source\nmanufacturers, the Company has adjusted and modified it designs based on different components from different suppliers, to allow for more versatility\nand flexibility.\nWe cannot predict the other future potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business or operations, and there is no guarantee that\nany near-term trends in our results of operations will continue, particularly if the COVID-19 pandemic and the adverse consequences thereof return.\nAdditional waves of infections, a continuation of the current environment, or any further adverse impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could\nfurther impact employment rates and the economy, affecting our consumer base and divert consumers discretionary income to other uses, including for\nessential items. These events could impact our cash flows, results of operations and financial conditions and heighten many of the other risks described in\nthis annual report.\nWe are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has been significantly impacted by geopolitical\ninstability due to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be\nmaterially adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or any other\ngeopolitical tensions.\nU.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the start of the military\nconflict between Russia and Ukraine. On February 24, 2022, a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops was reported. Although the\nlength and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine could lead to market disruptions, including significant\nvolatility in credit and capital markets.\nAdditionally, Russias prior annexation of Crimea, recent recognition of two separatist republics in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine\nand subsequent military interventions in Ukraine have led to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the United States, European Union and other\ncountries against Russia, Belarus, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk Peoples Republic, and the so-called Luhansk Peoples Republic,\nincluding agreement to remove certain Russian financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication payment\nsystem. Additional potential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or threatened. Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could\nadversely affect the global economy and financial markets.\nAny of the abovementioned factors could affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. The extent and duration of the\nmilitary action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial. Any such disruptions may also magnify the\nimpact of other risks described in this annual report.\nWe have been operating at a loss since our inception and may never be profitable.\nWe have been operating at a loss since our inception. In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 we had a loss of $824,224,\n$640,343 and $548,244, respectively.\nWe anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we expand our operations and continue to invest in developing our product\npipeline. These expenses may exceed our budgeted amounts and our revenues may not increase sufficiently to turn an operating profit and become cash\nflow positive. If any of the foregoing occur, we may continue to incur losses and remain unprofitable.\n4\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 10\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nAmounts included in backlog may not result in actual revenue and are an uncertain indicator of our future earnings.\nAs of January 1, 2022, our backlog was approximately $608,000. As of April 28, 2022, our backlog was approximately $1,202,000. We define\nbacklog as the accumulation of all pending orders with a later fulfillment date for which revenue has not been recognized and we consider valid. Our\norder backlog is comprised of executed purchase orders from high rated leading customers in the defense industries, also referred to as triple A\ncustomers, customers with which we have had long-standing relationships and governmental agencies. The disclosure of backlog aids in the analysis of\nthe demand for the Companys products, as well as the Companys ability to meet that demand. However, because revenue will not be recognized until\nwe have fulfilled our obligations to a customer, there may be a significant amount of time between executing a contract with a customer and delivery of\nthe product to the customer and revenue recognition. In addition, backlog is not necessarily indicative of our revenues to be recognized in a specified\nfuture period and we cannot assure that we will recognize revenue with respect to each order included in backlog. Our customers may order products\nfrom multiple sources to ensure timely delivery and may cancel or defer orders without significant penalty. Our customers also may cancel orders when\nbusiness is weaker and inventories are excessive. While as of the date of this annual report, no orders were cancelled, should a cancellation occur, our\nbacklog and anticipated revenue would be reduced unless we were able to replace the cancelled order. As a result, we cannot provide assurances as to the\nportion of backlog orders to be filled in a given year, and our order backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual revenues for any\nsubsequent period.\nWe may not have sufficient manufacturing capabilities to satisfy any growing demand for our commissioned products. We may be unable to control\nthe availability or cost of producing such products.\nOur current manufacturing capabilities may not reach the required production levels necessary in order to meet growing demands for any\nproducts we may commission or future products we may develop. There can be no assurance that our commissioned products can be manufactured at our\ndesired commercial quantities, in compliance with our requirements and at an acceptable cost. Any such failure could delay or prevent us from shipping\nsaid products and marketing our technologies in accordance with our target growth strategies.\nWe operate in an evolving industry and, as a result, our past results may not be indicative of future operating performance.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving industry that may not develop in a manner favorable to our business. Therefore, it may be difficult to assess our\nfuture performance. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter.\nOur future success will depend in large part upon our ability to, inter alia:\nmanage our inventory effectively;\nsuccessfully develop, retain and expand our consumer product offering and geographic reach;\ncompete effectively;\n5\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 11\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes;\neffectively manage our growth;\nhire, integrate and retain talented people at all levels of our organization;\navoid interruptions in our business from information technology downtime, cybersecurity breaches or labor stoppages;\nmaintain the quality of our technology infrastructure; and\ndevelop new features to enhance functionality.\nOur commercial success depends upon the degree of market acceptance by the professional, HLS and defense markets as well as by other prospective\nmarkets and industries.\nWe provide intelligent video transmission and artificial intelligence, or AI, technologies for professional, HLS and defense applications. Our\ncurrent business model is that of a business-to-business approach, or B2B, in which we seek to identify target businesses interested in integrating our\ntechnology, or commissioning individual projects using our technology. Any product that we commission or that is brought to the market may or may not\ngain market acceptance by prospective customers. The commercial success of our technologies, commissioned products and any future product that we\nmay develop depends in part on the professional, HLS and defense community as well as other industries for various use cases, depending on the\nacceptance by such industries of our commissioned products as a useful and cost-effective solution compared to current technologies. Even though our\nB2B products are custom made, step by step with our customers in order to ensure compatibility and acceptance, if our technology or any future product\nthat we may develop does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, or does not garner significant commercial appeal, we may not generate significant\nrevenue and may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, including:\nthe cost, size, weight, efficacy, performance, and convenience of our technology in relation to alternative products;\nthe ability of third parties to enter into relationships with us without violating their existing agreements;\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support for competing technology and products; and\npublicity concerning our technology or commissioned products or competing technology and products.\nOur efforts to penetrate industries and educate the marketplace on the benefits of our technology, and reasons to seek the commissioning of\nproducts based on our technology, may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts to educate the marketplace may require\nmore resources than are required by conventional technologies.\nWe may not be able to introduce products acceptable to customers and we may not be able to improve the technology used in our current systems in\nresponse to changing technology and end-user needs.\nThe markets in which we operate are subject to rapid and substantial innovation and technological change, mainly driven by technological\nadvances and end-user requirements and preferences, as well as the emergence of new standards and practices. Even if we are able to complete the\ndevelopment of our products in development, our ability to compete in the unmanned platform markets will depend, in large part, on our future success in\nenhancing our existing products and developing new systems that will address the varied needs of prospective end-users, and respond to technological\nadvances and industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis to otherwise gain market acceptance.\n6\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 12\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nEven if we successfully introduce our existing products in development, it is likely that new systems and technologies that we develop will\neventually supplant our existing systems or that our competitors will create systems that will replace our systems. As a result, any of our products may be\nrendered obsolete or uneconomical by our or others technological advances.\nPotential growth of our business is based on international expansion, making us susceptible to risks associated with international sales and\noperations.\nHaving consolidated our position in the local Israeli market, we have plans to expand internationally with broad range of the field-tested video\nand data analytics products. Conducting international operations subjects us to certain risks which include localization of solutions and products and\nadapting them to local practices and regulatory requirements, exchange rate fluctuations and unexpected changes in tax, trade laws, tariffs, governmental\ncontrols and other trade restrictions. To the extent that we do not succeed in expanding our operations internationally and managing the associated legal\nand operational risks, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe expect to face significant competition. If we cannot successfully compete with new or existing technologies or future developed products, our\nmarketing and sales will suffer and we may never be profitable.\nBased on product comparisons that we have conducted, and in reviewing our products against the comparable products offered by our leading\ncompetitors, we believe that our products have significant advantages compared to our competitors, both in terms of miniaturization, latency and\nfunctionality, and in our products ability to provide our customers with a single solution that addresses all their needs in a single customizable, modular\nproduct. Nonetheless, we are continuously competing against existing technologies in different industries and we cannot exclude the possibility of new\ntechnologies or innovations created by our competitors in the future. Some of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners,\noperate larger research and development programs than we do, and may have substantially greater financial resources than we do, which may, in the long\nrun hinder us from competing effectively against our competitors, which could reduce our market share and ability to develop or secure new customers\nand adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nSignificant merchandise returns and recalls of our ready-made products could harm our business.\nDisruptions affecting the introduction, release or performance of our ready-made products may damage customers businesses and could harm\ntheir and our reputation. We may be subject to warranty and liability claims for damages related to defects in those products. In addition, if we do not\nmeet industry or quality standards, if applicable, then the products may be subject to a recall, a material liability claim, or other occurrence that harms our\nreputation or decreases market acceptance of our products and could adversely impact our operating results.\nIf we fail to offer high-quality customer support, our business and reputation may suffer.\nHigh-quality customer support is important for the successful retention of existing customers. Providing this support requires that our support\npersonnel have specific knowledge and expertise of our products and markets, making it more difficult for us to hire qualified personnel and to scale up\nour support operations. The importance of high-quality customer support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers. If we do not\nprovide effective and timely ongoing support, our ability to retain existing customers may suffer, and our reputation with existing or potential customers\nmay be harmed, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n7\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 13\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nOur reliance on third-party suppliers for most of the component parts of our products could harm our ability to meet demand for our products in a\ntimely and cost-effective manner.\nThough we attempt to ensure the availability of more than one supplier for each important component in any product that we commission, the\nnumber of suppliers engaged in the provision of the specified components suitable for our miniature intelligent video surveillance and communication\ntechnology products is limited, and therefore in some cases we engage with a single supplier, which may result in our dependency on such supplier. As\nsuch, we may be subject to disruptions in our operations if our sole or limited supply contract manufacturers decrease or stop production of components\nor do not produce components and products of sufficient quantity. Alternative sources for our component parts may not always be available. Many of our\ncomponent parts are manufactured overseas, so they have long lead times, and events such as local disruptions, natural disasters or political conflict may\ncause unexpected interruptions to the supply of our products or components. As such, the loss of one or more of our specified suppliers, and our inability\nor delay in finding suitable replacement suppliers, could significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nIf we are unable to establish significant sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into successful relationships with business targets and\nthird parties to perform these services, we may not be successful in commercializing our products and technology.\nGiven that we are currently a B2B company, our business is reliant on our ability to successfully attract potential business targets. Furthermore,\nwe have a limited sales and marketing infrastructure and have limited experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of our technologies beyond the\nB2B model. To achieve commercial success for our technologies or any future developed product, we will need to expand our current sales and\nmarketing infrastructure. There are risks involved with establishing and expanding our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example,\nrecruiting and training additional sales force could be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. In addition, our investment\nwould be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize any future products on our own include:\nour inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to potential customers;\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage; and\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we are unable to establish additional sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into successful arrangements with third parties to\nperform these services, our revenues and our profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our products inside or outside\nof Israel or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to\ndevote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution\ncapabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our technologies or any\nfuture products we may develop.\n8\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 14\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nChanges in our insurance coverage may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operational results.\nWe maintain a public offering of securities insurance and appropriate policies of insurance consistent with those customarily carried by\norganizations in our industry sector. These increases in the cost of such insurance policies or the industry in which we operate could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and operational results. Our insurance coverage may also be inadequate to cover losses it sustains. Uninsured loss or a loss\nin excess of our insured limits could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operational results.\nWe may require substantial additional funding to grow our business, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur cash balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $785 and $20,524, respectively. We may require additional funding to fund and grow\nour operations and to complete development of certain products and bring them to the market. There can be no assurance that any financing will be\navailable in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In the event we require additional capital, the inability to obtain additional capital will restrict\nour ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we will likely\nbe required to curtail our development plans. In that event, shareholders would likely experience a loss of most or all of their investment. Any additional\nfunding that we do obtain may be dilutive to the interests of existing shareholders.\nWe may not accurately forecast revenues, profitability and appropriately plan our expenses.\nWe base our current and future expense levels on our operating forecasts and estimates of future income and operating results. Income and\noperating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on the volume sales and timing, which are uncertain. Additionally, our business is\naffected by general economic and business conditions around the world. A softening in income, whether caused by changes in consumer preferences in\nthe unmanned platform markets, or a weakening in global economies, may result in decreased net revenue levels, and we may be unable to adjust our\nexpenses in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in income. This inability could cause our (loss)/income after tax in a given\nquarter to be (higher)/lower than expected. We also make certain assumptions when forecasting the amount of expense we expect related to our share-\nbased payments, which includes the expected volatility of our share price, and the expected life of share options granted. These assumptions are partly\nbased on historical results. If actual results differ from our estimates, our operating results in a given period may be lower than expected.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel, and, if we are unable to attract, retain or motivate qualified personnel, we may not be able to operate our\nbusiness effectively.\nOur success depends in large part on the continued employment of senior management and key personnel who can effectively operate our\nbusiness, as well as our ability to attract and retain skilled employees. Competition for highly skilled management, technical, research and development\nand other employees is intense and we may not be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel in the future. In making employment decisions,\ncandidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment. Our long-term incentive programs may\nnot be attractive enough or perform sufficiently to attract or retain qualified personnel.\nIf any of our employees leave us, and we fail to effectively manage a transition to new personnel, or if we fail to attract and retain qualified and\nexperienced professionals on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success also depends on our having highly trained financial, technical, recruiting, sales and marketing personnel. We will need to continue\nto hire additional personnel as our business grows. A shortage in the number of people with these skills or our failure to attract them to our company\ncould impede our ability to increase revenues from our existing technology and services or launch new product offerings and would have an adverse\neffect on our business and financial results.\n9\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 15\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nWe may have difficulty in entering into and maintaining strategic alliances with third parties.\nWe may enter into strategic alliances with third parties to gain access to new and innovative technologies and markets. These parties are often\nlarge, established companies. Negotiating and performing under these arrangements involves significant time and expense, particularly those with\ncompanies that have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. The anticipated benefits of these arrangements may never materialize,\nand performing under these arrangements may require significant resources which may affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights necessary to protect our proprietary technology and business.\nThe value of our products depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property, including trademarks, copyrights, patents and moral rights.\nWe currently have a patent application pending and may seek to patent additional concepts, components, processes, designs and methods, and\nother inventions and technologies that we consider to have commercial value or that will likely give us a technological advantage. Despite devoting\nresources to the research and development of proprietary technology, we may not be able to develop technology that is patentable or protectable. Patents\nmay not be issued in connection with pending patent applications, and claims allowed may not be sufficient to allow them to use the inventions that they\ncreate exclusively.\nFurthermore, any patents issued could be challenged, re-examined, held invalid or unenforceable or circumvented and may not provide sufficient\nprotection or a competitive advantage. In addition, despite efforts to protect and maintain patents, competitors and other third parties may be able to\ndesign around their patents or develop products similar to our work products that are not within the scope of their patents. Finally, patents provide certain\nstatutory protection only for a limited period of time that varies depending on the jurisdiction and type of patent.\nProsecution and protection of the rights sought in patent applications and patents can be costly and uncertain, often involve complex legal and\nfactual issues and consume significant time and resources. In addition, the breadth of claims allowed in our patents, their enforceability and our ability to\nprotect and maintain them cannot be predicted with any certainty. The laws of certain countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same\nextent as the laws of Israel. Even if our patents are held to be valid and enforceable in a certain jurisdiction, any legal proceedings that we may initiate\nagainst third parties to enforce such patents will likely be expensive, take significant time and divert managements attention from other business matters.\nWe cannot assure that any of our issued patents or pending patent applications provide any protectable, maintainable or enforceable rights or competitive\nadvantages to us.\nIn addition to patents, we will rely on a combination of proprietary know how, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other related laws and\nconfidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect, maintain and enforce our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights in Israel\nand other countries. However, our ability to protect our brands by registering certain trademarks may be limited. In addition, while we will generally\nenter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, contract manufacturers, distributors and resellers and with\nothers to attempt to limit access to and distribution of our proprietary and confidential information, it is possible that:\nmisappropriation of our proprietary and confidential information, including technology, will nevertheless occur;\nour confidentiality agreements will not be honored or may be rendered unenforceable;\nthird parties will independently develop equivalent, superior or competitive technology or products;\n10\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 16\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\ndisputes will arise with our current or future strategic licensees, customers or others concerning the ownership, validity, enforceability, use,\npatentability or registrability of intellectual property; or\nunauthorized disclosure of our know-how, trade secrets or other proprietary or confidential information will occur.\nWe cannot assure that we will be successful in protecting, maintaining or enforcing our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in\nprotecting, maintaining or enforcing our intellectual property rights, then our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially\nadversely affected, which could:\nadversely affect our reputation with customers;\nbe time-consuming and expensive to evaluate and defend;\ncause product shipment delays or stoppages;\ndivert managements attention and resources;\nsubject us to significant liabilities and damages;\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements; or\nrequire us to cease certain activities, including the sale of products.\nIf it is determined that we have infringed, violated or are infringing or violating a patent or other intellectual property right of any other person or\nif we are found liable in respect of any other related claim, then, in addition to being liable for potentially substantial damages, we may be prohibited\nfrom developing, using, distributing, selling or commercializing certain of our technologies unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or\nother intellectual property right. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any such license on a timely basis or on commercially favorable\nterms, or that any such licenses will be available, or that workarounds will be feasible and cost-efficient. If we do not obtain such a license or find a cost-\nefficient workaround, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and we could be required to cease\nrelated business operations in some markets and restructure our business to focus on our continuing operations in other markets.\nWe may be unable to keep pace with changes in technology as our business and market strategy evolves.\nWe will need to respond to technological advances in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to remain competitive. The need to respond to\ntechnological changes may require us to make substantial, unanticipated expenditures. There can be no assurance that we will be able to respond\nsuccessfully to technological changes. If we will be unable to respond successfully to technological advance, we may lose our competitive advantage,\nwhich could adversely affect our business.\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or breaches of our data security could adversely affect our business.\nA significant invasion, interruption, destruction or breakdown of our information technology systems and/or infrastructure by persons with\nauthorized or unauthorized access could negatively impact our business and operations. We could also experience business interruption, information theft\nand reputational damage from cyber-attacks, which may compromise our systems and lead to data leakage either internally or at our third-party providers.\nOur systems may be the target of malware and other cyber-attacks. Although we have invested in measures to reduce these risks, we cannot assure you\nthat these measures will be successful in preventing compromise or disruption of our information technology systems a data.\n11\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 17\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nWe may be subject to general litigation, regulatory disputes and government inquiries.\nAs a growing company with expanding operations, we may in the future increasingly face the risk of claims, lawsuits, government investigations\nand other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, accessibility claims, securities, tax, labor\nand employment, commercial disputes, services and other matters. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as the\npolitical and regulatory landscape changes, and as we have grown larger and expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our services have increased in\ncomplexity.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of such disputes and inquiries with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, these can have an adverse impact on us\nbecause of legal costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. Determining reserves for any litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process\nthat is subject to judgment calls. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could require us to make substantial payments to satisfy\njudgments, fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could harm our business. These proceedings could also result in reputational\nharm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain products or services or requiring a change in our business\npractices in costly ways or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Litigation and other claims and\nregulatory proceedings against us could result in unexpected expenses and liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results\nof operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements\nin our financial statements. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately\nreport our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, shareholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would\nharm our business and the trading price of our Ordinary Shares.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate\ndisclosure controls and procedures are designed to prevent fraud. Our management will be required to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls and\nprocedures and disclose changes in these controls on an annual basis. However, for as long as we are an emerging growth company under the JOBS\nAct, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting\npursuant to Section 404.\nAny failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet\nour reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404, or any subsequent testing by our independent\nregistered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or\nthat may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior\ninternal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading\nprice of our Ordinary Shares.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. As defined in Regulation 12b-2\nunder the Exchange Act, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there\nis a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual financial statements will not be prevented, or detected on a timely basis.\nSpecifically, we determined that the material weaknesses are related to having an insufficient number of financial reporting personnel with an appropriate\nlevel of knowledge, experience and training in the application of U.S. GAAP and SEC rules and regulations commensurate with our reporting\nrequirements and inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives.\n12\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 18\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nWe have taken action toward remediating these material weaknesses by hiring additional qualified personnel with U.S. GAAP accounting and\nreporting experience, and intend to provide enhanced training to existing financial and accounting employees on related U.S. GAAP issues. In addition, to\nremediate these material weaknesses, we are implementing measures including the following:\nwe have hired a chief financial officer with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience and we are continuing to seek additional financial\nprofessionals such as corporate controller to increase the number of qualified financial reporting personnel and implement segregation of\nduties; and\nwe are developing, communicating and implementing an accounting policy manual for our financial reporting personnel for recurring\ntransactions, period-end closing processes and policy relating to segregation of duties.\nHowever, the implementation of these initiatives may not fully address any material weakness or other deficiencies that we may have in our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nFurthermore, we have not yet commenced the process of determining whether our existing internal control over financial reporting systems are\ncompliant with Section 404 and whether there are any other material weaknesses in our existing internal controls. These controls and other procedures are\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is disclosed accurately and is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.\nEven if we develop effective internal control over financial reporting, these controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or\nthe degree of compliance with these policies or procedures may deteriorate, and material weaknesses and deficiencies may be discovered in them. We are\nworking with our legal, independent accounting and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and\nmanagement control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company. These areas include corporate governance, corporate\ncontrol, disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting.\nWe have made, and will continue to make, changes in these and other areas. In any event, the process of determining whether our existing\ninternal controls are compliant with Section 404 and sufficiently effective will require the investment of substantial time and resources, including by our\nchief financial officer and other members of our senior management. As a result, this process may divert internal resources and take a significant amount\nof time and effort to complete, even more so after we are no longer an Emerging Growth Company. In addition, we cannot predict the outcome of this\nprocess and whether we will need to implement remedial actions in order to implement effective controls over financial reporting. The determination of\nwhether or not our internal controls are sufficient and any remedial actions required could result in us incurring additional costs that we did not anticipate,\nincluding the hiring of outside consultants. We may also fail to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation needed to comply with\nSection 404 in a timely fashion. Irrespective of compliance with Section 404, any additional failure of our internal controls could have a material adverse\neffect on our stated results of operations and harm our reputation. As a result, we may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses, as well as\nhigher independent auditor fees during and after the implementation of these changes. If we are unable to implement any of the required changes to our\ninternal control over financial reporting effectively or efficiently or are required to do so earlier than anticipated, it could adversely affect our operations,\nfinancial reporting or results of operations and could result in an adverse opinion on internal controls from our independent auditors.\nFurthermore, if we are unable to certify that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and in compliance with Section 404, we may\nbe subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or stock exchanges, and we could lose investor confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could hurt our business, the price of our Ordinary Shares and our ability to access the capital\nmarket.\n13\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 19\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nNew regulation as well as regulation in new target territories, including regulation relating to unmanned platforms, video and audio systems, may\ncreate obstacles to our sales and marketing efforts.\nOther than the provisions of the Israeli Encouragement of Industrial Research, Development and Technological Innovation Law, 1984, as\namended, and related regulations, or the Research Law, which may restrict our ability to move the production of products developed using grants\nreceived from the Israeli Innovation Authority, or the IIA (see Risk Factors  Risks Related to Israeli Law and our Operations in Israel  We received\nIsraeli government grants for certain of our research and development activities, the terms of which may require us to pay royalties and to satisfy\nspecified conditions in order to manufacture products and transfer technologies outside of Israel. If we fail to satisfy these conditions, we may be required\nto pay penalties and refund grants previously received for further information), our products currently are not required to comply with any regulatory\nobligations in Israel. In events where our products have been required to comply with any foreign regulation, these issues have been under the jurisdiction\nand responsibility of our local distributors or customers. However, expansion of our operation into new territories, enhancing our sales and marketing in\nexisting foreign territories, as well as new regulations that might be enacted in the future which may apply to our technologies or market segment, may\nrequire us in the future to ensure that our products are in compliance with various regulatory constrains or technology standards imposed by local\nauthorities. Such development may require us to make additional expenses in order to ensure compliance, as well as hinder or delay us from entering\ncertain markets, thus adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operational results.\nRisks Related to Israeli Law and our Operations in Israel\nPolitical, economic and military instability in Israel may impede our ability to operate and harm our financial results.\nOur offices and management team are located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic, and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding\nregion may directly affect our business and operations. In May and June 2021 and in recent years, Israel has been engaged in sporadic armed conflicts\nwith Hamas, an Islamist terrorist group that controls the Gaza Strip, with Hezbollah, an Islamist terrorist group that controls large portions of southern\nLebanon, and with Iranian-backed military forces in Syria. In addition, Iran has threatened to attack Israel and may be developing nuclear weapons. Some\nof these hostilities were accompanied by missiles being fired from the Gaza Strip against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, including areas in\nwhich our employees and some of our consultants are located, and negatively affected business conditions in Israel. Any hostilities involving Israel or the\ninterruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and results of operations.\nOur commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with war and terrorism. Although the Israeli\ngovernment currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this\ngovernment coverage will be maintained or that it will sufficiently cover our potential damages. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the region would likely negatively affect business conditions and\ncould harm our results of operations.\nFurther, in the past, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subjected to economic boycotts. Several countries still restrict business\nwith the State of Israel and with Israeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may have an adverse impact on our operating results, financial\ncondition or the expansion of our business. A campaign of boycotts, divestment and sanctions has been undertaken against Israel, which could also\nadversely impact our business.\nIn addition, many Israeli citizens are obligated to perform several days, and in some cases more, of annual military reserve duty each year until\nthey reach the age of 40 (or older, for reservists who are military officers or who have certain occupations) and, in the event of a military conflict, may be\ncalled to active duty. In response to increases in terrorist activity, there have been periods of significant call-ups of military reservists. It is possible that\nthere will be military reserve duty call-ups in the future. Our operations could be disrupted by such call-ups, which may include the call-up of members of\nour management. Such disruption could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n14\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 20\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nExchange rate fluctuations between foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar may negatively affect our earnings.\nOur reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Our revenues are currently primarily payable in U.S. dollars and we expect our future\nrevenues to be denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. However, certain amounts of our revenues and expenses are also in NIS and Euro. As a result, we\nare exposed to the currency fluctuation risks relating to the recording of our expenses in U.S. dollars. We may, in the future, decide to enter into currency\nhedging transactions. These measures, however, may not adequately protect us from material adverse effects.\nWe may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees, which could result in litigation\nand adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our intellectual property has been developed by our employees in the course of their employment for us. Under the\nIsraeli Patent Law, 1967, or the Patent Law, inventions conceived by an employee in the course and as a result of or arising from his or her employment\nwith a company are regarded as service inventions, which belong to the employer, absent a specific agreement between the employee and employer\ngiving the employee service invention rights. The Patent Law also provides that if there is no such agreement between an employer and an employee, the\nIsraeli Compensation and Royalties Committee, or the Committee, a body constituted under the Patent Law, will determine whether the employee is\nentitled to remuneration for his inventions. Recent case law clarifies that the right to receive consideration for service inventions can be waived by the\nemployee and that in certain circumstances, such waiver does not necessarily have to be explicit. The Committee will examine, on a case-by-case basis,\nthe general contractual framework between the parties, using interpretation rules of the general Israeli contract laws. Further, the Committee has not yet\ndetermined one specific formula for calculating this remuneration (but rather uses the criteria specified in the Patent Law). Although we have entered into\nassignment-of-invention agreements with all our current and former employees pursuant to which such individuals assign to us all rights to any\ninventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement with us, we may still face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for\nassigned inventions. If such claims are found to have merit despite our assignment of invention agreements, we could be required to pay additional\nremuneration or royalties to our current and/or former employees, or be forced to litigate such claims, which could negatively affect our business.\nWe received Israeli government grants for certain of our research and development activities, the terms of which may require us to pay royalties and\nto satisfy specified conditions in order to manufacture products and transfer technologies outside of Israel. If we fail to satisfy these conditions, we\nmay be required to pay penalties and refund grants previously received.\nOur research and development efforts were financed in part through royalty-bearing grants from the IIA. In 2010 and 2012, the Company\nreceived the aggregate amount of approximately $285,204 (including accumulated interest) from the IIA for the development of our products.\nWith respect to such grants, we are committed to pay royalties at a rate of 3% to 5% on sales proceeds from our products that were developed\nunder IIA programs up to the total amount of grants received, linked to the U.S. dollar and bearing interest at an annual rate of LIBOR applicable to U.S.\ndollar deposits. As of April 28, 2022, we paid approximately $7,301 in connection with a single sale during 2012. Since 2013, the Company did not\nutilize the intellectual property that was developed using the governmental grant in any of its products. The total sum of royalties, including accumulated\ninterest, we are required to repay the IIA, as of April 28, 2022, is approximately $277,903, net, after deducting the sums we paid as royalties to the IIA.\nRegardless of any royalty payment, we are further required to comply with the requirements of the Research Law with respect to those past\ngrants. When a company develops know-how, technology or products using IIA grants, the terms of these grants and the Research Law restrict the\ntransfer of such know-how, and the transfer of manufacturing or manufacturing rights of such products, technologies or know-how outside of Israel,\nwithout the prior approval of the IIA. We may not receive those approvals. Furthermore, the IIA may impose certain conditions on any arrangement\nunder which it permits us to transfer technology or development. This may restrict our ability to move the production of our products outside of Israel, or\nto sell intellectual property and other know-how.\n15\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 21\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nIt may be difficult to enforce a judgment of a U.S. court against us and our executive officers and directors and the Israeli experts named in this\nannual report in Israel or the United States, to assert U.S. securities laws claims in Israel or to serve process on our executive officers and directors\nand these experts.\nWe were incorporated in Israel. Substantially all of our executive officers and directors reside outside of the United States, and all of our assets\nand most of the assets of these persons are located outside of the United States. Therefore, a judgment obtained against us, or any of these persons,\nincluding a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States and may not be\nenforced by an Israeli court. It also may be difficult for you to effect service of process on these persons in the United States or to assert U.S. securities\nlaw claims in original actions instituted in Israel. Additionally, it may be difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to initiate an action with\nrespect to U.S. securities laws in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of U.S. securities laws reasoning that Israel\nis not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli\nlaw and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proven as a fact by expert\nwitnesses, which can be a time consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding\ncase law in Israel that addresses the matters described above. As a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a judgment against us in Israel, you\nmay not be able to collect any damages awarded by either a U.S. or foreign court (see Enforceability of Civil Liabilities for additional information on\nyour ability to enforce a civil claim against us and our executive officers or directors named in this annual report).\nYour rights and responsibilities as a shareholder will be governed in key respects by Israeli laws, which differ in some material respects from the\nrights and responsibilities of shareholders of U.S. companies.\nThe rights and responsibilities of the holders of our Ordinary Shares are governed by our articles of association and by Israeli law. These rights\nand responsibilities differ in some material respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders in U.S. companies. In particular, a shareholder of\nan Israeli company has a duty to act in good faith and in a customary manner in exercising its rights and performing its obligations towards the company\nand other shareholders, and to refrain from abusing its power in such company, including, among other things, in voting at a general meeting of\nshareholders on matters such as amendments to a companys articles of association, increases in a companys authorized share capital, mergers and\nacquisitions and related party transactions requiring shareholder approval, as well as a general duty to refrain from discriminating against other\nshareholders. In addition, a shareholder who is aware that it possesses the power to determine the outcome of a vote at a meeting of the shareholders or to\nappoint or prevent the appointment of a director or executive officer in the company has a duty of fairness toward the company. There is limited case law\navailable to assist us in understanding the nature of these duties or the implications of these provisions. These provisions may be interpreted to impose\nadditional obligations and liabilities on holders of our ordinary shares that are not typically imposed on shareholders of U.S. companies.\n16\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 22\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nRisks Related to Our Status as a Public Company and Ownership of our Ordinary Shares and Warrants\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal shareholders, officers and directors beneficially owned 100% of our Ordinary Shares. Following our IPO,\nand as of the date of this annual report, our principal shareholders, officers and directors beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 40.37% of\nour Ordinary Shares and as such, they will therefore be able to exert significant control over matters submitted to our shareholders for approval.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal shareholders, officers and directors, in the aggregate beneficially owned 100% of our outstanding\nOrdinary Shares. As of the date of this annual report, our principal shareholders, officers and directors, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately\n40.37% of our outstanding Ordinary Shares. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our Ordinary\nShares because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with controlling shareholders. As a result, these shareholders, if\nthey acted together, could significantly influence matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of\nmergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of these shareholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of\nother shareholders.\nWe are an emerging growth company and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements\napplicable to emerging growth companies could make our securities less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of\nexemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including:\nnot being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting under\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\npermission to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies;\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and annual report on Form 20-F; and\nexemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any\ngolden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe may take advantage some or all of these and other exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We could be an\nemerging growth company up to the end of the fiscal year in which the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, although we\nexpect to not be an emerging growth company sooner. Our status as an emerging growth company will end as soon as any of the following take place:\nthe last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue;\nthe date we qualify as a large accelerated filer, with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates;\nthe date on which we have issued, in any three-year period, more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or\nthe last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary after we become a public company.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive if we choose to rely on any of the exemptions afforded emerging growth\ncompanies. If some investors find our securities less attractive because we rely on any of these exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for\nour securities and the market price of our securities may be more volatile.\nIn addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those\nstandards apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, as a result, our financial statements may not be\ncomparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are\napplicable to public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that we can elect to opt out of the extended transition period at any time, which\nelection is irrevocable.\n17\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 23\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nEven after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may qualify as a smaller reporting company, which would allow us to\ntake advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements (excluding the exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation\nrequirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and\nproxy statements. However, as a foreign private issuer we are not eligible to use the requirements for smaller reporting companies unless we use the\nforms and rules designated for domestic issuers and provide financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We cannot predict if investors\nwill find our securities less attractive if we may rely on either of these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there\nmay be a less active trading market for our securities and our share price may be more volatile.\nThe estimates of market opportunity, market size and forecasts of market growth included in our publicly-filed documents may prove to be inaccurate,\nand even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rate, if at all.\nMarket opportunity, size estimates and growth forecasts included in this annual report are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on\nassumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. Net revenue and operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on\nthe volume, timing and type of orders we receive, all of which are uncertain. We base our expense levels and investment plans on our estimates of total\nnet revenue and gross margins using human judgment combined with machine learning, natural language processing and data analytics. We cannot be\nsure the same growth rates, trends and other key performance metrics are meaningful predictors of future growth. If our assumptions and calculations\nprove to be wrong, we may spend more than we anticipate acquiring and retaining customers or may generate less net revenue per active customer than\nanticipated, any of which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are evaluating our total addressable market with respect to new product offerings and new markets. These estimates of total\naddressable market and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty, are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate\nand are based on data published by third parties that we have not independently verified. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates\nand growth forecasted in this annual report, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nOur business is also affected by general economic and business conditions in international markets. A significant portion of our expenses is\nfixed, and as a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in net revenue. Any failure\nto accurately predict net revenue or gross margins could cause our operating results to be lower than expected, which could materially adversely affect\nour financial condition and share price.\nThe market price of our Ordinary Shares and Warrants may be highly volatile and such volatility could cause you to lose some or all of your\ninvestment and also subject us to litigation.\nThe market price of our Ordinary Shares and Warrants may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond\nour control, such as:\nthe announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\ndevelopments concerning intellectual property rights;\nchanges in legal, regulatory, and enforcement frameworks impacting our technology or the application of our technology;\nvariations in our and our competitors results of operations;\n18\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 24\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nfluctuations in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if our securities are covered by analysts;\nthe results of product liability or intellectual property lawsuits;\nfuture issuances of securities;\nthe addition or departure of key personnel;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances;\ngeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance;\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events; and\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, in recent years, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect\nthe market prices of equity securities of many companies, and technology companies in particular. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or\ndisproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political\nand market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our\nOrdinary Shares or Warrants.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We\nmay be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our managements\nattention from other business concerns, which could also harm our business.\nFuture sales of our Ordinary Shares could reduce the market price of our Ordinary Shares.\nSubstantial sales of our Ordinary Shares on Nasdaq, may cause the market price of our Ordinary Shares to decline. Sales by us or our security\nholders of substantial amounts of our Ordinary Shares, or the perception that these sales may occur in the future, could cause a reduction in the market\nprice of our Ordinary Shares.\nThe issuance of any additional Ordinary Shares or any securities that are exercisable for or convertible into Ordinary Shares, may have an\nadverse effect on the market price of our Ordinary Shares and will have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders and holders of Ordinary Shares.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a public company.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer both have experience managing a public company, interacting with public company\ninvestors and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. However, our management team, as a whole, has limited\nexperience working for a public company and may not be able to successfully or efficiently manage the transition to being a public company subject to\nsignificant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors.\nThese new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from our senior management, particularly from our chief executive officer, and\ncould divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and\nfinancial condition.\n19\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 25\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nOur articles of association provide that, unless we consent to an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the\nexclusive forum for resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, which could limit our shareholders\nability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us, our directors, shareholders, or other employees. In addition, the agreements governing the\nWarrants provide that disputes shall be brought in the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, and that a\nclaim under the U.S. federal securities laws may be made in any federal district court.\nSection 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for U.S. federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly,\nboth U.S. state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of\ninconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our articles of association provide that, unless we consent in writing to\nthe selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint\nasserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty\ncreated by the Exchange Act, and our shareholders cannot and will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws\nand the rules and regulations thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum provision. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest\nin any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provision of our articles of association.\nSimilarly, the agreement governing the Warrants provide that, and by owning Warrants investors agree that, all legal proceedings concerning the\ninterpretations, enforcement and defense of the transactions contemplated by the Warrant (whether brought against a party hereto or their respective\naffiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members, employees or agents) shall be commenced exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting\nin the City of New York, irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York, Borough of\nManhattan for the adjudication of any such dispute and irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not\npersonally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is improper or is an inconvenient venue for such proceeding.\nThe warrant agent agreement has similar provisions with respect to the Company and the warrant agent. Each of the agreement governing the Warrants\nand the warrant agent agreement provide that the foregoing provisions do not limit or restrict the federal district court in which a party may bring a claim\nunder the U.S. federal securities laws.\nHowever, the enforceability of similar forum provisions (including exclusive federal forum provisions for actions, suits, or proceedings asserting\na cause of action arising under the Securities Act) in other companies organizational documents and similar agreements has been challenged in legal\nproceedings, and there is uncertainty as to whether courts would enforce the exclusive forum provision in our articles of association or the agreements\ngoverning the Warrants. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in our articles of association or the agreements governing the\nWarrants to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions,\nwhich could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlthough we believe the exclusive forum provision benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of U.S. federal securities\nlaws, the Israeli Companies Law, 1999, or the Companies Law, or New York law, as applicable, in the types of lawsuits to which they apply, such\nexclusive forum provision may limit a shareholders ability to bring a claim in the judicial forum of their choosing for disputes with us or any of our\ndirectors, shareholders, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims against us and our current and former\ndirectors, shareholders, officers, or other employees.\nIf securities or industry analysts either do not publish research about us or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our\nmarket, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Ordinary Shares adversely, the trading price or trading volume of our Ordinary\nShares could decline.\nThe trading market for our Ordinary Shares will be influenced in part by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish\nabout us, our business, our market or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts initiate research with an unfavorable rating or downgrade our\nOrdinary Shares, provide a more favorable recommendation about our competitors or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the\nmarket prices of our Ordinary Shares would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish\nreports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume of our Ordinary Shares to\ndecline.\n20\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 26\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay\nany dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, shareholders must rely on sales of their Ordinary Shares after price appreciation as the only way to\nrealize any future gains on their investment.\nFurthermore, to the extent that we pay any dividends in the future, the ability to offer fully franked dividends, i.e. dividends that come from\nalready taxed earnings, is contingent on making taxable profits in excess of accumulated losses. Taxable profits may be volatile, making the payment of\ndividends unpredictable.\nThe value and availability of franking credits to a shareholder will differ depending on the shareholders particular tax circumstances.\nShareholders should also be aware that the ability to use franking credits, either as a tax offset or to claim a refund after the end of the income year, will\ndepend on the individual tax position of each shareholder.\nOur investors ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, we may issue additional authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of ownership interests of our\npresent shareholders. Furthermore, we may issue equity awards to management, employees and other eligible persons in the future under our 2021 Option\nPlan. Additional Ordinary Shares issued by us in the future will dilute an investors investment in the Company. In addition, we may seek shareholder\napproval to increase the amount of the Companys authorized shares, which would create the potential for further dilution of current investors.\nThe market prices of our Ordinary Shares could be affected by our involvement in a possible, future litigation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in litigation disputes from time to time. Litigation disputes brought by third parties,\nincluding but not limited to intellectual property, distribution partners, customers, suppliers, business partners and employees may adversely impact the\nfinancial performance and industry standing of the business, in the case where the impact of legal proceedings is greater than or outside the scope of our\ninsurance. We are not currently involved in any litigation.\nPossible force majeure events could impact our operations and the market price of our Ordinary Shares.\nEvents may occur within or outside the United States and Israel that could impact on the American and/or Israeli economy, our operations and\nthe market price of our Ordinary Shares. These events include acts of terrorism, an outbreak of international hostilities, fires, floods, earthquakes, labor\nstrikes, civil wars, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease or other natural or manmade events or occurrences that can have an adverse effect on the\ndemand for our products and its ability to conduct business. While we seek to maintain insurance in accordance with industry practice to insure against\nthe risks it considers appropriate after consideration of our needs and circumstances, no assurance can be given as to our ability to obtain such insurance\ncoverage in the future at reasonable rates or that any coverage arranged will be adequate and available to cover any and all potential claims. The\noccurrence of an event that is not covered or fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\n21\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 27\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nAs a foreign private issuer we are permitted, and intend, to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of otherwise\napplicable SEC and Nasdaq requirements, which may result in less protection than is accorded to investors under rules applicable to domestic U.S.\nissuers.\nOur status as a foreign private issuer also exempts us from compliance with certain SEC laws and regulations and certain regulations of Nasdaq,\nincluding the proxy rules, the short-swing profits recapture rules, and certain governance requirements such as independent director oversight of the\nnomination of directors and executive compensation. In addition, we will not be required under the Exchange Act to file current reports and financial\nstatements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. domestic companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act and we will\ngenerally be exempt from filing quarterly reports with the SEC. Also, although the Companies Law requires us to disclose the annual compensation of\nour five most highly compensated senior officers on an individual basis (rather than on an aggregate basis), this disclosure will not be as extensive as that\nrequired of a U.S. domestic issuer. We intend to commence providing such disclosure, at the latest, in the annual proxy statement for our first annual\nmeeting of, which will be filed under cover of a report on Form 6-K. Furthermore, as a foreign private issuer, we are also not subject to the requirements\nof Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure) promulgated under the Exchange Act.\nThese exemptions and leniencies will reduce the frequency and scope of information and protections to which you are entitled as an investor.\nThe determination of foreign private issuer status is made annually on the last business day of an issuers most recently completed second fiscal\nquarter and, accordingly, the next determination will be made with respect to us on June 30, 2022. In the future, we would lose our foreign private issuer\nstatus if a majority of our shareholders, directors or management are U.S. citizens or residents and we fail to meet additional requirements necessary to\navoid loss of foreign private issuer status. The regulatory and compliance costs to us under U.S. securities laws as a U.S. domestic registrant may be\nsignificantly higher.\nWe may become a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the current taxable year or may become\none in any subsequent taxable year. There generally would be negative tax consequences for U.S. taxpayers that are holders of the Ordinary Shares if\nwe are or were to become a PFIC.\nBased on the projected composition of our income and valuation of our assets, we do not expect to be a PFIC for 2021, and we do not expect to\nbecome a PFIC in the future, although there can be no assurance in this regard. The determination of whether we are a PFIC is made on an annual basis\nand will depend on the composition of our income and assets from time to time. We will be treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any\ntaxable year in which either (1) at least 75% of our gross income is passive income or (2) on average at least 50% of our assets by value produce\npassive income or are held for the production of passive income. Passive income for this purpose generally includes, among other things, certain\ndividends, interest, royalties, rents and gains from commodities and securities transactions and from the sale or exchange of property that gives rise to\npassive income. Passive income also includes amounts derived by reason of the temporary investment of funds, including those raised in a public\noffering. In determining whether a non-U.S. corporation is a PFIC, a proportionate share of the income and assets of each corporation in which it owns,\ndirectly or indirectly, at least a 25% interest (by value) is taken into account. The tests for determining PFIC status are applied annually, and it is difficult\nto make accurate projections of future income and assets which are relevant to this determination. In addition, our PFIC status may depend in part on the\nmarket value of the Ordinary Shares. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we currently are not or will not become a PFIC in the future. If we are a\nPFIC in any taxable year during which a U.S. taxpayer holds the Ordinary Shares, such U.S. taxpayer would be subject to certain adverse U.S. federal\nincome tax rules. In particular, if the U.S. taxpayer did not make an election to treat us as a qualified electing fund, or QEF, or make a mark-to-\nmarket election, then excess distributions to the U.S. taxpayer, and any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the Ordinary Shares by the\nU.S. taxpayer: (1) would be allocated ratably over the U.S. taxpayers holding period for the Ordinary Shares; (2) the amount allocated to the current\ntaxable year and any period prior to the first day of the first taxable year in which we were a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income; and (3) the amount\nallocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year, and\nan interest charge for the deemed deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such other taxable year. In\naddition, if the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, determines that we are a PFIC for a year with respect to which we have determined that we\nwere not a PFIC, it may be too late for a U.S. taxpayer to make a timely QEF or mark-to-market election. U.S. taxpayers that have held the Ordinary\nShares during a period when we were a PFIC will be subject to the foregoing rules, even if we cease to be a PFIC in subsequent years, subject to\nexceptions for U.S. taxpayer who made a timely QEF or mark-to-market election. A U.S. taxpayer can make a QEF election by completing the relevant\nportions of and filing IRS Form 8621 in accordance with the instructions thereto. We do not intend to notify U.S. taxpayers that hold the Ordinary Shares\nif we believe we will be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year in order to enable U.S. taxpayers to consider whether to make a QEF election. In addition,\nwe do not intend to furnish such U.S. taxpayers annually with information needed in order to complete IRS Form 8621 and to make and maintain a valid\nQEF election for any year in which we or any of our subsidiaries are a PFIC. U.S. taxpayers that hold the Ordinary Shares are strongly urged to consult\ntheir tax advisors about the PFIC rules, including tax return filing requirements and the eligibility, manner, and consequences to them of making a QEF or\nmark-to-market election with respect to the Ordinary Shares in the event that we are a PFIC.\n22\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 28\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We\nmay be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of managements attention\nand resources, which could seriously hurt our business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf we are not able to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, technical and marketing personnel, we may not be able to implement our business\nmodel successfully.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management. We are highly dependent upon\nour senior management as well as other employees and consultants. Our management team must be able to act decisively to apply and adapt our business\nmodel in the rapidly changing markets in which we will compete. In addition, we will rely upon technical employees or third-party contractors to\neffectively establish, manage and grow our business. Consequently, we believe that our future viability will depend largely on our ability to attract and\nretain highly skilled managerial, sales and technical personnel. In order to do so, we may need to pay higher compensation or fees to our employees or\nconsultants than currently expected and such higher compensation payments may have a negative effect on our operating results. Competition for\nexperienced, high-quality personnel in the digital video and data transfer technologies field is intense. We may not be able to hire or retain the necessary\npersonnel to implement our business strategy. Our failure to hire and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms could impair our ability to develop new\nproducts and services and manage our business effectively.\nIf we engage in future acquisitions or strategic partnerships, this may increase our capital requirements, dilute our shareholders, cause us to incur\ndebt or assume contingent liabilities, and subject us to other risks.\nWe may evaluate various acquisition opportunities and strategic partnerships, including licensing or acquiring complementary products,\nintellectual property rights, technologies or businesses. Any potential acquisition or strategic partnership may entail numerous risks, including:\nincreased operating expenses and cash requirements;\nthe assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities;\nthe issuance of our equity securities;\n23\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 29\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nassimilation of operations, intellectual property and products of an acquired company, including difficulties associated with integrating new\npersonnel;\nthe diversion of our managements attention from our existing product programs and initiatives in pursuing such a strategic merger or\nacquisition;\nretention of key employees, the loss of key personnel and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships;\nrisks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and their existing products\nor product candidates and marketing approvals; and\nour inability to generate revenue from acquired technology and/or products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition\nor even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nWe are subject to certain U.S. and foreign anticorruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions and other trade laws and regulations. We\ncan face serious consequences for violations.\nAmong other matters, U.S. and foreign anticorruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions and other trade laws and regulations,\nwhich are collectively referred to as Trade Laws, prohibit companies and their employees, agents, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, contractors and\nother partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting or receiving, directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything\nelse of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. Violations of Trade Laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties,\nimprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other\nconsequences. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals,\nuniversities and other organizations. We also expect our non-U.S. activities to increase over time. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal\nactivities of our personnel, agents or partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities.\nOur business and operations might be adversely affected by security breaches, including any cybersecurity incidents.\nWe depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems, and those of our consultants, contractors\nand vendors, which we use for, among other things, sensitive company data, including our intellectual property, financial data and other proprietary\nbusiness information.\nWhile certain of our operations have business continuity and disaster recovery plans and other security measures intended to prevent and\nminimize the impact of IT-related interruptions, our IT infrastructure and the IT infrastructure of our consultants, contractors and vendors are vulnerable\nto damage from cyberattacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, electrical failures and natural disasters or other catastrophic events. We could\nexperience failures in our information systems and computer servers, which could result in an interruption of our normal business operations and require\nsubstantial expenditure of financial and administrative resources to remedy. System failures, accidents or security breaches can cause interruptions in our\noperations and can result in a material disruption of our targeted phage therapies, product candidates and other business operations. To the extent that any\ndisruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary\ninformation, we could incur regulatory investigations and redresses, penalties and liabilities and the development of our product candidates could be\ndelayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nEven though we believe we carry commercially reasonable business interruption and liability insurance, we might suffer losses as a result of\nbusiness interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies or for which we do not have coverage. For example, we are not\ninsured against terrorist attacks or cyberattacks. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a significant negative impact on our operations and\nfinancial results. Moreover, any such event could delay the development of our product candidates.\n24\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 30\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nSales of a significant number of our Ordinary Shares in the public markets or significant short sales of our Ordinary Shares, or the perception that\nsuch sales could occur, could depress the market price of our Ordinary Shares and impair our ability to raise capital.\nSales of a substantial number of our Ordinary Shares or other equity-related securities in the public markets, could depress the market price of\nour Ordinary Shares. If there are significant short sales of our Ordinary Shares, the price decline that could result from this activity may cause the share\nprice to decline more so, which, in turn, may cause long holders of the Ordinary Shares to sell their shares, thereby contributing to sales of Ordinary\nShares in the market. Such sales also may impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities in the future at a time and price\nthat our management deems acceptable, if at all.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they adversely\nchange their recommendations or publish negative reports regarding our business or the Ordinary Shares, our share price and trading volume could\ndecline.\nThe trading market for the Ordinary Shares will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about\nus, our business, our market or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will\ncover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding the Ordinary Shares,\nor provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our Ordinary Shares would likely decline. If any analyst who\nmay cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in\nturn could cause the price of our Ordinary Shares or trading volume to decline.\nITEM 4.

The use of unmanned platforms, especially, has expanded\nsignificantly over the past several years, and has continued to advance and evolve at an ever-rapid pace.\n28\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 34\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nAccording to ResearchAndMarkets April 15, 2020 Newswire, the video surveillance market is estimated at $34 billion in 2019, and is projected\nto reach $82 billion by 2025, growing at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 15.88% during that period. Additionally, according to\nResearchAndMarkets, the autonomous aerial vehicle market alone is estimated at $19.3 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $45.8 billion by 2025,\ngrowing a CAGR of 15.5% during that period. According to research by AlliedMarketResearch from April 2021, the video analytics market size was\nvalued at $4.1 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $21.7 billion in 2027, registering a CAGR of 22.7% from 2020 to 2027.\nUnmanned platforms, equipped with video, communication and artificial intelligence analysis payloads, or Payload, are constantly being used\nfor remote control, scene live monitoring, inspection, situational awareness and intelligence gathering in various ways, and the ubiquitous use and growth\nof the market has created the need for creative technological solutions in all areas relating to these platforms, with high-fidelity video and audio systems,\nonboard sensors and data processing units making the greatest gains. As new commercial functions for unmanned platforms continue to emerge, Payloads\nwill also need to continue improving incrementally and become more stable, durable, and reliable, while their associated management software will\ncontinue to advance.\nAs such, factors like the need for increasing operational efficiency, reduced human intervention, and growth in sheer activities around the world\nand in new market segments, are at the forefront of the constant drive for new advancements and improvements, especially in the following areas:\nHigh Fidelity, Streaming and Latency. Due to the growing need and demand for greater fidelity in video and audio, Payloads are now\nrequired to stream live video anywhere in the world at extremely high resolutions and high video quality. As unmanned platforms are more\ncommonly used in defense and other real-time, high-risk scenarios, the industry is in constant search for technological solutions that will\nallow a user to operate the unmanned platform, stream and analyze video online from their location, in real time, with minimum to no delay\nor latency, without compromising video and audio integrity and resolution.\nSize. The continuous need to create miniature unmanned platforms, which can easily avoid detection and allow maneuver indoors and entry\nto areas which are difficult for humans to access, indicate that, in general, Payloads will continue to decrease in size and miniaturize. As the\ntrend of miniaturization continues, the market will constantly be searching for technical solutions which will allow the Payloads to become\nsmaller and smaller, all the while maintaining or increasing their operational capabilities. For example, our Mars V300 is similar to the size\nof a quarter.\n29\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 35\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nWeight. Similarly, as Payloads are more and more commonly mounted on increasingly smaller unmanned platforms, as well as being\nmounted on humans and animals in the field, Payloads will need to continue decreasing in weight. As this trend continues, the market will\nconstantly be searching for technical solutions which will allow the Payloads to become lighter without decreasing or jeopardizing their\noperational capabilities or functionalities. Weight may also have a significant influence on flight mission duration, which is also critical\nfactor in mission planning.\nDesign. As new markets and industries begin to adopt unmanned platform technology for various uses, innovative Payload design has been\nrelied upon to provide new Payload structures to enhance operations. Generally, the development of multi-modal unmanned platforms that\ncan operate in mixed environments (day, night, air, land, water surface, underwater) are taking hold and there is a steady increase in demand\nfor Payloads that can similarly operate in several environments simultaneously. Additionally, the wide use of unmanned platforms, which\noften involve the operation of various types of platforms simultaneously for the completion of the same task, all sharing data from the\nPayloads between them, requires design solutions aimed at efficient and continuous communication across various platforms.\nRange and Endurance. The need to operate over increasingly longer distance, beyond visual line of sight and for long range and long-\nlasting missions will continue to drive an increase in operational range while maintaining and/or increasing endurance capabilities. New\nPayload designs and advancements in power supplies will be required to allow Payloads to operate effectively for longer periods and the\nindustry is heavily invested in improving features relating to range and endurance.\nVideo encoding. Video encoding has faced evolving standards (i.e., MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.264, HEVC) that require an increasing amount of\ncomputing power to realize increasing quality and efficiency. At the same time, the raw size of video has increased through standard\ndefinition, high definition, and now 4K and 8K resolutions. Both evolutions have created an exponential need for computing power to\nachieve real time (low latency) performance.\nSensors. The demand for greater capability in onboard sensors and processors for unmanned platforms is also increasing the need for smart\ndesign of the Payloads, so that numerous sensors can be included and incorporated in the Payload and analytics from various sensors can be\ndelivered to users in real time, allowing for real time decision making, all without compromising or dramatically affecting the platforms\nperformance, size, weight and cost.\nAutonomy and Processing. As the need to use more and more unmanned platforms in various industries and functions grows, so does the\nneed to create both platforms and Payloads which can operate autonomously (either semi autonomously or fully autonomously) while\nmaintaining their operational capabilities (edge computing). As the need for autonomous platforms increases, so does the reliance on\nPayload features and capabilities as the autonomy of the platform itself often requires the use of Payload systems (such as sensors and\nprocessing) in order to enable functions, such as adaptive maneuverability, object sense-and-avoidance, object tracking, and waypoint\nnavigation.\n30\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 36\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nOur Core Products\nWe offer ready-made, off the shelf products, available for purchase through our sales representatives, which are also customizable according to\nour customers specifications and needs and typically sold through our commercial partners.

As such we are taking steps to expand our activities abroad and strive to enter\ninto agreements or arrangements with new business partners in various world-wide markets.\nWe intend to continue concentrate our market penetration efforts into the U.S. market, including recruitment of additional sales and marketing\npersonnel either located in the U.S. or with U.S. orientation, participation in various professional expos, conventions and exhibitions and entering into\nagreements or arrangements with distributors in the U.S. markets and starting collaborative relationships with other defense, HLS and commercial entities\nfor the development of new customized products.\nMoreover, we intend to continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to improve and build on our slate of\nexisting products, and strive to develop new cutting-edge products in sync with new market technological developments, in order to maintain our\ninnovative position and competitive advantage in the ever-evolving market.\nWe intend to further advance our breakthrough technologies and commercialization efforts. To achieve these objectives, we plan to:\nengage with additional suppliers and service providers in order to improve and streamline our products process and supply chains;\nincrease marketing and sales activities, concentrating on specific target markets;\nincrease participation in professional expos, conventions and exhibitions;\nengage with distributors and systems integrators; and\nestablish partnerships and collaborations with strategic customers and entities in the autonomous vehicle, defense, HLS and home security\nmarkets.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property strategies, including patents and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary\ntechnology and intellectual property that includes: (1) proprietary know-how; (2) patents; (3) registered designs (also known in some jurisdictions as\ndesign patents); and (4) trademarks.\nOur strategy is mostly relying on know-how and confidential information as means to maintain a proprietary and competitive position in the\nmarket that is requiring complex and high-performance video and audio processing, streaming, recording and debriefing functionalities implemented for\nunmanned platforms and alike. As to most of such intellectual property, the Company prefers not to register it as patents so as to avoid disclosure of\nconfidential and proprietary data that may jeopardize its intellectual property by enabling competitors to learn of our non-patentable know-how (that will\nhave to be disclosed as part of the registration of the patents for patentable know-how) and use it to their advantage. We believe that our know-how and\nexpertise will permit us to continue to keep ahead of the competition in the design of new products. However, in view of the Companys expected growth\nand expanding the target markets, we seek to protect some of our innovations also by patents.\n35\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 41\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nIn April 2021, we filed a patent application in Israel and currently intend to file additional patents in Israel and then file for an international\nrecognition. Pursuant to international conventions, such as the Paris Convention, an application made in Israel can be used to establish a priority date for\napplications subsequently made in other countries. For example, the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or the PCT, allows for an international application to be\nmade claiming priority from an application made in a participating country. Under the PCT, a patent application must be made in each country where\npatent protection is sought and we filed for PCT in April 2022, using the priority date of the application filed in Israel.\nWe have entered into, and intend to continue to enter into, customary confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, customers,\nservice providers and vendors that generally require that any confidential or proprietary information developed by us or on our behalf be kept confidential\nincluding, but not limited to, information related to our proprietary manufacturing process.\nAs of the date of this annual report, we:\nown extensive proprietary know-how, which is embedded in our product design, including, for example, modular universal infrastructure\n(firmware) ubiquitous for the entire range of our products and enabling low-effort customization for a variety of applications; or expertise in\nmechanical and thermo-design enabling products operation in extreme environments and conditions (Our technology was tested and found\nto be fully operational in extreme temperature range, thermal vacuum, vibrations, shock absorbency etc. as part of our collaboration with\nIsraeli SpaceIL and its implementation in the Israeli lunar vehicle  Beresheet;\nhave several patentable applications that we contemplate filing in the next 12 months, and which, at the current stage of research and\npreparation, we believe are viable. These include, for example: on-the-fly setting of encoding parameters in accordance with collected\nmetadata;\nhave one pending patent application for enhanced forward error correction for video streaming;\nown three Israeli Trademarks  Neptune by Maris (Israeli Trademark No. 337301), XtremeView (Israeli Trademark No. 337303), and\nMercury by Maris (Israeli Trademark No. 337302); and\nhave one pending trademark application for Maris-Tech Ltd.\nNo assurance can be made that any patent or trademark will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent or trademark applications or\nwith respect to any patent or trademark applications filed by us in the future. There is also a significant risk that any issued patents or trademarks will\nhave substantially narrower claims than those being sought in our applications. Additionally, while we regularly enter into confidentiality and\nnondisclosure agreements with our employees and other third parties to limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information and know how, it is\npossible that misappropriation and disclosure, will nevertheless occur.\nCompetition\nThe video surveillance and communication platform market in which we operate is characterized by intense competition, constant innovation\nand advancement, and evolving technological needs. Furthermore, since we compete with several well-established companies, we invest significant\nefforts to obtain technological advantages at the same time as we strive to offer a more cost-effective solution than the ones offered by our competitors.\n36\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 42\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nWe are constantly striving to improve our competitive status in the market by:\nentering into agreements or arrangements with large and high-level customers in the industry, which we believe enhances our status and\nreputation in the markets in which we operate and provides opportunities to build on existing relationships and enter into new agreements or\narrangements with new customers;\nentering into agreements or arrangements with distributors and technological partners in order to strengthen our position in existing markets\nto penetrate new markets; and\nproviding high level development and support services to existing customers, to promote customer retention, and encourage our customers\nto rely on us and continue using our services for future projects\nOur Competitive Advantages\nArmed with our various products and designs, we believe we possess industry-recognized unique combination of knowledge and features.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales to existing and new customers mainly in Israel.\nCertain of our products have reached maturity and validation among our customers, and as a result our sales increased significantly compared to\nprevious years.\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues for the period ended December 31, 2021 was $1,106,447 representing an increase of $605,751 or 121 %, compared to\n$500,696 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the significant increase in the Companys sales, while maintaining\nsubstantially similar gross profit rates.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses for the period ended December 31, 2021 were $706,021 representing a decrease of $75,396, or 10%,\ncompared to $781,417 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily a result of certain of the Companys products reaching a\nmaturity.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses totaled $241,114 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $218,563, compared to $22,551 for the\nperiod ended December 31, 2020. The increase is mainly attributable to the significant increase in the Companys sales, expenses related to the\nrecruitment of senior key personnel and other marketing-related expenses, such as attending an exhibition.\n43\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 49\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses totaled $595,074 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $520,905, compared to $74,169\nfor the period ended December 31, 2020. The increase is mainly attributable to the increase in expenses related to the recruitment of senior key personnel\nand professional services expenses in connection with the IPO.\nOperating Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing, our operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $572,901, compared to an operating loss of $390,951\nfor the period ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $181,950, or 47%.\nFinancial Expense and Income\nFinancial expense and income consist of bank fees and other transactional costs, exchange rate differences and the revaluation of outstanding\nwarrants to purchase Ordinary Shares.\nWe recognized net financial expenses of $251,323 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net financial expenses of $249,392 for\nthe period ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to revaluation of outstanding warrants.\nTotal Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing, our total loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $824,224 compared to $640,343 for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2020, an increase of $183,881, or 29%.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected businesses, economies and\nfinancial markets worldwide, placed constraints on the operations of businesses, decreased consumer mobility and activity, and caused significant\neconomic volatility in the United States, Israel and international capital markets. We have followed guidance issued by the U.S. and Israeli governments\nand the other local governments in territories in which we operate to protect our employees. As such, we have implemented work from home where\npossible, minimized face-to-face meetings and utilized video conference as much as possible and adhered to social distancing rules at our facilities while\neliminating of all international travel, which required us to use local representatives to handle presentations and demonstrations for oversees customers.\nAs a result, we have experienced some difficulties in employee ability to efficiently collaborate to meet our customer needs, a difficulty in our efforts to\nrecruit and hire qualified personnel during this time, and have recorded a minor increase in revenue in 2020 compared to 2019, both due to the lockdown\nand restrictions, and our governmental customers postponing or being hesitant of making future financial commitments due to the need to put response to\nthe pandemic at the forefront.\nIn addition, and most importantly, the electronics components shortage crisis, a unique result of the COVID-19 pandemic which affected our\nmarket segment, has increased the lead time to obtain and the purchase prices of the component parts required for certain of our products, which has also\nnegatively impacted the delivery time of our products to customers and our revenues and profitability. As long as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the\ncomponents lead time may be longer than normal and shortage in components may continue or get worse. Therefore, the Company maintains a\ncomprehensive network of world-wide suppliers. In order to mitigate such risks, in cases where certain components are purchased from single source\nmanufacturers, the Company has adjusted and modified it designs based on different components from different suppliers, to allow for more versatility\nand flexibility. Our financial condition and results of operations were not negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the year ended December\n31, 2021.\n44\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 50\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nWe cannot predict the other future potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business or operations, and there is no guarantee that\nany near-term trends in our results of operations will continue, particularly if the COVID-19 pandemic and the adverse consequences thereof return.\nAdditional waves of infections, a continuation of the current environment, or any further adverse impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could\nfurther impact employment rates and the economy, affecting our consumer base and divert consumers discretionary income to other uses, including for\nessential items. These events could impact our cash flows, results of operations and financial conditions and heighten many of the other risks described in\nthis annual report.\nB. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nSince our inception through December 31, 2021, we have funded our operations principally with approximately $1,078,808 from the issuance of\nOrdinary Shares, approximately $1,320,087 from the issuance of Preferred Shares and warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares and $1,088,250 from long-\nterm loans from shareholders. As of December 31, 2021, we had $785 in cash and cash equivalents.\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated.\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\nU.S. dollars 2021 2020\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (875,002) $ (418,490)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities (29,424) (33,543)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 899,181 455,360\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (5,245) $ 3,327\nWe have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception and have relied on our ability to fund our operations\nprimarily through proceeds from sales of Ordinary Shares and long-term loans from shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had a working capital deficit of $994,850 and $841,901, respectively; an accumulated deficit of\n$4,504,181 and $3,679,957, respectively; and negative cash flow from operating activity of $875,002 and $418,490 for the years ended December 31,\n2021 and 2020, respectively. We anticipate that such losses will continue until our products reach commercial profitability. If we are unable to\nsuccessfully commercialize our product candidates and reach profitability or obtain sufficient future financing through debt or issuance of equity, we will\nbe required to delay some of our planned research and development programs.\nOur backlog as of January 1, 2022 was approximately $608,000 and our backlog as of April 28, 2022 was approximately $1,202,000, of which\napproximately all of it expected to be delivered and be recognized as revenues by the end of 2022.. Since January 1, 2022, our backlog increased\nsignificantly compared to previous years. We define backlog as the accumulation of all pending orders with a later fulfillment date for which revenue has\nnot been recognized and we consider valid. Our order backlog is comprised of executed purchase orders from high rated leading customers in the defense\nindustries, also referred to as triple A customers, customers with which we have had long-standing relationships and governmental agencies. The\nincrease in backlog orders and sales is a result of the Companys products reaching maturity and validation among our customers. Our management\nestimates that such sales will continue in the coming year. However, because revenue will not be recognized until we have fulfilled our obligations to a\ncustomer, there may be a significant amount of time between executing an agreement or purchase order with a customer and delivery of the product to the\ncustomer and revenue recognition. In addition, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future earnings (see Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our\nBusiness, Industry, Operations and Financial Condition  Amounts included in backlog may not result in actual revenue and are an uncertain indicator\nof our future earnings for further information).\nIn addition, on March 24, 2021, we entered into a share purchase agreement, which was amended and restated on April 27, 2021 and August 4,\n2021, as amended and restated, the March 2021 SPA, pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 489,812 Preferred Shares, to certain investors, or the\nMarch 2021 Investors, in a private placement, or the March 2021 Private Placement, for aggregate gross proceeds of $1.5 million. These Preferred Shares\nwere converted into an equal number of Ordinary Shares in connection with the closing of the IPO. The March 2021 Investors also received warrants to\npurchase up to an aggregate of 489,812 Ordinary Shares. Such warrants will be exercisable until March 24, 2026, at an exercise price of $6.1248 per\nOrdinary Share.\n45\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 51\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nUpon the closing of our IPO in February 2022, we received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $17.8 million, before deducting\nunderwriting discounts and commissions and before offering expenses. Therefore, based on managements assessment, we believe the Company has\nsufficient liquidity to satisfy its obligations over the next 12 months. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the\nCompany will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary\ncourse of business.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $875,002 during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net cash used in operating activities\nof $418,490 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to net loss for the year\nended December 31, 2021, of $824,224, an increase of $443,944 in trade receivables due to completion of large orders and revenue recognition before the\nyear end, and an increase of $140,417 in inventory due to fulfillment of outstanding orders during the year, partially offset by an increase of $435,749 in\ntrade payables and other current liabilities as a result of future payments that should be made to suppliers and other service providers with respect to the\nIPO.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used by investing activities was $29,424 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of\n$33,543 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is mainly attributable to investment in severance funds.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $899,181 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to net cash provided by financing\nactivities of $455,360 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is mainly attributable to issuance of Preferred Shares and warrants for\naggregate net proceeds of $1,320,087, offset by deferred issuance costs of $621,607.\nFinancial Arrangements\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from sales of Ordinary Shares, Preferred Shares, warrants and\nlong-term loans from banks and shareholders.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received long term loans from banks in total amount of NIS 0.65 million\n(approximately $0.18 million), which loans carry an annual interest of 3.1%,\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received long term loans from banks in the total amount of NIS 1.5 million\n(approximately $0.46 million), which loans carry annual interest rates of 5.2%-5.8%%.\nSince our inception, Israel Bar, our Chief Executive Officer, a director and our largest shareholder, and Joseph Gottlieb, our other director and\nsecond largest shareholder, have provided loans to us in an aggregate amount of NIS 7,513,887 (approximately $2,282,364), or the Shareholders Loan.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued an aggregate of 3,084,664 Ordinary Shares as consideration for the conversion of NIS 3,756,944\n(approximately $1,078,808) owed to Mr. Bar and Mr. Gottlieb.\nOn March 24, 2021, we issued an aggregate of 489,812 Preferred Shares to the March 2021 Investors for aggregate gross proceeds of $1.5\nmillion pursuant to the March 2021 SPA. Following the completion of the IPO, all Preferred Shares were automatically converted into 489,812 Ordinary\nShares.\n46\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 52\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nThe March 2021 Investors also received warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 489,812 Ordinary Shares. Such warrants are exercisable until\nMarch 24, 2026, at an exercise price of $6.1248 per Ordinary Share.\nOn May 9, 2021, we entered into a loan facility agreement, or the Loan Facility Agreement, effective as of January 1, 2021, with Israel Bar, our\nChief Executive Officer, director and our largest shareholder, and Joseph Gottlieb, another director and our second largest shareholder. Pursuant to the\nLoan Facility Agreement, the outstanding amount under the Shareholders Loan, to be paid to Mr. Bar in a total amount of NIS 2,459,958.88\n(approximately $755,393) and to Mr. Gottlieb, in a total amount of NIS 1,296,985.55 (approximately $393,962), bear no interest and shall be due and\npayable in 24 equal monthly payments, commencing on the second anniversary following the IPO. Pursuant to the Loan Facility Agreement, if an initial\npublic offering is not completed by December 31, 2021, then the outstanding amount shall be repaid pursuant to the available free cash of the Company,\ntaking into account expected expenditures in the three months following partial or full payment, and in any event not prior to December 31, 2022. We\nalso agreed to reimburse Mr. Bar and Mr. Gottlieb for any costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement of the Loan Facility\nAgreement, if required.\nOn June 16, 2021, we executed a credit line, providing us with a line of credit, or the Credit Line, in the aggregate amount of up to NIS 400,000\n(approximately $121,501) from Bank Mizrahi Tefahot. Mr. Israel Bar, our Chief Executive Officer and director provided a personal guarantee to the\nCredit Line.\nWe have also issued several debentures, including: (i) a debenture issued on December 31, 2018 to Bank Mizrahi Tefahot for all factory\nequipment, monetary assets property and rights including fruits of any kind with no exception, and first class pledge on unissued capital and the\nCompanys reputation including funds and insurance rights; (ii) a debenture issued on September 8, 2020 to Bank Leumi for all outstanding and future\nfunds as well as all considerations, fruits, incomes and rights, at Companys bank account in Bank Leumi up to the amount of NIS 300,000\n(approximately $90,917); and (3) a debenture issued on July 6, 2021 to Bank Mizrahi Tefahot to guarantee Companys credit and all funds and deposits\nin Company account up to the amount of NIS 200,000 (approximately $60,611).\nIn February 2022, the Company repaid its liabilities to banks in the total amount of approximately $1 million. As a result, personal guarantees\nand collateral securing certain of those loans were released.\nOn December 23, 2021, we entered into a loan agreement with Yaad Consulting and Management Services (1995) Ltd., one of our minority\nshareholders, pursuant to which it loaned to the Company $200,000, at an annual interest rate equal to 4% and such loan with any accrued interest is due\nand payable (i) in full two business days following the receipt of funds in Israel from the closing of an initial public offering of the Company or (ii) if no\ninitial public offering is closed by December 31, 2024, in three (3) equal annual installments beginning January 1, 2025. The loan was repaid in full in\nFebruary 2022.\nOn February 4, 2022, we closed the IPO of (i) 3,690,477 Units, each consisting of one Ordinary Shares, and one warrant to purchase one\nordinary share, and (ii) 10,000 Pre-Funded Units, each consisting of one Pre-Funded Warrants to one ordinary share and one Warrant, to those purchasers\nwhose purchase of Units in the IPO would otherwise result in the purchaser, together with its affiliates and certain related parties, beneficially owning\nmore than 4.99% (or 9.99% in certain circumstances) of the outstanding Ordinary Shares immediately following the consummation of the IPO. The Units\nwere sold at an IPO price of $4.20 per Unit and the Pre-Funded Units were sold at an IPO price of $4.199 per Pre-Funded Unit. The Warrants have an\nexercise price of $5.25 per Ordinary Share and may be exercised until February 4, 2027 and the Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price of $0.001\nper Ordinary Share. In addition, the Company also issued and sold 65,247 Ordinary Shares at a price of $4.199, 478,324 Pre-Funded Warrants at a price\nof $4.198 per Pre-Funded Warrant and 543,571 Warrants at a price of $0.001 per Warrant pursuant to the partial exercise of the over-allotment option and\nissued 488,324 Ordinary Shares pursuant to the exercise of the 488,324 Pre-Funded Warrants issued in the IPO at an exercise price of $0.001 per\nOrdinary Share.

We have incurred losses and generated negative cash flows from operations since our inception.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents were $785. We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31,\n2021, including the net proceeds from the IPO will be sufficient to fund our current operations for the next twelve months. In addition, our operating\nplans may change as a result of many factors that may currently be unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Our\nfuture capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nthe progress and costs of our research and development activities;\nthe costs of manufacturing our products;\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\nthe potential costs of contracting with third parties to provide marketing and distribution services for us or for building such capacities\ninternally; and\nthe magnitude of our general and administrative expenses.\nC. Research and development, patents and licenses, etc.\nFor a description of our research and development programs and the amounts that we have incurred over the last two years pursuant to those\nprograms, please see Item 5.A. Operating Results Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses, net and Item 5.A. Results of\nOperations Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2021, to the year ended December 31, 2020 Research and Development Expenses, net.\nD. Trend information\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted companies in Israel and around the world, and as its trajectory remains highly uncertain, we cannot\npredict the duration and severity of the outbreak and its containment measures. Further, we cannot predict impacts, trends and uncertainties involving the\npandemics effects on economic activity, the size of our labor force, our third-party partners, our investments in marketable securities, and the extent to\nwhich our revenue, income, profitability, liquidity, or capital resources may be materially and adversely affected. See also Item 3.D.  Risk Factors We\nface business disruption and related risks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a material adverse effect on our business and results of\noperations.\nE. Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe describe our significant accounting policies more fully in Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report. We\nbelieve that the accounting policies described below and in Note 2 to our financial statements are critical in order to fully understand and evaluate our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. At the time of the preparation of the financial statements, our management\nis required to use estimates, evaluations, and assumptions which affect the application of the accounting policy and the amounts reported for assets,\nobligations, income, and expenses. Any estimates and assumptions are continually reviewed. The changes to the accounting estimates are credited during\nthe period in which the change to the estimate is made.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe determine the appropriate revenue recognition for our contracts with customers by analyzing the type, terms and conditions of each contract.\nWe classify the revenue components as products according to the attributes of the underlying components.\nOur contract payment terms typically range between 30 and 120 days. We assess collectability based on several factors, including collection\nhistory.\nInventory Provision\nInventory write-offs are provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items or technological obsolescence. Reserves for potentially excess\nand obsolete inventory are made based on management's analysis of inventory levels, future sales forecasts. Once established, the original cost of our\ninventory less the related inventory reserve represents the new cost basis of such products.\n48\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 54\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nUse of estimates in the preparation of financial statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Our management believes that the estimates, judgment and assumptions used are\nreasonable based upon information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgment and assumptions can affect reported amounts and\ndisclosures made. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nFinancial statement in U.S. dollars\nThe functional currency of our business is the U.S. dollar, since the dollar is the currency of the primary economic environment in which we\nhave operated and expects to continue to operate in the foreseeable future.\nTransactions and balances denominated in dollars are presented at their original amounts. Transactions and balances denominated in foreign\ncurrencies have been re-measured to dollars in accordance with the provisions of ASC 830-10, Foreign Currency Translation.\nAll transaction gains and losses from re-measurement of monetary balance sheet items denominated in non-dollar currencies are reflected in the\nstatement of operations as financial income or expenses, as appropriate.\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Companys financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, short-term interest-bearing investments, accounts receivable,\nrestricted deposits for employee benefits, accounts payable and short-term and long-term loans.\nThe Company, in estimating fair value for financial instruments, determined that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade\nreceivables, short-term bank credit, trade payables and long-term loans from shareholders are equivalent are equivalent to, or approximate their fair value\ndue to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amounts of variable interest rate long-term loans are equivalent or approximate to their\nfair value as they bear interest at approximate market rates. The liabilities include long-term loan, that does not bear any interest, but taking into account\nthe schedule of its maturities, its amount and the relatively current low market rates, the difference between its carrying amount and its fair value is\ninsignificant.\nITEM 6.

All of these agreements contain customary provisions\nregarding noncompetition, confidentiality of information and assignment of inventions. However, the enforceability of the noncompetition provisions\nmay be limited under applicable law. In addition, we have entered into our standard form of indemnification agreement, in the form filed as an exhibit to\nthe registration statement of which this annual report forms a part, with each of our directors and members of our senior management. Each such\nindemnification agreement provides the indemnified person with indemnification to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law and up to a\ncertain amount, and to the extent that these liabilities are not covered by directors and officers insurance or other indemnification agreement. Insofar as\nindemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant, we have\nbeen advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.\nFor a description of the terms of our options and option plans, see Management  Share Option Plan below.\nService Agreements with Non-Executive Directors\nWe have entered into written service agreements with our director each of our director nominees. Such director service contracts set out the key\nterms and conditions of the directors appointment, including their compensation for services as members of the board of director, duties, rights and\nresponsibilities, time commitment and the board of directors expectations regarding involvement with committees of the board of directors.\nDifferences between the Companies Law and Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as related rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, require foreign private issuers, such as us, to comply\nwith various corporate governance practices. In addition, following the listing of the Ordinary Shares on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with the\nNasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules. Under those rules, we may elect to follow certain corporate governance practices permitted under the Companies\nLaw in lieu of compliance with corresponding corporate governance requirements otherwise imposed by the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules for U.S.\ndomestic issuers.\nIn accordance with Israeli law and practice and subject to the exemption set forth in Rule 5615 of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, we\nhave elected to follow the provisions of the Companies Law, rather than the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, with respect to the following\nrequirements:\nQuorum. While the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules require that the quorum for purposes of any meeting of the holders of a listed\ncompanys common voting stock, as specified in the companys bylaws, be no less than 33 1/3% of the companys outstanding common\nvoting stock, under Israeli law, a company is entitled to determine in its articles of association the number of shareholders and percentage of\nholdings required for a quorum at a shareholders meeting. The Companies Law provides that a quorum of two or more shareholders holding\nat least 25% of the voting rights in person or by proxy is required for commencement of business at a general meeting. However, the\nquorum set forth in our articles of association with respect to an adjourned meeting consists of at least one shareholders present in person or\nby proxy.\nNomination of our directors. Our directors are elected by the general meeting of our shareholders and, unless appointed for a shorter term,\nserve in office until the third annual general meeting after the general meeting in which such director was appointed, in which such later\nannual general meeting the directors will be brought for re-election or replacement. The nominations for directors, which are presented to\nour shareholders by our board of directors, are generally made by the board of directors itself, in accordance with the provisions of our\narticles of association and the Companies Law. Nominations need not be made by a nominating committee of our board of directors\nconsisting solely of independent directors, as required under the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules.\n53\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 59\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nCompensation of officers. Israeli law and our articles of association do not require that the independent members of our board of directors\n(or a compensation committee composed solely of independent members of our board of directors) determine an executive officers\ncompensation, as is generally required under the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules with respect to the chief executive officer and all other\nexecutive officers. Instead, compensation of executive officers is determined and approved by our compensation committee and our board\nof directors, and in certain circumstances by our shareholders, either in consistency with our office holder compensation policy or, in special\ncircumstances in deviation therefrom, taking into account certain considerations stated in the Companies Law (see Management  Board\nPractices  Approval of Related Party Transactions under Israeli Law for additional information).\nShareholder approval. We will seek shareholder approval for all corporate actions requiring such approval under the requirements of the\nCompanies Law, rather than seeking approval for corporation actions in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635. In particular, under this\nNasdaq listing rule, shareholder approval is generally required for: (i) an acquisition of shares/assets of another company that involves the\nissuance of 20% or more of the acquirers shares or voting rights or if a director, officer or 5% shareholder has greater than a 5% interest in\nthe target company or the consideration to be received; (ii) the issuance of shares leading to a change of control; (iii) adoption/amendment\nof equity compensation arrangements (although under the provisions of the Companies Law there is no requirement for shareholder\napproval for the adoption/amendment of the equity compensation plan); and (iv) issuances of 20% or more of the shares or voting rights\n(including securities convertible into, or exercisable for, equity) of a listed company via a private placement (and/or via sales by\ndirectors/officers/5% shareholders) if such equity is issued (or sold) at below the greater of the book or market value of shares. By contrast,\nunder the Companies Law, shareholder approval is required for, among other things: (i) transactions with directors concerning the terms of\ntheir service or indemnification, exemption and insurance for their service (or for any other position that they may hold at a company), for\nwhich approvals of the compensation committee, board of directors and shareholders are all required, (ii) extraordinary transactions with\ncontrolling shareholders of publicly held companies, which require the special approval, and (iii) terms of employment or other engagement\nof the controlling shareholder of us or such controlling shareholders relative, which require special approval. In addition, under the\nCompanies Law, a merger requires approval of the shareholders of each of the merging companies.\nApproval of Related Party Transactions. All related party transactions are approved in accordance with the requirements and procedures for\napproval of interested party acts and transaction as set forth in the Companies Law, which requires the approval of the audit committee, or\nthe compensation committee, as the case may be, the board of directors and shareholders, as may be applicable, for specified transactions,\nrather than approval by the audit committee or other independent body of our board of directors as required under the Nasdaq Stock Market\nListing Rules (see Management  Board Practices  Approval of Related Party Transactions under Israeli Law for additional\ninformation).\nAnnual Shareholders Meeting. As opposed to the Nasdaq listing Rule 5620(a), which mandates that a listed company hold its annual\nshareholders meeting within one year of the companys fiscal year-end, we are required, under the Companies Law, to hold an annual\nshareholder meeting each calendar year and within 15 months of the last annual shareholders meeting.\nDistribution of periodic reports to shareholders; proxy solicitation. As opposed to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which require\nlisted issuers to make such reports available to shareholders in one of a number of specific manners, Israeli law does not require us to\ndistribute periodic reports directly to shareholders, and the generally accepted business practice in Israel is not to distribute such reports to\nshareholders but to make such reports available through a public website. In addition to making such reports available on a public website,\nwe currently make our audited financial statements available to our shareholders at our offices and will only mail such reports to\nshareholders upon request. As a foreign private issuer, we are generally exempt from the SECs proxy solicitation rules.\n54\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 60\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nC. Board Practices\nIntroduction\nOur board of directors presently consists of five members. We believe that Amitay Weiss, Joseph Weiss and Naama Falach Avrahamy are\nindependent for purposes of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules and SEC rules and regulations. Our articles of association provide that unless\notherwise determined by the general meeting of shareholders, the number of directors serving on the board of directors will be no less than three and no\nmore than twelve, including External Directors, which will be elected if and as required under the Companies Law, as may be fixed from time to time by\nthe Board of Directors. Pursuant to the Companies Law, the management of our business is vested in our board of directors. Our board of directors may\nexercise all powers and may take all actions that are not specifically granted to our shareholders or to management. Our executive officers are responsible\nfor our day-to-day management and have individual responsibilities established by our board of directors. Our Chief Executive Officer is appointed by,\nand serves at the discretion of, our board of directors, subject to the employment agreement that we have entered into with him. All other executive\nofficers are appointed by our Chief Executive Officer. Their terms of employment are subject to the approval of the board of directors compensation\ncommittee and of the board of directors and are subject to the terms of any applicable employment agreements that we may enter into with them, and are\nsubject to the Companys Compensation Policy (as defined below), which the Company intends to bring for the approval of the Companys board of\ndirectors and the general meeting of shareholders.\nOur articles of association provide for a split of the board of directors into three classes with staggered three-year terms (excluding the External\nDirectors). At each annual general meeting of our shareholders, the election or re-election of directors following the expiration of the term of office of the\ndirectors of that class of directors will be for a term of office that expires on the third annual general meeting following such election or re-election, such\nthat each year the term of office of only one class of directors will expire. The director whom is to be retired and re-elected shall be the director that\nserved the longest period since its appointment or last re-election or, if more than one director served the longest time, or if a director who is not to be re-\nelected agrees to be re-elected, the meeting of the board of directors which sets the date and agenda for the annual general meeting (acting by a simple\nmajority) will decide which of such directors will be brought for re-election at the relevant general meeting.\nUnder the Companies Law, our board of directors must determine the minimum number of directors who are required to have accounting and\nfinancial expertise. In determining the number of directors required to have such expertise, our board of directors must consider, among other things, the\ntype and size of the company and the scope and complexity of its operations. Our board of directors has determined that the minimum number of\ndirectors of our company who are required to have accounting and financial expertise is one.\nThe board of directors must elect one director to serve as the chairman of the board of directors to preside at the meetings of the board of\ndirectors, and may also remove that director as chairman. Pursuant to the Companies Law, neither the chief executive officer nor any of his or her\nrelatives is permitted to serve as the chairman of the board of directors, and a company may not vest the chairman or any of his or her relatives with the\nchief executive officers authorities. In addition, a person who reports, directly or indirectly, to the chief executive officer may not serve as the chairman\nof the board of directors; the chairman may not be vested with authorities of a person who reports, directly or indirectly, to the chief executive officer;\nand the chairman may not serve in any other position in the company or a controlled company, but he or she may serve as a director or chairman of a\ncontrolled company. However, the Companies Law permits a companys shareholders to determine, for a period not exceeding three years from each\nsuch determination, that the chairman or his or her relative may serve as chief executive officer or be vested with the chief executive officers authorities,\nand that the chief executive officer or his or her relative may serve as chairman or be vested with the chairmans authorities. Such determination of a\ncompanys shareholders requires either: (1) the approval of at least a majority of the shares of those shareholders present and voting on the matter (other\nthan controlling shareholders and those having a personal interest in the determination) (shares held by abstaining shareholders shall not be considered);\nor (2) that the total number of shares opposing such determination does not exceed 2% of the total voting power in the company. Currently, we have a\nseparate chairman and chief executive officer.\nThe board of directors may, subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, delegate any or all of its powers to committees of the board, and it\nmay, from time to time, revoke such delegation or alter the composition of any such committees, subject to certain limitations. Unless otherwise expressly\nprovided by the board of directors, the committees shall not be empowered to further delegate such powers. The composition and duties of our audit\ncommittee, financial statement examination committee and compensation committee are described below.\nThe board of directors oversees how management monitors compliance with our risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the\nadequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by us. The board of directors is assisted in its oversight role by an internal\nauditor. The internal auditor undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to\nour audit committee.\n55\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 61\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nExternal Directors\nUnder the Companies Law, an Israeli company whose shares have been offered to the public or whose shares are listed for trading on a stock\nexchange in or outside of Israel is required to appoint at least two external directors, or External Directors, to serve on its board of directors. External\nDirectors must meet stringent standards of independence. As of the date hereof, Amitay Weiss and Naama Falach Avrahamy meet the criteria for external\ndirectors. However, the Company adopted the exemption for appointment of external directors, as further specified below.\nAccording to regulations promulgated under the Companies law, at least one of the external directors is required to have financial and\naccounting expertise, unless another member of the audit committee, who is an independent director under the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, has\nfinancial and accounting expertise, and the other external director or directors are required to have professional expertise. An external director may\nnot be appointed to an additional term unless: (1) such director has accounting and financial expertise; or (2) he or she has professional expertise, and\non the date of appointment for another term there is another external director who has accounting and financial expertise and the number of\naccounting and financial experts on the board of directors is at least equal to the minimum number determined appropriate by the board of directors.\nWe have determined that both Amitay Weiss and Naama Falach Avrahamy have accounting and financial expertise.\nA director with accounting and financial expertise is a director who, due to his or her education, experience and skills, possesses a high degree of\nproficiency in, and an understanding of, business  accounting matters and financial statements, such that he or she is able to understand the financial\nstatements of the company in depth and initiate a discussion about the manner in which financial data is presented. A director is deemed to have\nprofessional expertise if he or she holds an academic degree in certain fields or has at least five years of experience in certain senior positions.\nExternal directors are elected by a majority vote at a shareholders meeting, as long as either:\nat least a majority of the shares held by shareholders who are not controlling shareholders and do not have personal interest in the\nappointment (excluding a personal interest that did not result from the shareholders relationship with the controlling shareholder) have\nvoted in favor of the proposal (shares held by abstaining shareholders shall not be considered); or\nthe total number of shares voted by non-controlling shareholders and by shareholders who do not have a personal interest in the election of\nthe external director, against the election of the external director, does not exceed 2% of the aggregate voting rights of the company.\nThe term control is defined in the Companies Law as the ability to direct the activities of the company, other than by virtue of being an office\nholder. A shareholder is presumed to be a controlling shareholder if the shareholder holds (within the meaning of the Companies Law) 50% or more of\nthe voting rights in a company or has the right to appoint 50% or more of the directors of the company or its general manager. With respect to certain\nmatters, a controlling shareholder is deemed to include a shareholder that holds 25% or more of the voting rights in a public company if no other\nshareholder holds more than 50% of the voting rights in the company, but excludes a shareholder whose power derives solely from his or her position as a\ndirector of the company or from any other position with the company.\nThe Companies Law provides for an initial three-year term for an external director. Thereafter, an external director may be reelected by\nshareholders to serve in that capacity for up to two additional three-year terms, provided that:\n(1) his or her service for each such additional term is recommended by one or more shareholders holding at least one percent of the companys\nvoting rights and is approved at a shareholders meeting by a disinterested majority, where the total number of shares held by non-\ncontrolling, disinterested shareholders voting for such reelection exceeds two percent of the aggregate voting rights in the company and\nsubject to additional restrictions set forth in the Companies Law with respect to the affiliation of the external director nominee as described\nbelow;\n(2) his or her service for each such additional term is recommended by the board of directors and is approved at a shareholders meeting by the\nsame disinterested majority required for the initial election of an external director (as described above); or\n(3) the external director offered his or her service for each such additional term and was approved in accordance with the provisions of section\n(1) above.\nThe term of office for external directors for Israeli companies traded on certain foreign stock exchanges, including the Nasdaq Stock Market,\nmay be extended indefinitely in increments of additional three-year terms, in each case provided that the audit committee and the board of directors of the\ncompany confirm that, in light of the external directors expertise and special contribution to the work of the board of directors and its committees, the\nreelection for such additional period(s) is beneficial to the company, and provided that the external director is reelected subject to the same shareholder\nvote requirements as if elected for the first time (as described above). Prior to the approval of the reelection of the external director at a general\nshareholders meeting, the companys shareholders must be informed of the term previously served by him or her and of the reasons why the board of\ndirectors and audit committee recommended the extension of his or her term.\n56\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 62\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nThe Companies Law provides that a person is not qualified to serve as an external director if (i) the person is a relative of a controlling\nshareholder of the company, or (ii) if that person or his or her relative, partner, employer, another person to whom he or she was directly or indirectly\nsubordinate, or any entity under the persons control, has or had, during the two years preceding the date of appointment as an external director: (a) any\naffiliation or other disqualifying relationship with the company, with any person or entity controlling the company or a relative of such person, or with\nany entity controlled by or under common control with the company; or (b) in the case of a company with no shareholder holding 25% or more of its\nvoting rights, had at the date of appointment as an external director, any affiliation or other disqualifying relationship with a person then serving as\nchairman of the board or chief executive officer, with a holder of 5% or more of the issued share capital or voting power in the company or with the most\nsenior financial officer.\nThe term relative is defined under the Companies Law as a spouse, sibling, parent, grandparent or descendant; spouses sibling, parent or\ndescendant; and the spouse of each of the foregoing persons.\nUnder the Companies Law, the term affiliation and the similar types of disqualifying relationships include (subject to certain exceptions):\nan employment relationship;\na business or professional relationship even if not maintained on a regular basis (excluding insignificant relationships);\ncontrol; and\nservice as an office holder, excluding service as a director in a private company prior to the initial public offering of its shares if such\ndirector was appointed as a director of the private company in order to serve as an external director following the initial public offering.\nThe term office holder is defined under the Companies Law as a general manager, chief business manager, deputy general manager, vice\ngeneral manager, any other person assuming the responsibilities of any of these positions regardless of that persons title, a director and any other\nmanager directly subordinate to the general manager.\nIn addition, no person may serve as an external director if that persons position or professional or other activities create, or may create, a\nconflict of interest with that persons responsibilities as a director or otherwise interfere with that persons ability to serve as a director or if the person is\nan employee of the Israel Securities Authority or of an Israeli stock exchange. A person may furthermore not continue to serve as an external director if\nhe or she received direct or indirect compensation from the company including amounts paid pursuant to indemnification and/or exculpation contracts or\ncommitments and insurance coverage, other than for his or her service as an external director as permitted by the Companies Law and the regulations\npromulgated thereunder.\nFollowing the termination of an external directors service on a board of directors, such former external director and his or her spouse and\nchildren may not be provided a direct or indirect benefit by the company, its controlling shareholder or any entity under its controlling shareholders\ncontrol. This includes engagement as an office holder or director of the company or a company controlled by its controlling shareholder or employment\nby, or provision of services to, any such company for consideration, either directly or indirectly, including through a corporation controlled by the former\nexternal director. This restriction extends for a period of two years with regard to the former external director and his or her spouse or child and for one\nyear with respect to other relatives of the former external director.\nExternal directors may be removed only by a special general meeting of shareholders called by the board of directors after the board has\ndetermined the occurrence of circumstances allow such dismissal, at the same special majority of shareholders required for their election or by a court,\nand in both cases only if the external directors cease to meet the statutory qualifications for their appointment or if they violate their duty of loyalty to our\ncompany. In the event of a vacancy created by an external director which causes the company to have fewer than two external directors, the board of\ndirectors is required under the Companies Law to call a shareholders meeting as soon as possible to appoint such number of new external directors in\norder that the company thereafter has two external directors.\nExternal directors may be compensated only in accordance with regulations adopted under the Companies Law.\nIf at the time at which an external director is appointed all members of the board of directors who are not controlling shareholders or relatives of\ncontrolling shareholders of the company are of the same gender, the external director to be appointed must be of the other gender. A director of a\ncompany may not be appointed as an external director of another company if at the same time a director of such other company is acting as an external\ndirector of the first company.\n57\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 63\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nUnder regulations promulgated pursuant to the Companies Law, a company with no controlling shareholder whose shares are listed for trading\non specified exchanges outside of Israel, including the Nasdaq Capital Market, may adopt exemptions from various corporate governance requirements of\nthe Companies Law, so long as such company satisfies the requirements of applicable foreign country laws and regulations, including applicable stock\nexchange rules, that apply to companies organized in that country and relating to the appointment of independent directors and the composition of audit\nand compensation committees. Such exemptions include an exemption from the requirement to appoint external directors and the requirement that an\nexternal director be a member of certain committees, as well as exemption from limitations on directors compensation. We chose to use such\nexemptions.\nIndependent Directors Under the Companies Law\nAn independent director is either an external director or a director who meets the same non-affiliation criteria as an external director (except\nfor (i) the requirement that the director be an Israeli resident (which does not apply to companies such as ours whose securities have been offered outside\nof Israel or are listed outside of Israel) and (ii) the requirement for accounting and financial expertise or professional qualifications), as determined by the\naudit committee, and who has not served as a director of the company for more than nine consecutive years. For these purposes, ceasing to serve as a\ndirector for a period of two years or less would not be deemed to sever the consecutive nature of such directors service.\nRegulations promulgated pursuant to the Companies Law provide that a director in a public company whose shares are listed for trading on\nspecified exchanges outside of Israel, including Nasdaq, who qualifies as an independent director under the relevant non-Israeli rules and who meets\ncertain non-affiliation criteria, which are less stringent than those applicable to independent directors as set forth above, would be deemed an\nindependent director pursuant to the Companies Law provided: (i) he or she has not served as a director for more than nine consecutive years; (ii) he or\nshe has been approved as such by the audit committee; and (iii) his or her remuneration shall be in accordance with the Companies Law and the\nregulations promulgated thereunder. For these purposes, ceasing to serve as a director for a period of two years or less would not be deemed to sever the\nconsecutive nature of such directors service.\nFurthermore, pursuant to these regulations, such company may reappoint a person as an independent director for additional terms, beyond nine\nyears, which do not exceed three years each, if each of the audit committee and the board of directors determine, in that order, that in light of the\nindependent directors expertise and special contribution to the board of directors and its committees, the reappointment for an additional term is in the\ncompanys best interest.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nOur board of directors has established two standing committees, the audit and financial statement examination committee and the compensation\ncommittee.\nAudit Committee\nUnder the Companies Law, we are required to appoint an audit committee, to which the following will not be able to be appointed: the chairman\nof the board; any director employed by the company or employed by a controlling shareholder or by a corporation controlled by such controlling\nshareholder; a director who provides services, regularly, to the company, to a controlling shareholder of the Company or to an entity controlled by a\ncontrolling shareholder of the Company; a director who derives most of his or her income from a controlling shareholder of the Company; and a\ncontrolling shareholder of the company or a relative of a controlling shareholder.\nUnder regulations promulgated pursuant to the Companies Law, a company with no controlling shareholder whose shares are listed for trading\noutside of Israel, including the Nasdaq Capital Market, may adopt exemptions from various corporate governance requirements of the Companies Law,\nso long as such company satisfies the requirements of applicable foreign country laws and regulations, including applicable stock exchange rules, that\napply to companies organized in that country and relating to the appointment of independent directors and the composition of audit and compensation\ncommittees.

To that end, a portion of an executive officer compensation package is targeted to reflect our short and long-term goals, as well as the\nexecutive officers individual performance. On the other hand, our compensation policy will include measures designed to reduce the executive officers\nincentives to take excessive risks that may harm us in the long-term, such as limits on the value of cash bonuses and equity-based compensation,\nlimitations on the ratio between the variable and the total compensation of an executive officer and minimum vesting periods for equity-based\ncompensation.\nOur compensation policy also address our executive officers individual characteristics (such as his or her respective position, education, scope\nof responsibilities and contribution to the attainment of our goals) as the basis for compensation variation among our executive officers and considers the\ninternal ratios between compensation of our executive officers and directors and other employees.

Our compensation policy provides for executive officer compensation in the form of share\noptions or other equity-based awards, such as restricted shares and phantom, options, in accordance with our share incentive plan then in place.

Where the director is also a controlling shareholder, the requirements for approval of transactions\nwith controlling shareholders apply.\nFiduciary Duties of Office Holders\nThe Companies Law imposes a duty of care and a duty of loyalty on all office holders of a company.\nThe duty of care requires an office holder to act with the level of care with which a reasonable office holder in the same position would have\nacted under the same circumstances. The duty of care of an office holder includes a duty to use reasonable means to obtain:\ninformation on the advisability of a given action brought for his approval or performed by him by virtue of his position; and\nall other important information pertaining to these actions.\nThe duty of loyalty of an office holder requires an office holder to act in good faith and for the benefit of the company, and includes a duty to:\nrefrain from any conflict of interest between the performance of his duties in the company and his performance of his other duties or\npersonal affairs;\nrefrain from any action that is competitive with the companys business;\nrefrain from exploiting any business opportunity of the company to receive a personal gain for himself or others; and\ndisclose to the company any information or documents relating to the companys affairs which the office holder has received due to his\nposition as an office holder.\n63\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 69\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nInsurance\nUnder the Companies Law, a company may obtain insurance for any of its office holders against the following liabilities incurred due to acts he\nor she performed as an office holder, if and to the extent provided for in the companys articles of association:\nbreach of his or her duty of care to the company or to another person, to the extent such a breach arises out of the negligent conduct of the\noffice holder;\na breach of his or her duty of loyalty to the company, provided that the office holder acted in good faith and had reasonable cause to assume\nthat his or her act would not prejudice the companys interests; and\na financial liability imposed upon him or her in favor of another person.\nWe currently have directors and officers liability insurance, providing total coverage of $5.0 million for the benefit of all of our directors and\nofficers, in respect of which we paid a twelve-month premium of approximately $500,000, which expires on December 13, 2022.\nIndemnification\nThe Companies Law and the Israeli Securities Law, 1968, or the Securities Law, provide that a company may indemnify an office holder against\nthe following liabilities and expenses incurred for acts performed by him or her as an office holder, either pursuant to an undertaking made in advance of\nan event or following an event, provided its articles of association include a provision authorizing such indemnification:\na financial liability imposed on him or her in favor of another person by any judgment concerning an act performed in his or her capacity as\nan office holder, including a settlement or arbitrators award approved by a court;\nreasonable litigation expenses, including attorneys fees, expended by the office holder (a) as a result of an investigation or proceeding\ninstituted against him or her by an authority authorized to conduct such investigation or proceeding, provided that (1) no indictment (as\ndefined in the Companies Law) was filed against such office holder as a result of such investigation or proceeding; and (2) no financial\nliability as a substitute for the criminal proceeding (as defined in the Companies Law) was imposed upon him or her as a result of such\ninvestigation or proceeding, or, if such financial liability was imposed, it was imposed with respect to an offense that does not require proof\nof criminal intent; or (b) in connection with a monetary sanction; and\nreasonable litigation expenses, including attorneys fees, expended by the office holder or imposed on him or her by a court: (1) in\nproceedings that the company institutes, or that another person institutes on the companys behalf, against him or her; (2) in a criminal\nproceeding of which he or she was acquitted; or (3) as a result of a conviction for a crime that does not require proof of criminal intent.\nThe Companies Law also permits a company to undertake in advance to indemnify an office holder, provided that if such indemnification relates\nto financial liability imposed on him or her, as described above, then the undertaking should be limited and shall detail the following foreseen events and\namount or criterion:\nto events that in the opinion of the board of directors can be foreseen based on the companys activities at the time that the undertaking to\nindemnify is made; and\nin amount or criterion determined by the board of directors, at the time of the giving of such undertaking to indemnify, to be reasonable\nunder the circumstances.\nWe have entered into our standard form of indemnification agreement, the form of which will be filed as an exhibit to the registration statement\nof which this annual report forms a part, with each of our directors and members of our senior management.

Our articles of association provide that we may exculpate, in whole or in part, any office holder from liability to us for damages caused to the\ncompany as a result of a breach of his or her duty of care, but prohibit an exculpation from liability arising from a companys transaction in which our\ncontrolling shareholder or officer has a personal interest. Subject to the aforesaid limitations, and to other limitations detailed in the indemnification\nagreement, we exculpate and release our office holders from any and all liability to us related to any breach by them of their duty of care to us to the\nfullest extent permitted by law.\nLimitations\nThe Companies Law provides that we may not exculpate or indemnify an office holder nor enter into an insurance contract that would provide\ncoverage for any liability incurred as a result of any of the following: (1) a breach by the office holder of his or her duty of loyalty unless (in the case of\nindemnity or insurance only, but not exculpation) the office holder acted in good faith and had a reasonable basis to believe that the act would not\nprejudice us; (2) a breach by the office holder of his or her duty of care if the breach was carried out intentionally or recklessly (as opposed to merely\nnegligently); (3) any act or omission committed with the intent to derive an illegal personal benefit; or (4) any fine, monetary sanction, penalty or forfeit\nlevied against the office holder.\nUnder the Companies Law, exculpation, indemnification and insurance of office holders in a public company must be approved by the\ncompensation committee and the board of directors and, with respect to certain office holders or under certain circumstances, also by the shareholders.\nOur articles of association permit us to exculpate (subject to the aforesaid limitation), indemnify and ensure our office holders to the fullest\nextent permitted or to be permitted by the Companies Law.\nThe foregoing descriptions summarize the material aspects and practices of our board of directors.

If the transaction is an extraordinary transaction, the office holder must also\ndisclose any personal interest held by:\nthe office holders relatives; or\nany corporation in which the office holder or his or her relatives holds 5% or more of the shares or voting rights, serves as a director or\ngeneral manager or has the right to appoint at least one director or the general manager.\nAn office holder is not, however, obliged to disclose a personal interest if it derives solely from the personal interest of his or her relative in a\ntransaction that is not considered an extraordinary transaction. Under the Companies Law, an extraordinary transaction is a transaction:\nnot in the ordinary course of business;\nnot on market terms; or\nthat is likely to have a material effect on the companys profitability, assets or liabilities.\nThe Companies Law does not specify to whom within us nor the manner in which required disclosures are to be made. We require our office\nholders to make such disclosures to our board of directors.\nUnder the Companies Law, once an office holder complies with the above disclosure requirement, the board of directors may approve a\ntransaction between the company and an office holder, or a third party in which an office holder has a personal interest, unless the articles of association\nprovide otherwise and provided that the transaction is in the companys interest. If the transaction is an extraordinary transaction in which an office\nholder has a personal interest, first the audit committee and then the board of directors, in that order, must approve the transaction. Under specific\ncircumstances, shareholder approval may also be required. Generally, a person who has a personal interest in a matter which is considered at a meeting of\nthe board of directors or the audit committee may not be present at such a meeting unless the chairman of the audit committee or board of directors (as\napplicable) determines that he or she should be present in order to present the transaction that is subject to approval. A director who has a personal\ninterest in a transaction, which is considered at a meeting of the board of directors or the audit committee, may not be present at this meeting or vote on\nthis matter, unless a majority of members of the board of directors or the audit committee, as the case may be, has a personal interest. If a majority of the\nboard of directors has a personal interest, then shareholder approval is generally also required.\nDisclosure of Personal Interests of a Controlling Shareholder\nUnder the Companies Law, the disclosure requirements that apply to an office holder also apply to a controlling shareholder of a public\ncompany. Extraordinary transactions with a controlling shareholder or in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest, including a private\nplacement in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest, as well as transactions for the provision of services whether directly or indirectly by\na controlling shareholder or his or her relative, or a company such controlling shareholder controls, and transactions concerning the terms of engagement\nand compensation of a controlling shareholder or a controlling shareholders relative, whether as an office holder or an employee, require the approval of\nthe audit committee or the compensation committee, as the case may be, the board of directors and a majority of the shares voted by the shareholders of\nthe company participating and voting on the matter in a shareholders meeting. In addition, the shareholder approval must fulfill one of the following\nrequirements:\nat least a majority of the shares held by shareholders who have no personal interest in the transaction and are voting at the meeting must be\nvoted in favor of approving the transaction, excluding abstentions; or\nthe shares voted by shareholders who have no personal interest in the transaction who vote against the transaction represent no more than\n2% of the voting rights in the company.\n66\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 72\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nIn addition, any extraordinary transaction with a controlling shareholder or in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest with a term\nof more than three years requires the abovementioned approval every three years; however, such transactions not involving the receipt of services or\ncompensation can be approved for a longer term, provided that the audit committee determines that such longer term is reasonable under the\ncircumstances.\nThe Companies Law requires that every shareholder that participates, in person, by proxy or by voting instrument, in a vote regarding a\ntransaction with a controlling shareholder, must indicate in advance or in the ballot whether or not that shareholder has a personal interest in the vote in\nquestion. Failure to so indicate will result in the invalidation of that shareholders vote.\nThe term controlling shareholder is defined in the Companies Law as a shareholder with the ability to direct the activities of the company,\nother than by virtue of being an office holder. A shareholder is presumed to be a controlling shareholder if the shareholder holds 50% or more of the\nvoting rights in a company or has the right to appoint 50% or more of the directors of the company or its general manager. In the context of a transaction\ninvolving a shareholder of the company, a controlling shareholder also includes a shareholder who holds 25% or more of the voting rights in the company\nif no other shareholder holds more than 50% of the voting rights in the company. For this purpose, the holdings of all shareholders who have a personal\ninterest in the same transaction will be aggregated.\nApproval of the Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers\nThe compensation of, or an undertaking to indemnify, insure or exculpate, an office holder who is not a director requires the approval of the\ncompanys compensation committee, followed by the approval of the companys board of directors, and, if such compensation arrangement or an\nundertaking to indemnify, insure or exculpate is inconsistent with the companys stated compensation policy, or if the said office holder is the chief\nexecutive officer of the company (subject to a number of specific exceptions), then such arrangement is subject to the approval of our shareholders,\nsubject to a special majority requirement.\nDirectors. Under the Companies Law, the compensation of our directors requires the approval of our compensation committee, the subsequent\napproval of the board of directors and, unless exempted under the regulations promulgated under the Companies Law, the approval of the general meeting\nof our shareholders. If the compensation of our directors is inconsistent with our stated compensation policy, then, provided that those provisions that\nmust be included in the compensation policy according to the Companies Law have been considered by the compensation committee and board of\ndirectors, shareholder approval by a special majority will be required.\nExecutive officers other than the chief executive officer. The Companies Law requires the approval of the compensation of a public companys\nexecutive officers (other than the chief executive officer) in the following order: (i) the compensation committee, (ii) the companys board of directors,\nand (iii) only if such compensation arrangement is inconsistent with the companys stated compensation policy, the companys shareholders by a special\nmajority. However, if the shareholders of the company do not approve a compensation arrangement with an executive officer that is inconsistent with the\ncompanys stated compensation policy, the compensation committee and board of directors may override the shareholders decision if each of the\ncompensation committee and the board of directors provide detailed reasons for their decision.\nChief executive officer. Under the Companies Law, the compensation of a public companys chief executive officer is required to be approved\nby: (i) the companys compensation committee; (ii) the companys board of directors, and (iii) the companys shareholders by a special majority.\nHowever, if the shareholders of the company do not approve the compensation arrangement with the chief executive officer, the compensation committee\nand board of directors may override the shareholders decision if each of the compensation committee and the board of directors provides detailed reasons\nfor their decision.

However, the effective tax rate payable by a company that\nderives income from a Preferred Enterprise or Preferred Technological Enterprise (as discussed below) may be considerably less.\n76\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 82\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nCapital gains derived by an Israeli resident company are subject to tax at the regular corporate tax rate. Under Israeli tax legislation, a\ncorporation will be considered as an Israeli resident company if it meets one of the following criteria: (i) it was incorporated in Israel; or (ii) the control\nand management of its business are exercised in Israel.\nLaw for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969\nThe Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969, generally referred to as the Industry Encouragement Law, provides several tax\nbenefits for Industrial Companies.\nThe Industry Encouragement Law defines an Industrial Company as an Israeli resident-company, which has 90% or more of its income in any\ntax year, other than income from defense loans, derived from an Industrial Enterprise owned by it. An Industrial Enterprise is defined as an enterprise\nwhose principal activity in a given tax year is industrial production.\nThe following corporate tax benefits, among others, are available to Industrial Companies:\namortization of the cost to purchase a patent, rights to use a patent, and know-how, which are used for the development or advancement of\nthe company, over an eight-year period, commencing on the year in which such rights were first exercised;\nunder limited conditions, an election to file consolidated tax returns with related Israeli Industrial Companies; and\nexpenses related to a public offering are deductible in equal amounts over three years.\nEligibility for benefits under the Industry Encouragement Law is not contingent upon approval of any governmental authority, but it quite\ncommon to maintain preapproval from the Israeli Tax Authority, or the ITA.\nTax Benefits and Grants for Research and Development\nGeneral. The IIA, an independent publicly funded agency, was created to provide a variety of practical tools and funding platforms aimed at\neffectively addressing the dynamic and changing needs of the local and international innovation ecosystem. The IIA acts under the Law for the\nEncouragement of Research, Development and Technological Innovation in the Industry 1984 and the related IIA rules and regulations, or the Innovation\nLaw. Companies that receive funding from the IIA are subject to certain liabilities of the Innovation Law, mainly pertaining to the know-how that was\ndeveloped with the support of the IIA within the framework of an R&D funding program, and/or its derivatives, or the IIA-supported Know-how, and/or\nto the products derived from the technology that was developed with the support of the IIA within the framework of an R&D funding program, and/or its\nderivatives, or IIA-supported products.\nOwnership Structure. Any change of ownership must be reported to the IIA prior to the execution of the acquisition. A change in the\ncompanys ownership, in which a foreign entity becomes a shareholder in the company, requires the IIA approval and the new shareholder signature on\nan undertaking letter acknowledging the companys liabilities to the Innovation Law.\nRoyalty payment. Companies supported by the IIA are required to pay royalties on income yielded from the IIA-supported products, until full\nrefund of the grant, which is linked to the US dollar and carries interest (the annual LIBOR interest for annual dollar deposits, as published on the first\nday of trading of each year, or in an alternate publication according to the Bank of Israels announcement). Until July 2017, the rate of the royalties\nrefund was 3% of related income in the first three years, and 3.5% from the 4th year, onward. As of July 2017, the rate of the royalties refund for\ncompanies with total revenues of under $70 million at the year preceding the application date, has changed to 3%.\n77\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 83\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nManufacturing location. Until 2003, manufacturing was considered to be done completely in Israel, and after this date, the manufacturing\nlocation (including assembly) is determined based on the manufacturing declaration located in the grant application submitted for supporting R&D, or the\nManufacturing Declaration. The transfer of manufacturing activity outside Israel may be subject to the prior approval of the IIA and may result in an\nincreased royalty payment rate and an increased total royalty payment, which will be calculated based on the deviation from the companys\nManufacturing Declaration. Cumulative deviation of under 10% requires notification of the IIA, while 10% or more requires pre-approval.\nThe rate of royalty payment due to overseas manufacturing is increased as follows: If the foreign company will be given the rights to only\nmanufacture the IIA-supported products, an additional 1% will be incurred (e.g., instead of paying 3%, the company will pay 4%). However, if the\nforeign company will be given the rights to both manufacture and distribute the IIA-supported products, the royalties rate may be higher. The increased\nroyalty rate will apply for revenues associated with manufacturing outside of Israel only. In general, royalties will be paid from the final sale price to the\nclient and not from the inter-company transfer price. The company will have to keep paying royalties until it reaches the new royalty liability ceiling.\nThe increased repayment is calculated according to the percentage of the manufacturing activities that are carried out outside of Israel out of the\ntotal cumulative manufacturing activities both in Israel and abroad, as described in the following table:\nPercentage of manufacturing activities performed\noutside of Israel, cumulatively The increased payment to the IIA\nUp to 50% 120% of the received grants + interest\nBetween 50% and 90% 150% of the received grants + interest\n90% and more 300% of the received grants + interest\nKnow-how location. To the extent a company wishes to transfer its IIA-supported Know-how outside of Israel, the transfer must be\npreapproved by the IIA and the company may be required to pay an additional payment to the IIA, or the Fee, as described below. This Fee (which also\nrelates to programs that are absolved of royalty payment) is calculated according to the ratio between the total grants received from the IIA and the total\nfinancial R&D expenses invested in the related know-how (including the received grants), multiplied by the transaction price of the IIA-supported Know-\nhow, or the Basic Amount.\nThe Basic Amount minus the received grants is depreciated at a rate of 1/7 per annum, as of the fourth year from the end of the last supported\nfile in each program. As a result, when transferring IIA-supported Know-how after 10 years or more, the maximum payment to the IIA will be only the\ntotal sum of the received grants plus interest, minus paid royalties.\nHowever, the aforementioned formula has a minimum and a maximum limits. The minimum amount of the payment is the total sum of grants\nreceived plus interest. The maximum amount shall be no higher than 6 times the total sum of grants received plus interest. In the case that the IIA-\nsupported company retains its R&D center in Israel for at least 3 consecutive years, following the year of transferring the IIA-supported Know-how\noutside of Israel, while maintaining at least 75% of its R&D employment in Israel  the payment will be limited to 3 times the total sum of grants\nreceived plus interest.\nTransferring IIA-supported Know-how outside of Israel according to the Innovation Law (including paying the Fee where necessary) releases\nthe IIA-supported company from all liabilities to the IIA.\nTransfer of know-how to another Israeli entity is subject to signature of the recipient Israeli entity on a formal IIA issued undertaking document,\nto comply with the provisions of the Innovation Law, including the restrictions on the transfer of know-how and the obligation to pay royalties.\n78\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 84\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nAccording to the above, these liabilities should be taken into account when we consider to outsource manufacturing, engage in change of control\ntransactions or otherwise transfer our know-how outside of Israel, and may require us to obtain the pre-approval of the IIA for certain actions and\ntransactions and pay additional payments to the IIA. In particular, any change of control and any change of ownership of our Ordinary Shares that would\nmake a non-Israeli citizen or resident an interested party, as defined in the Innovation Law, requires a prior written notice to the IIA in addition to any\npayment that may be required of us for transfer of manufacturing or know-how outside of Israel. If we fail to comply with the Innovation Law, we may\nbe subject to criminal charges.\nTax Benefits for Research and Development\nIsraeli tax law allows, under certain conditions, a tax deduction for expenditures, including capital expenditures, for the year in which they are\nincurred. Expenditures are deemed related to scientific research and development projects, if:\nThe expenditures are approved by the relevant Israeli government ministry, determined by the field of research;\nThe research and development must be for the promotion of the company; and\nThe research and development is carried out by or on behalf of the company seeking such tax deduction.\nThe amount of such deductible expenses is reduced by the sum of any funds received through government grants for the finance of such\nscientific research and development projects. No deduction under these research and development deduction rules is allowed if such deduction is related\nto an expense invested in an asset depreciable under the general depreciation rules of the Tax Ordinance. Expenditures not so approved are deductible in\nequal amounts over three years.\nFrom time to time, we may apply the Office of the Chief Scientist for approval to allow a tax deduction for all research and development\nexpenses during the year incurred. There can be no assurance that such application will be accepted.\nLaw for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959\nThe Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959, generally referred to as the Investment Law, provides certain incentives for\ncapital investments in production facilities (or other eligible assets).\nTax benefits under the 2011 Amendment\nThe 2011 Amendment canceled the availability of the benefits granted under the Investment Law prior to 2011 and, instead introduced new\nbenefits for income generated by a Preferred Company through its Preferred Enterprise (as such terms are defined in the Investment Law) as of\nJanuary 1, 2011. The definition of a Preferred Company includes a company incorporated in Israel that is not fully owned by a governmental entity, and\nthat has, among other things, Preferred Enterprise status and is controlled and managed from Israel. Pursuant to the 2011 Amendment, a Preferred\nCompany is entitled to a reduced corporate tax rate of 16% with respect to its income derived from its Preferred Enterprise, unless the Preferred\nEnterprise is located in a specified development zone, in which case the rate will be 7.5%. Income derived by a Preferred Company from a Special\nPreferred Enterprise (as such term is defined in the Investment Law) would be entitled, during a benefits period of 10 years, to further reduced tax rates\nof 8%, or 5% if the Special Preferred Enterprise is located in a certain development zone.\n79\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 85\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nDividends distributed from income which is attributed to a Preferred Enterprise should generally be subject to withholding tax at source at the\nfollowing rates: (i) Israeli resident corporations - 0%, (although, if such dividends are subsequently distributed to individuals or a non-Israeli company the\nbelow rates detailed in sub sections (ii) and (iii) shall apply), (ii) Israeli resident individuals - 20% and (iii) non-Israeli residents (individuals and\ncorporations) - subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the ITA allowing for a reduced tax rate, 20% or such lower rate as may be\nprovided under the provisions of any applicable double tax treaty.\nWe currently do not intend to implement the 2011 Amendment.\nTax benefits under the 2017 Amendment that became effective on January 1, 2017\nThe 2017 Amendment was enacted as part of the Economic Efficiency Law that was published on December 29, 2016, and is effective as of\nJanuary 1, 2017. The 2017 Amendment provided new tax benefits for two types of Technological Enterprises, as described below, and is in addition to\nthe other existing tax beneficial programs under the Investment Law.\nThe 2017 Amendment provides that a technology company satisfying certain conditions should qualify as a Preferred Technological Enterprise,\nor PTE, and thereby enjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 12% on income that qualifies as Preferred Technological Income, as defined in the\nInvestment Law. The tax rate is further reduced to 7.5% for a PTE located in development zone A. In addition, a PTE will enjoy a reduced corporate\ntax rate of 12% on capital gain derived from the sale of certain Benefited Intangible Assets (as defined in the Investment Law) to a related foreign\ncompany if the Benefited Intangible Assets were acquired from a foreign company on or after January 1, 2017 for at least NIS 200 million, and the sale\nreceived prior approval from the National Authority for Technological Innovation previously known as the Israeli Office of the Chief Scientist), to which\nwe refer as IIA.\nThe 2017 Amendment further provides that a technology company satisfying certain conditions (group turnover of at least NIS 10 billion)\nshould qualify as a Special Preferred Technological Enterprise and will thereby enjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 6% on Preferred Technological\nIncome regardless of the companys geographic location within Israel. In addition, a Special Preferred Technological Enterprise should enjoy a reduced\ncorporate tax rate of 6% on capital gain derived from the sale of certain Benefited Intangible Assets to a related foreign company if the Benefited\nIntangible Assets were either developed by the Special Preferred Enterprise or acquired from a foreign company on or after January 1, 2017, and the sale\nreceived prior approval from IIA. A Special Preferred Technological Enterprise that acquires Benefited Intangible Assets from a foreign company for\nmore than NIS 500 million should be eligible for these benefits for at least ten years, subject to certain approvals as specified in the Investment Law.\nDividends distributed out of Preferred Technological Income to Israeli shareholders by a PTE or a Special Preferred Technology Enterprise, paid\nout of Preferred Technological Income, should generally subject to withholding tax at source at the rate of 20% (in the case of non-Israeli shareholders, a\nlower rate may be provided in an applicable tax treaty) but in either case, subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the ITA allowing for\na reduced tax rate. However, if such dividends are paid to an Israeli company, no tax is generally required to be withheld (although, if such dividends are\nsubsequently distributed to individuals or a non-Israeli company, withholding tax at a rate of 20% or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable\ntax treaty, should apply). If such dividends are distributed to a foreign company that holds solely or together with other foreign companies 90% or more\nin the Israeli company and other conditions are met, the withholding tax rate should be 4% (or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable tax\ntreaty, in either case, subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the ITA allowing for such reduced tax rate).\nWe are examining the potential impact of the 2017 Amendment and the degree to which we may qualify as a PTE, the amount of Preferred\nTechnological Income that we may have and other benefits that we may receive from the 2017 Amendment in the future.\n80\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 86\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nTaxation of our Shareholders\nCapital Gains Taxes Applicable to Non-Israeli Resident Shareholders. A non-Israeli resident who derives capital gains from the sale of shares in\nan Israeli resident company will be exempt from Israeli tax so long as the shares were not held through a permanent establishment that the non-resident\nmaintains in Israel. However, non-Israeli corporations will not be entitled to the foregoing exemption if Israeli residents: (i) have a controlling interest of\n25% or more in such non-Israeli corporation or (ii) are the beneficiaries of, or are entitled to, 25% or more of the revenues or profits of such non-Israeli\ncorporation, whether directly or indirectly.\nAdditionally, a sale of securities by a non-Israeli resident may be exempt from Israeli capital gains tax under the provisions of an applicable tax\ntreaty. For example, under Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the State of Israel with respect\nto Taxes on Income, as amended, or the United States-Israel Tax Treaty, the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares by a shareholder who is a\nUnited States resident (for purposes of the treaty) holding the shares as a capital asset and is entitled to claim the benefits afforded to such a resident by\nthe U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty, or a Treaty U.S. Resident, is generally exempt from Israeli capital gains tax unless: (i) the capital gain arising from such sale,\nexchange or disposition is attributed to real estate located in Israel; (ii) the capital gain arising from such sale, exchange or disposition is attributed to\nroyalties; (iii) the capital gain arising from the such sale, exchange or disposition is attributed to a permanent establishment in Israel, under certain terms;\n(iv) such Treaty U.S. Resident holds, directly or indirectly, shares representing 10% or more of the voting capital during any part of the 12-month period\npreceding the disposition, subject to certain conditions; or (v) such Treaty U.S. Resident is an individual and was present in Israel for 183 days or more\nduring the relevant taxable year.\nIn some instances where our shareholders may be liable for Israeli tax on the sale of their Ordinary Shares, the payment of the consideration may\nbe subject to the withholding of Israeli tax at source. Shareholders may be required to demonstrate that they are exempt from tax on their capital gains in\norder to avoid withholding at source at the time of sale.\nTaxation of Non-Israeli Shareholders on Receipt of Dividends. Non-Israeli residents are generally subject to Israeli income tax on the receipt of\ndividends paid on our Ordinary Shares at the rate of 25%, which tax will be withheld at source, unless relief is provided in a treaty between Israel and the\nshareholders country of residence. With respect to a person who is a substantial shareholder at the time of receiving the dividend or at any time during\nthe preceding twelve months, the applicable tax rate is 30%. A substantial shareholder is generally a person who alone or together with such persons\nrelative or another person who collaborates with such person on a permanent basis, holds, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of any of the means of\ncontrol of the corporation at the time of receiving the dividend or at any time during the preceding twelve months. Means of control generally include\nthe right to vote, receive profits, nominate a director or an executive officer, receive assets upon liquidation, or order someone who holds any of the\naforesaid rights how to act, regardless of the source of such right. However, a distribution of dividends to non-Israeli residents is subject to withholding\ntax at source at a rate of 20% if the dividend is distributed from income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise or PTE, unless a reduced tax rate is provided\nunder an applicable tax treaty. For example, under the United States-Israel Tax Treaty, the maximum rate of tax withheld at source in Israel on dividends\npaid to a holder of our Ordinary Shares who is a Treaty U.S. Resident is 25%. However, generally, the maximum rate of withholding tax on dividends,\nnot generated by a Preferred Enterprise or PTE, that are paid to a United States corporation holding 10% or more of the outstanding voting capital\nthroughout the tax year in which the dividend is distributed as well as during the previous tax year, is 12.5%, provided that not more than 25% of the\ngross income for such preceding year consists of certain types of dividends and interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends distributed from\nincome attributed to a Preferred Enterprise or PTE are not entitled to such reduction under the tax treaty but are subject to a withholding tax rate of 15%\nfor a shareholder that is a U.S. corporation, provided that the condition related to our gross income for the previous year (as set forth in the previous\nsentence) is met. If the dividend is attributable partly to income derived from a Preferred Enterprise or PTE, and partly to other sources of income, the\nwithholding rate will be a blended rate reflecting the relative portions of the two types of income. We cannot assure you that we will designate the profits\nthat we may distribute in a way that will reduce shareholders tax liability.\n81\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 87\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\nTHE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS INCLUDED HEREIN FOR GENERAL INFORMATION AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE, AND\nSHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE, LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE. EACH U.S. HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT WITH HIS OR HER OWN TAX\nADVISOR AS TO THE PARTICULAR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP, AND SALE OF\nORDINARY SHARES, THE WARRANTS, THE PRE-FUNDED WARRANTS AND THE ORDINARY SHARES ISSUED OR ISSUABLE UPON\nEXERCISE OF THE WARRANTS AND PRE-FUNDED WARRANTS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF APPLICABLE STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN\nOR OTHER TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE TAX LAWS.\nSubject to the limitations described in the next paragraph, the following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences to a U.S. Holder arising from the purchase, ownership and sale of the Ordinary Shares, the Warrants, the Pre-funded Warrants and the\nOrdinary Shares issued or issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and Pre-funded Warrants, or collectively, the securities. For this purpose, a U.S.\nHolder is a holder of securities that is: (1) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, including an alien individual who is a lawful permanent\nresident of the United States or meets the substantial presence residency test under U.S. federal income tax laws; (2) a corporation (or entity treated as a\ncorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) or a partnership (other than a partnership that is not treated as a U.S. person under any applicable U.S.\nTreasury regulations) created or organized under the laws of the United States or the District of Columbia or any political subdivision thereof; (3) an\nestate, the income of which is includable in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of source; (4) a trust if a court within the United\nStates is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have authority to control all substantial\ndecisions of the trust; or (5) a trust that has a valid election in effect to be treated as a U.S. person to the extent provided in U.S. Treasury regulations.\nThis summary is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the U.S. federal income\ntax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase our securities. This summary generally considers only U.S. Holders that will own our\nsecurities as capital assets. Except to the limited extent discussed below, this summary does not consider the U.S. federal tax consequences to a person\nthat is not a U.S. Holder, nor does it describe the rules applicable to determine a taxpayers status as a U.S. Holder. This summary is based on the\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, final, temporary and proposed U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated\nthereunder, administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, (including with respect to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017), and the U.S.-Israel Income\nTax Treaty, all as in effect as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, and all of which are open to\ndiffering interpretations. We will not seek a ruling from the IRS with regard to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in our securities by\nU.S. Holders and, therefore, can provide no assurances that the IRS will agree with the conclusions set forth below.\nThis discussion does not address all of the aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular U.S. holder based on such\nholders particular circumstances and in particular does not discuss any estate, gift, generation-skipping, transfer, state, local, excise or foreign tax\nconsiderations. In addition, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a U.S. Holder who is: (1) a bank, life insurance\ncompany, regulated investment company, or other financial institution or financial services entity; (2) a broker or dealer in securities or foreign\ncurrency; (3) a person who acquired our securities in connection with employment or other performance of services; (4) a U.S. Holder that is subject to\nthe U.S. alternative minimum tax; (5) a U.S. Holder that holds our securities as a hedge or as part of a hedging, straddle, conversion or constructive sale\ntransaction or other risk-reduction transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (6) a tax-exempt entity; (7) real estate investment trusts or grantor\ntrusts; (8) a U.S. Holder that expatriates out of the United States or a former long-term resident of the United States; or (9) a person having a functional\ncurrency other than the U.S. dollar. This discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a U.S. Holder that owns, directly or\nconstructively, at any time, securities representing 10% or more of our voting power. Additionally, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of partnerships\n(or other pass-through entities) or persons who hold securities through a partnership or other pass-through entity are not addressed.\nEach prospective investor is advised to consult his or her own tax adviser for the specific tax consequences to that investor of purchasing,\nholding or disposing of our securities, including the effects of applicable state, local, foreign or other tax laws and possible changes in the tax laws.\n82\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 88\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nTax Treatment of the Pre-Funded Warrants\nWe intend to treat our Pre-funded Warrants as a class of our Ordinary Shares for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, our position is not\nbinding on the IRS and the IRS may treat the Pre-funded Warrants as warrants to acquire our common shares. Accordingly, you should consult your tax\nadviser regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the pre-funded warrants. The following discussion assumes our Pre-funded\nWarrants are properly treated as a class of our Ordinary Shares.\nExercise or Expiry of Pre-Funded Warrants and Warrants\nNo gain or loss will be realized on the exercise of a Pre-funded Warrant or Warrant. When a Pre-funded Warrant or Warrant is exercised, the\nU.S. Holders cost of the Ordinary Shares acquired thereby will be equal to the U.S. Holders adjusted cost basis of the Pre-funded Warrant and Warrant\nplus the exercise price paid for the Ordinary Shares. The expiration of an unexercised Warrant will generally give rise to a capital loss equal to the\nadjusted cost basis to the U.S. Holder of the Warrant. The Pre-Funded Warrants do not expire. The holding period of the Ordinary Shares acquired by the\nexercise of a Pre-Funded Warrant and Warrant includes the holding period of the Pre-funded Warrant and Warrant.\nTaxation of Dividends Paid on Securities\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future and U.S. Holders of Warrants and Pre-Funded Warrants are not entitled to dividends.\nIn the event that we do pay dividends, and subject to the discussion under the heading Passive Foreign Investment Companies below and the discussion\nof qualified dividend income below, a U.S. Holder, other than certain U.S. Holders that are U.S. corporations, will be required to include in gross\nincome as ordinary income the amount of any distribution paid on securities (including distributions paid on the Warrants and Pre-Funded Warrants if\nsuch warrants were to become entitled to dividends and the amount of any Israeli tax withheld on the date of the distribution), to the extent that such\ndistribution does not exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of a\ndistribution which exceeds our earnings and profits will be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital, reducing the U.S. Holders tax basis for the\nsecurities to the extent thereof, and then capital gain. We do not expect to maintain calculations of our earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax\nprinciples and, therefore, U.S. Holders should expect that the entire amount of any distribution generally will be reported as dividend income.\nIn general, preferential tax rates for qualified dividend income and long-term capital gains are applicable for U.S. Holders that are individuals,\nestates, or trusts. For this purpose, qualified dividend income means, inter alia, dividends received from a qualified foreign corporation. A qualified\nforeign corporation is a corporation that is entitled to the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the United States which includes an exchange of\ninformation program. The IRS has stated that the U.S.-Israel Tax Treaty satisfies this requirement and we believe we are eligible for the benefits of that\ntreaty.\nIn addition, our dividends will be qualified dividend income if our securities are readily tradable on the Nasdaq Capital Market or another\nestablished securities market in the United States. Dividends will not qualify for the preferential rate if we are treated, in the year the dividend is paid or\nin the prior year, as a PFIC, as described below under Passive Foreign Investment Companies. A U.S. Holder will not be entitled to the preferential\nrate: (1) if the U.S. Holder has not held our securities for at least 61 days of the 121 day period beginning on the date which is 60 days before the ex-\ndividend date, or (2) to the extent the U.S. Holder is under an obligation to make related payments on substantially similar property. Any days during\nwhich the U.S. Holder has diminished its risk of loss on our securities are not counted towards meeting the 61-day holding period. Finally, U.S. Holders\nwho elect to treat the dividend income as investment income pursuant to Code section 163(d)(4) will not be eligible for the preferential rate of taxation.\n83\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 89\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nThe amount of a distribution with respect to our securities will be measured by the amount of the fair market value of any property distributed,\nand for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of any Israeli taxes withheld therefrom. Cash distributions paid by us in NIS will be included in the\nincome of U.S. Holders at a U.S. dollar amount based upon the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date the dividend is includible in the income of the\nU.S. Holder, and U.S. Holders will have a tax basis in such NIS for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to such U.S. dollar value. If the U.S. Holder\nsubsequently converts the NIS into U.S. dollars or otherwise disposes of it, any subsequent gain or loss in respect of such NIS arising from exchange rate\nfluctuations will be U.S. source ordinary exchange gain or loss.\nTaxation of the Disposition of Securities\nExcept as provided under the PFIC rules described below under Passive Foreign Investment Companies, upon the sale, exchange or other\ndisposition of our securities, a U.S. Holder will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between such U.S. Holders tax basis\nfor the securities in U.S. dollars and the amount realized on the disposition in U.S. dollar (or its U.S. dollar equivalent determined by reference to the spot\nrate of exchange on the date of disposition, if the amount realized is denominated in a foreign currency). The gain or loss realized on the sale, exchange or\nother disposition of securities will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has a holding period of more than one year at the time of the\ndisposition. Individuals who recognize long-term capital gains may be taxed on such gains at reduced rates of tax. The deduction of capital losses is\nsubject to various limitations.\nPassive Foreign Investment Companies\nSpecial U.S. federal income tax laws apply to U.S. taxpayers who own shares of a corporation that is a PFIC. We will be treated as a PFIC for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year that either:\n75% or more of our gross income (including our pro-rata share of gross income for any company, in which we are considered to own 25%\nor more of the shares by value), in a taxable year is passive; or\nAt least 50% of our assets, averaged over the year and generally determined based upon fair market value (including our pro-rata share of\nthe assets of any company in which we are considered to own 25% or more of the shares by value) are held for the production of, or\nproduce, passive income.\nFor this purpose, passive income generally consists of dividends, interest, rents, royalties, annuities and income from certain commodities\ntransactions and from notional principal contracts. Cash is treated as generating passive income.\nThe tests for determining PFIC status are applied annually, and it is difficult to make accurate projections of future income and assets which are\nrelevant to this determination. In addition, our PFIC status may depend in part on the market value of our securities. Accordingly, there can be no\nassurance that we currently are not or will not become an PFIC.\nIf we currently are or become a PFIC, each U.S. Holder who has not elected to mark the shares to market (as discussed below), would, upon\nreceipt of certain distributions by us and upon disposition of our securities at a gain: (1) have such distribution or gain allocated ratably over the U.S.\nHolders holding period for the securities, as the case may be; (2) the amount allocated to the current taxable year and any period prior to the first day of\nthe first taxable year in which we were a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income; and (3) the amount allocated to each of the other taxable years would\nbe subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year, and an interest charge for the deemed deferral benefit\nwould be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such other taxable year. In addition, when shares of a PFIC are acquired by reason\nof death from a decedent that was a U.S. Holder, the tax basis of such shares would not receive a step-up to fair market value as of the date of the\ndecedents death, but instead would be equal to the decedents basis if lower, unless all gain were recognized by the decedent. Indirect investments in a\nPFIC may also be subject to these special U.S. federal income tax rules.\n84\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 90\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nThe PFIC rules described above would not apply to a U.S. Holder who makes a QEF election for all taxable years that such U.S. Holder has held\nthe securities while we are a PFIC, provided that we comply with specified reporting requirements. Instead, each U.S. Holder who has made such a QEF\nelection is required for each taxable year that we are a PFIC to include in income such U.S. Holders pro rata share of our ordinary earnings as ordinary\nincome and such U.S. Holders pro rata share of our net capital gains as long-term capital gain, regardless of whether we make any distributions of such\nearnings or gain. In general, a QEF election is effective only if we make available certain required information. The QEF election is made on a\nshareholder-by-shareholder basis and generally may be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. We do not intend to notify U.S. Holders if we believe\nwe will be treated as a PFIC for any tax year. In addition, we do not intend to furnish U.S. Holders annually with information needed in order to complete\nIRS Form 8621 and to make and maintain a valid QEF election for any year in which we or any of our subsidiaries are a PFIC. Therefore, the QEF\nelection will not be available with respect to our securities.\nIn addition, the PFIC rules described above would not apply if we were a PFIC and a U.S. Holder made a mark-to-market election. A U.S.\nHolder of our securities which are regularly traded on a qualifying exchange, including the Nasdaq Capital Market, can elect to mark the securities to\nmarket annually, recognizing as ordinary income or loss each year an amount equal to the difference as of the close of the taxable year between the fair\nmarket value of the securities and the U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in the securities. Losses are allowed only to the extent of net mark-to-market gain\npreviously included income by the U.S. Holder under the election for prior taxable years.\nU.S. Holders who hold our securities during a period when we are a PFIC will be subject to the foregoing rules, even if we cease to be a PFIC.\nU.S. Holders are strongly urged to consult their tax advisors about the PFIC rules.\nTax on Net Investment Income\nU.S. Holders who are individuals, estates or trusts will generally be required to pay a 3.8% Medicare tax on their net investment income\n(including dividends on and gains from the sale or other disposition of our securities), or in the case of estates and trusts on their net investment income\nthat is not distributed. In each case, the 3.8% Medicare tax applies only to the extent the U.S. Holders total adjusted income exceeds applicable\nthresholds.\nTax Consequences for Non-U.S. Holders of Securities\nExcept as provided below, an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not a U.S. Holder referred to below as a non-U.S. Holder, generally\nwill not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on the payment of dividends on, and the proceeds from the disposition of, our securities.\nA non-U.S. Holder may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a dividend paid on our securities or gain from the disposition of our securities\nif: (1) such item is effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business in the United States and, if required by an\napplicable income tax treaty is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed place of business in the United States; or (2) in the case of a disposition\nof our securities, the individual non-U.S. Holder is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition and other\nspecified conditions are met.\nIn general, non-U.S. Holders will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to the payment of dividends on our securities if payment is\nmade through a paying agent, or office of a foreign broker outside the United States. However, if payment is made in the United States or by a\nU.S. related person, non-U.S. Holders may be subject to backup withholding, unless the non-U.S. Holder provides an applicable IRS Form W-8 (or a\nsubstantially similar form) certifying its foreign status, or otherwise establishes an exemption.\nThe amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a non-U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against such holders U.S. federal\nincome tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\nInformation Reporting and Withholding\nA U.S. Holder may be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 24% with respect to cash dividends and proceeds from a disposition of\nsecurities. In general, backup withholding will apply only if a U.S. Holder fails to comply with specified identification procedures. Backup withholding\nwill not apply with respect to payments made to designated exempt recipients, such as corporations and tax-exempt organizations. Backup withholding is\nnot an additional tax and may be claimed as a credit against the U.S. federal income tax liability of a U.S. Holder, provided that the required information\nis timely furnished to the IRS.\nPursuant to recently enacted legislation, a U.S. Holder with interests in specified foreign financial assets (including, among other assets, our\nsecurities, unless such securities are held on such U.S. Holders behalf through a financial institution) may be required to file an information report with\nthe IRS if the aggregate value of all such assets exceeds $50,000 on the last day of the taxable year or $75,000 at any time during the taxable year (or\nsuch higher dollar amount as may be prescribed by applicable IRS guidance); and may be required to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial\nAccounts, or FBAR, if the aggregate value of the foreign financial accounts exceeds $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. You should consult\nyour own tax advisor as to the possible obligation to file such information report.\nF. Dividends and Paying Agents\nNot applicable.\nG.

The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports and other information regarding issuers that file\nelectronically with the SEC. Our filings with the SEC will also available to the public through the SECs website at www.sec.gov.\nAs a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act related to the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and\nour officers, directors and principal shareholders will be exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of\nthe Exchange Act. In addition, we are not required under the Exchange Act to file annual, quarterly and current reports and financial statements with the\nSEC as frequently or as promptly as U.S. domestic companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act. However, we will file with the\nSEC, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, or such applicable time as required by the SEC, an annual report containing financial statements\naudited by an independent registered public accounting firm, and may submit to the SEC, on a Form 6-K, unaudited half-yearly financial information.\nWe maintain a corporate website www.maris-tech.com.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nIn the ordinary course of our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates and\ninterest rates.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial\nposition due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our current investment policy is to invest available cash in bank deposits with banks\nthat have a credit rating of at least A-minus. Accordingly, some of our cash and cash equivalents is held in deposits that bear interest. Given the current\nlow rates of interest we receive, we will not be adversely affected if such rates are reduced. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of U.S.\ndollar/NIS exchange rates, which is discussed in detail in the following paragraph.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Although the U.S. dollar is our functional currency, the vast majority of our expenses\nare denominated in NIS, and currently most of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately\n90% of our expenses were denominated in NIS. Our foreign currency exposures give rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the\nU.S. dollar against the NIS. Our NIS expenses consist principally of payroll to our employees in Israel, payments made to subcontractors for purchasing\ncomponents to our products, research and development activities and marketing and sales activities. We anticipate that a significant portion of our\nexpenses will continue to be denominated in NIS. If the U.S. dollar fluctuates significantly against the NIS, it may have a negative impact on our results\nof operations. To date, fluctuations in the exchange rates have not materially affected our results of operations or financial condition.\nDue to the fact that exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the NIS fluctuate continuously, such fluctuations have an impact on our results\nand period-to-period comparisons of our results. The effects of foreign currency remeasurements are reported in our statements of operations.. These\nmeasures, however, may not adequately protect us from the material adverse effects of such fluctuations.\nCurrently, we do not hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. In the future, we may enter into formal currency hedging transactions to\ndecrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rates of our principal operating currencies. These measures, however, may not\nadequately protect us from the material adverse effects of such fluctuations.\n86\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 92\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nImpact of Inflation and Currency Fluctuations\nOur functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. We incur some of our expenses in other currencies. As a result, we are exposed to the\nrisk that the rate of inflation in countries in which we are active other than the United States will exceed the rate of devaluation of such countries\ncurrencies in relation to the dollar or that the timing of any such devaluation will lag behind inflation in such countries. To date, we have been affected by\nthe exchange rates of other countries currencies compared to the dollar, and we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected in the future.\nThe annual rate of inflation in Israel was 2.8 % in 2021 and (0.7) % in 2020. The NIS revaluated against the U.S. dollar by approximately (3.3)\n% in 2021 and (7.0) % in 2020.\nITEM 12. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES OTHER THAN EQUITY SECURITIES\nA. Debt Securities.\nNot applicable.\nB. Warrants and rights.\nOn March 24, 2021, we issued warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 489,812 Ordinary Shares to the March 2021 Investors. Such warrants\nare exercisable until March 24, 2026, at an exercise price of $6.1248 per Ordinary Share.\nOn April 21, 2021 we entered into the Advisory Services Agreement with the Advisors to provide the Company with services related to a\npotential IPO of the Ordinary Shares. Pursuant to the Advisory Services Agreement, the Advisors were each issued warrants to purchase up to 90,204.5\nOrdinary Shares, exercisable until April 21, 2026, at an exercise price of $0.0004 per Ordinary Share. In addition, pursuant to the Advisory Services\nAgreement, following the completion of the IPO, the Company issued the Advisors warrants to purchase up to 400,472 Ordinary Shares, exercisable until\nFebruary 3, 2027, at an exercise price of $4.20.\nOn April 21, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Doron Afik, the managing partner of Afik & Co., who served as our Israeli legal advisor\nfor the IPO, pursuant to which following the completion of the IPO, we issued to such advisor warrants to purchase up to 145,506 Ordinary Shares. The\nwarrants are exercisable until February 3, 2027, at an exercise price of $4.20.\nOn February 4, 2022, we closed the IPO of (i) 3,690,477 Units, each consisting of one Ordinary Shares, and one warrant to purchase one\nordinary share, and (ii) 10,000 Pre-Funded Units, each consisting of one Pre-Funded Warrants to one Share and one Warrant, to those purchasers whose\npurchase of Units in the IPO would otherwise result in the purchaser, together with its affiliates and certain related parties, beneficially owning more than\n4.99% (or 9.99% in certain circumstances) of the outstanding Ordinary Shares immediately following the consummation of the IPO. The Units were sold\nat an IPO price of $4.20 per Unit and the Pre-Funded Units were sold at an IPO price of $4.199 per Pre-Funded Unit. The Warrants have an exercise price\nof $5.25 per Ordinary Share and may be exercised until February 4, 2027 and the Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price of $0.001 per Ordinary\nShare. In addition, the Company also issued and sold 65,247 Ordinary Shares at a price of $4.199, 478,324 Pre-Funded Warrants at a price of $4.198 per\nPre-Funded Warrant and 543,571 Warrants at a price of $0.001 per Warrant pursuant to the partial exercise of the over-allotment option and issued\n488,324 Ordinary Shares pursuant to the exercise of the 488,324 Pre-Funded Warrants issued in the IPO at an exercise price of $0.001 per Ordinary\nShare. In connection with the IPO (including over-allotment and Pre-Funded Warrant exercises), the Company issued and sold 4,244,048 Ordinary\nShares and 4,244,048 Warrants and received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $17.8 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and\ncommissions and before offering expenses.\nWe have also issued warrants to purchase up to 185,023 Ordinary Shares to the representative of the underwriters in the IPO, or the\nRepresentatives Warrants. The Representatives Warrants have an exercise price equal to $5.25, or 125% of the per Unit public offering price, are\nexercisable beginning on August 3, 2022, and will expire on February 4, 2027.\nC.

MATERIAL MODIFICATIONS TO THE RIGHTS OF SECURITY HOLDERS AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nIn connection with the IPO (including over-allotment and Pre-Funded Warrant exercises), the Company issued and sold 4,244,048 Ordinary\nShares and 4,244,048 Warrants and received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $17.8 million, before deducting underwriting discounts,\ncommissions and offering expenses.\nThe net proceeds from the offering have been used, and are expected to continue to be used, for the following purposes:\napproximately $4.0 million for research and development of new technologies as well as existing products;\napproximately $4.0 million for marketing and sales efforts in new territories (with emphasis on the U.S. market);\napproximately $1.2 million for the repayment of certain outstanding loans; and\nthe remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nITEM 15. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2021, or the\nEvaluation Date. Based on the material weaknesses identified in the Companys internal control over financial reporting as described below as of the\nEvaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis,\ninformation required to be included in periodic filings under the Exchange Act and that such information is accumulated and communicated to\nmanagement, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n(b) Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in\nRule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2021 based on the criteria set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on that assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over\nfinancial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2021, due to insufficient number of financial reporting personnel with an appropriate level of\nknowledge, experience and training in application of U.S. GAAP and SEC rules and regulations commensurate with our reporting requirements and\ninadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives.\nAs defined in Regulation 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in\ninternal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented, or detected on a timely basis.\nWe have taken action toward remediating these material weaknesses by hiring additional qualified personnel with U.S. GAAP accounting and\nreporting experience, and intend to provide enhanced training to existing financial and accounting employees on related U.S. GAAP issues. In addition, to\nremediate these material weaknesses, we are implementing measures including the following:\nwe have hired a chief financial officer with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience and are continuing to seek additional financial\nprofessionals such as corporate controller to increase the number of qualified financial reporting personnel and implement segregation of\nduties; and\nwe are developing, communicating and implementing an accounting policy manual for our financial reporting personnel for recurring\ntransactions, period-end closing processes and policy relating to segregation of duties.\nAlthough we believe there has been some progress in remediating this weakness, the implementation of these initiatives may not fully address\nany material weakness or other deficiencies that we may have in our internal control over financial reporting.\n88\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 94\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\n(c) Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis annual report does not include a report of managements assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation\nreport of the companys registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies.\n(d) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 16.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as related rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, require foreign private issuers, such as us, to comply\nwith various corporate governance practices. In addition, following the listing of the Ordinary Shares on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with the\nNasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules. Under those rules, we may elect to follow certain corporate governance practices permitted under the Companies\nLaw in lieu of compliance with corresponding corporate governance requirements otherwise imposed by the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules for U.S.\ndomestic issuers.\nIn accordance with Israeli law and practice and subject to the exemption set forth in Rule 5615 of the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, we\nhave elected to follow the provisions of the Companies Law, rather than the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, with respect to the following\nrequirements:\nQuorum. While the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules require that the quorum for purposes of any meeting of the holders of a listed\ncompanys common voting stock, as specified in the companys bylaws, be no less than 33 1/3% of the companys outstanding common\nvoting stock, under Israeli law, a company is entitled to determine in its articles of association the number of shareholders and percentage of\nholdings required for a quorum at a shareholders meeting. The Companies Law provides that a quorum of two or more shareholders holding\nat least 25% of the voting rights in person or by proxy is required for commencement of business at a general meeting. However, the\nquorum set forth in our articles of association with respect to an adjourned meeting consists of at least one shareholders present in person or\nby proxy.\n90\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 96\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nNomination of our directors.

Israeli law and our articles of association do not require that the independent members of our board of directors\n(or a compensation committee composed solely of independent members of our board of directors) determine an executive officers\ncompensation, as is generally required under the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules with respect to the chief executive officer and all other\nexecutive officers. Instead, compensation of executive officers is determined and approved by our compensation committee and our board\nof directors, and in certain circumstances by our shareholders, either in consistency with our office holder compensation policy or, in special\ncircumstances in deviation therefrom, taking into account certain considerations stated in the Companies Law (see Management  Board\nPractices  Approval of Related Party Transactions under Israeli Law for additional information).\nShareholder approval. We will seek shareholder approval for all corporate actions requiring such approval under the requirements of the\nCompanies Law, rather than seeking approval for corporation actions in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635. In particular, under this\nNasdaq listing rule, shareholder approval is generally required for: (i) an acquisition of shares/assets of another company that involves the\nissuance of 20% or more of the acquirers shares or voting rights or if a director, officer or 5% shareholder has greater than a 5% interest in\nthe target company or the consideration to be received; (ii) the issuance of shares leading to a change of control; (iii) adoption/amendment\nof equity compensation arrangements (although under the provisions of the Companies Law there is no requirement for shareholder\napproval for the adoption/amendment of the equity compensation plan); and (iv) issuances of 20% or more of the shares or voting rights\n(including securities convertible into, or exercisable for, equity) of a listed company via a private placement (and/or via sales by\ndirectors/officers/5% shareholders) if such equity is issued (or sold) at below the greater of the book or market value of shares. By contrast,\nunder the Companies Law, shareholder approval is required for, among other things: (i) transactions with directors concerning the terms of\ntheir service or indemnification, exemption and insurance for their service (or for any other position that they may hold at a company), for\nwhich approvals of the compensation committee, board of directors and shareholders are all required, (ii) extraordinary transactions with\ncontrolling shareholders of publicly held companies, which require the special approval, and (iii) terms of employment or other engagement\nof the controlling shareholder of us or such controlling shareholders relative, which require special approval. In addition, under the\nCompanies Law, a merger requires approval of the shareholders of each of the merging companies.\nApproval of Related Party Transactions. All related party transactions are approved in accordance with the requirements and procedures for\napproval of interested party acts and transaction as set forth in the Companies Law, which requires the approval of the audit committee, or\nthe compensation committee, as the case may be, the board of directors and shareholders, as may be applicable, for specified transactions,\nrather than approval by the audit committee or other independent body of our board of directors as required under the Nasdaq Stock Market\nListing Rules (see Management  Board Practices  Approval of Related Party Transactions under Israeli Law for additional\ninformation).\nAnnual Shareholders Meeting. As opposed to the Nasdaq listing Rule 5620(a), which mandates that a listed company hold its annual\nshareholders meeting within one year of the companys fiscal year-end, we are required, under the Companies Law, to hold an annual\nshareholder meeting each calendar year and within 15 months of the last annual shareholders meeting.\nDistribution of periodic reports to shareholders; proxy solicitation. As opposed to the Nasdaq Stock Market Listing Rules, which require\nlisted issuers to make such reports available to shareholders in one of a number of specific manners, Israeli law does not require us to\ndistribute periodic reports directly to shareholders, and the generally accepted business practice in Israel is not to distribute such reports to\nshareholders but to make such reports available through a public website. In addition to making such reports available on a public website,\nwe currently make our audited financial statements available to our shareholders at our offices and will only mail such reports to\nshareholders upon request. As a foreign private issuer, we are generally exempt from the SECs proxy solicitation rules.\nITEM 16H. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE\nNot applicable.\nITEM 16I.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related statements of\noperations, changes in shareholders capital deficiency and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the\nrelated notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The\nCompany is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are\nrequired to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompanys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures\nin the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Kesselman & Kesselman\nCertified Public Accountants (Isr.)\nA member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited\nHaifa, Israel\nApril 28, 2022\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nKesselman & Kesselman, Building 25, MATAM, P.O BOX 15084 Haifa, 3190500, Israel\nTelephone: +972 -4- 8605000, Fax:+972 -4- 8605001, www.pwc.com/il\nF-2\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 103\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nBalance Sheets\nU.S. dollars\nDecember 31,\n2021 2020\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 785 $ 20,524\nRestricted deposits -

Introduction\nMaris-Tech Ltd. (the Company) was incorporated in 2008, in Israel. The Company develops, designs and manufactures high-end digital video\nand audio products and solutions for the professional as well as the civilian and home security markets, which can be sold off the shelf or fully\ncustomized to meet customers requirements.\nThe Company operates in Israel and sells to customers in other countries, including the United Kingdom and Switzerland.\nB. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and has relied on its ability to fund its\noperations primarily through proceeds from sales of ordinary shares and warrant of the Company, no par value (the Ordinary Shares), loans\nfrom banks and long-term loans from shareholders. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had a working capital deficit of\n$1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively, and an accumulated deficit of $4.5 million and $3.7 million, respectively, and negative cash flow\nfrom operating activity of $0.9 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company\nanticipates such losses will continue until its products reach commercial profitability. If the Company is unable to successfully commercialize its\nproduct candidates and reach profitability, or obtain sufficient future financing through debt or issuance of equity, it will be required to delay\nsome of its planned research and development programs.\nFurthermore, on March 24, 2021, the Company issued 489,812 preferred shares of the Company, no par value (Preferred Shares), and warrants\nto purchase up to an aggregate of 489,812 Ordinary Shares, to certain investors (the March 2021 Investors) in a private placement for\naggregate gross proceeds of $1.5 million.\nOn February 2, 2022, the Company closed an initial public offering (IPO) of 4,244,088 shares and 4,244,088 warrants, in which each warrant\nto purchase one ordinary share. Companys Net proceeds from the IPO was approximately $15 million (see Note 18A).\nDuring February 2022, the Company repaid its liabilities to the banks and Yaad in the total amount of approx. $1.2 million and released of\npersonal guarantees securing certain of those loans. In addition, the Company released all the collaterals it provided to the banks (See note 7A).\nTherefore, based on the receipt of the proceeds from IPO and managements projections of the business results for the next twelve months,\nmanagement concluded that the Company has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its obligations over the next twelve months. Accordingly, the\nfinancial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the\nrealization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.\nF-8\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 109\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nU.S. dollars\nNote 1  General (Continued)\nIn connection with the outbreak of COVID-19, the Company has taken steps to protect its workforce in Israel. Such steps include work from\nhome where possible, minimizing face-to-face meetings and utilizing video conference as much as possible, social distancing at facilities and\nelimination of all international travel. The Company continues to comply with all local health directives.\nThe Company received during the year ended December 31, 2021 COVID-19 related government grants in an aggregate amount of $11\nthousand to participate in the Companys recurring expenses during the pandemic period.\nAnother impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been on product delivery, where the lead time to procure component parts is longer and a\nshortage in supply of component parts has increased as the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic has continued. As long as the COVID-19\npandemic continues, the lead time to obtain component parts may be longer than normal and shortage in supply of component parts may\ncontinue or worsen. Therefore, the Company maintains a comprehensive network of world-wide suppliers.\nC. Reverse stock split\nOn August 25, 2021, the General meeting of shareholders approved an amendment to the Articles of Association giving effect to a 4:1 reverse\nstock split. The number of authorized shares was affected by the reverse stock split. References made to authorized shares, outstanding shares\nand per share amounts in the accompanying financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this\nreverse stock split.\nNote 2  Significant Accounting Policies\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.\nGAAP).\nThe significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements, applied on a consistent basis, are as follows:\nA. Functional Currency\nSubstantially most of the Companys revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. A main portion of purchases of materials, component parts and\nsales costs are denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, both the functional and reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar.\nAccordingly, monetary balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S dollar are converted into U.S dollars in accordance with\nStatements of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters. All transaction gain and losses of the\nconverted monetary balance sheet items are reflected in the statements of operations, among financial expenses, net, as appropriate.\nB. Estimates and assumptions\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses during reported period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. As applicable for these\nfinancial statements, the most significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition, valuation of inventories, and provision for\nwarranty.\nF-9\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 110\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nU.S. dollars\nNote 2  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nC. Cash equivalents\nCash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments and debt instruments that are readily convertible to cash with original maturities of\nthree months or less from the date of purchase.\nD. Bank deposits\nBank deposits with original maturities of more than three months, or specific deposits that are intended to be held as bank deposits for more than\nthree months, and which will mature within one year, are classified as short-term investments.\nE. Trade receivables\nTrade receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The financial statements include an allowance for doubtful\naccounts for which collection of the receivable is not probable and as of December 31, 2021 the allowance was negligible. In determining the\nadequacy of the allowance, consideration is given to each trade receivable historical experience, aging of the receivable, adjusted to take into\naccount current market conditions and information available about specific debtors, including their financial condition, current payment patterns,\nthe volume of their operations, and evaluation of the security received from them or their guarantors.\nF. Inventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by calculating raw materials, work in process and finished\nproducts on a weighted average cost basis. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less\nreasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Inventory write-offs are provided to cover risks arising from slow\nmoving items or technological obsolescence. Such write-offs have been included in cost of revenues. Reserves for potentially excess and\nobsolete inventory are made based on managements analysis of inventory levels, future sales forecasts. Once established, the original cost of\nour inventory less the related inventory reserve represents the new cost basis of such products.\nG. Property, plant and equipment, net\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\nYears\nComputers, software and manufacturing equipment 3-7\nOffice furniture and equipment 17\nH. Revenue recognition\nThe Company generates revenues from sales of products manufactured based on the Companys technology. The Company develops, design and\nmanufactures both standard and customizable high-end digital Video & Audio products. The Companys products include proprietary software\n(firmware) embedded into the tangible products and is not sold separately. The Company only sells its product to end customer with no right of\nreturn.\nF-10\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 111\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nU.S. dollars\nNote 2  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nThe Company applies ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue\nwhen its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in\nexchange for those goods or services.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, the entity performs the following five steps:\n(1) Identify the contract(s) with a customer,\n(2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract,\n(3) Determine the transaction price,\n(4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and\n(5) Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nIdentifying the contract with a customer:\nThe Company accounts for a contract with a customer when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties and\npayment terms are identified and agreed upon, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable\nFor each contract, the Company exercises judgement to identify separate performance obligations and to evaluate, at the inception of the\ncontract, if each distinct performance obligation within the contract is satisfied at a point in time or over time.\nIdentifying the performance obligations in the contract:\nThe Companys sales transactions include a single performance obligation which is the delivery of the product to the customer. The Company is\nnot obligated and does not provide the customer with an updated version of the products embedded software following the initial transaction.\nTherefore, the Companys transactions do not include any performance obligation relating to potential upgrades or updates for the software or\nproduct.\nIn certain cases, the Company customizes its products based on its customers requirements (Proof of Concept  POC transactions). In addition,\ncommencing 2021, the Company also enters into several transactions in which it develops a specialized product, based on the Costumers\nrequirements (NRE transactions). In these transactions, the Company has determined that the development or the customization and the delivery\nof these products are not distinct within the context of the contract, since the nature of the Companys promise is to transfer a combined output\nto which each of these components is an input. Therefore, these transactions include a single performance obligation which is the customized\nproduct.\nDetermining the transaction price:\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts\ncollected on behalf of third parties (such as sales tax). The Companys transaction does not include a significant financing component as all\namounts are due within few months from transfer of Control.\nRecognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation:\nThe Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over its product to a customer based on the\nshipment terms. In most cases, control is transferred at Companys premises (Ex-work terms).\nF-11\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 112\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nU.S. dollars\nNote 2  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nAs for the POC and NRE transactions, the Company analyzed the criteria in ASC 606 to determine whether control over products sold under\nPOC contracts is transferred over time. Mainly, whether the Companys performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the\nCompany, and if it has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. In its POC transactions, the Company has an\nenforceable right to payment for performance completed through the term of the contract with its customers. However, the customized product\nhas an alternative use for the Company, therefore, none of the conditions stipulated in ASC 606 are met for recognizing revenue over time.\nAccordingly, revenue from POC transactions is recognized at a point in time, upon delivery of the product to the customer.\nIn the NRE transactions the Company determines that the specialized product does not have an alternative use for the Company and it has an\nenforceable right to payment for performance completed through the term of the contract. Therefore, in these transactions, revenue is recognized\nover time.\nSee also Note 10 for further information regarding the Companys revenue transactions\nI. Deferred issuance costs\nThe Company capitalizes certain legal, professional accounting and other third-party fees that are directly associated with the proposed IPO, as\ndeferred costs until such IPO is consummated. Upon consummation of the IPO, these fees will be recorded in the stockholders equity as a\nreduction of additional paid-in capital generated as a result of the activity. The deferred issuance costs in the amount of $871,171 which\ncapitalized as of December 31, 2021 in long term assets were charged to equity in the first quarter of 2022 in conjunction with the IPO.\nJ. Warrant classification\nWhen the Company issues freestanding instruments, it first analyzes the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 480\ndistinguishing liabilities from equity (ASC 480) in order to determine whether the instrument should be classified as a liability, with\nsubsequent changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations in each period. If the instrument is not within the scope of ASC 480,\nthe Company further analyzes the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 815 derivatives and hedging (ASC 815-10) in\norder to determine whether the instrument is considered indexed to the entitys own stock, and qualifies for classification within equity. If the\nprovisions of ASC 815-10 for equity classification are not met, the instrument is classified as a liability, with subsequent changes in fair value\nrecognized in the statements of operations in each period.\nK. Warranty reserve\nThe Company provides a one-year standard warranty for its products. The Company records a provision for the estimated cost to repair or\nreplace products under warranty at the time of sale. Factors that affect the Companys warranty reserve include the number of units sold,\nhistorical and anticipated rates of warranty repairs and the cost per repair. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded\nwarranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.\nF-12\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 113\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nU.S. dollars\nNote 2  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nThe following table sets forth activity in the Companys accrued warranty account for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nrespectively:\n2021 2020\nBalance at beginning of the year 9,879 8,930\nCost incurred (5,850) -\nExpense recognized 16,729 949\nBalance at end of year 20,758 9,879\nI. Research, development costs and intangible assets\nResearch and development costs, which consist mainly of labor costs, materials and subcontractor costs, are charged to operations as incurred.\nAccording to ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, software that is part of a product or process to be sold to a customer shall be\naccounted for under ASC Subtopic 985-20. The Companys products contain embedded software which is an integral part of these products\nbecause it allows the various components of the products to communicate with each other and the products are clearly unable to function without\nthis coding. Based on the Companys product development process, the Company does not incur material costs after the point in time at which\nthe product as a whole reaches technological feasibility. Therefore, research and development costs are charged to the statement of operations as\nincurred.\nL. Basic and diluted net loss per share\nBasic and diluted net loss per Ordinary Share is computed based on the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during each\nyear. Shares issuable, are considered outstanding Ordinary Shares including the preferred shares and included in the computation of basic net\nloss per Ordinary Share as of the date that all necessary conditions have been satisfied.\nWarrants to purchase Ordinary Shares, including warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares classified as liability, as mentioned in Note 11, in the\namount of 489,812 outstanding as of December 31, 2021, have been excluded from the calculation of the diluted net profit per Ordinary Share\ndue to the fact that all such securities have an anti-dilutive effect for the reporting period.\nM. Fair value of financial instruments\nThe Companys financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, short-term interest bearing investments, accounts receivable,\nrestricted deposits for employee benefits, accounts payable, warrants, short-term and long-term loans.\nF-13\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 114\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nU.S. dollars\nNote 2  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nFair value for the measurement of financial assets and liabilities is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that\nshould be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company utilizes a valuation\nhierarchy for disclosure of the inputs for fair value measurement. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:\nLevel 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the\nmeasurement date.\nLevel 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly,\nfor substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available,\nthereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.\nBy distinguishing between inputs that are observable in the market place, and therefore more objective, and those that are unobservable and\ntherefore more subjective, the hierarchy is designed to indicate the relative reliability of the fair value measurements. A financial asset or\nliabilitys classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe Company, in estimating fair value for financial instruments, determined that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade\nreceivables, short-term bank credit, trade payables, short term loans from shareholders are equivalent to, or approximate their fair value due to\nthe short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amounts of variable interest rate long-term loans are equivalent or approximate to\ntheir fair value as they bear interest at approximate market rates. The liabilities include long-term loans from shareholders that do not bear any\ninterest, but taking into account the schedule of its maturities and its amount are approximate to their fair value.\nN. Segments\nThe Company operates in one segment. Management does not segregate its business for internal reporting. The Companys chief operating\ndecision maker (CODM) evaluates the performance of its business based on financial data consistent with the presentation in the\naccompanying financial statements. The Company concluded that its unified business is conducted globally and accordingly represents one\noperating segment.\nO. Income taxes\nThe Company accounts for taxes on income in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which prescribes the use of the asset and liability\nmethod whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax\nbases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to\nreverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value if it is more\nlikely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence.\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are classified as non-current in accordance with ASU 2015-17.\nF-14\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 115\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nU.S. dollars\nNote 2  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740-10. ASC 740-10 contains a two-step approach to recognizing\nand measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if\nthe weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that, on an evaluation of the technical merits, the tax position will be\nsustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest\namount that is more than 50% (cumulative probability) likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nThe Company accounts for interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.\nP. Severance pay\nThe Companys liability for severance pay for some of its Israeli employees is calculated pursuant to Israeli Severance Pay Law, 1963 (the\nIsraeli Severance Pay Law) based on the most recent salary of the employee multiplied by the number of years of employment, as of the\nbalance sheet date. Those employees are entitled to one months salary for each year of employment or a portion thereof. The Company records\nthe liability as if it were payable at each balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis.\nThe Companys liability for those Israeli employees is provided for by monthly deposits for insurance policies and the remainder by an accrual.\nThe value of these policies is recorded as an asset in the Companys balance sheet.\nThe deposited funds include profits and losses accumulated up to the balance sheet date. The deposited funds may be withdrawn only upon the\nfulfillment of the obligation pursuant to the Israeli Severance Pay Law or labor agreements. The value of the deposited funds is based on the\ncash surrender value of these policies.\nSeverance pay expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 amounted to $ 31,356 , $22,247 and $18,074, respectively.\nQ. Concentrations of credit or business risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, bank deposits,\ntrade receivables and trade payables.\nCash equivalents are invested mainly in NIS and U.S. dollars with major banks in Israel. Management believes that the financial institutions that\nhold the Companys investments are financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these investments.\nMost of the Companys trade receivables are derived from sales to large and financially secure organizations. In determining the adequacy of the\nallowance, management bases its opinion, inter alia, on the estimated risks, current market conditions and in reliance on available information\nwith respect to the debtors financial position. See Note 14 for a discussion of the Companys major customers.\nThe Company acquires certain component parts for its products from market leading suppliers that are single source manufacturers. In order to\nmitigate the risk and as a redundant solution, the Company designs similar products based on component parts from different suppliers.\nF-15\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 116\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nU.S. dollars\nNote 2  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nR. Commitments and contingencies\nLiabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigations, fines and penalties and other sources are recognized when it is\nprobable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Loss recovery related to recovery of a\nloss when the recovery is less than or equal to the amount of the loss recognized in the financial statements is recognized if collection is probable\nand estimable. Gain contingencies are recognized only when resolved.\nS. Cash and cash equivalents in Statement of Cash Flows\nThe Company implements the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which\nrequires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included within cash and cash equivalents when\nreconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown in the statement of cash flows.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents reported within the\naccompanying balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts presented in the accompanying statements of cash flows:\nDecember 31,\n2021 2020\nCash and cash equivalents $ 785 $ 20,524\nRestricted deposits 48,341 33,847\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted deposits presented in the statements of cash flows $ 49,126 $ 54,371\nT. Recently issued accounting pronouncements adopted\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued ASU 2020-06 Debt  Debt with Conversion and Other\nOptions (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging  Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815  40). (ASU 2020-06). This\nguidance simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible\ninstruments and contracts on an entitys own equity. The amendments to this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after\nDecember 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company decided to early adopt ASU 2020-06 as of January 1, 2021. The\nadoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Companys financial statements.\nF-16\nf20f2021_maristechltd.htm Form Type: 20-F Page 117\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nMaris-Tech Ltd.\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nU.S. dollars\nNote 2  Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nU. Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nAs an emerging growth company, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act) allows the Company to delay adoption of\nnew or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies.\nThe Company has elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. The adoption dates discussed below reflect this election.\n1) In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update leases ASU 2016-02 regarding FASB Accounting Standards\nCodification Topic 842 leases ASC 842. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for those leases\nclassified as operating leases under previous FASB guidance. The guidance will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning on\nor after December 15, 2021, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2022, and requires modified\nretrospective adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its financial statements and related\ndisclosures.\n2) In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments  Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments (ASU 2016-13), which replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected credit loss model and\nrequires a financial asset measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The guidance will be\neffective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is\ncurrently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.\nNote 3  Restricted Deposits\nBalances at December 31, 2021 and 2020 consist of bank deposits. The bank deposits bore annual interest of 0.3% and 0.9% as of December 31,\n2021 and 2020, accordingly.\nRestricted deposits, as of December 31, 2021, are restricted due to guarantees made with regards to lease payments for the Companys office\nspace.

If more than one director served the longest\ntime, the board of directors will decide which of such directors will be brought for re-election at the relevant general meeting.\nAnnual and Special Meetings\nUnder the Israeli law, we are required to hold an annual general meeting of our shareholders once every calendar year, at such time and place which\nshall be determined by our Board of directors, that must be no later than 15 months after the date of the previous annual general meeting.

If within half an hour of the time set forth for the general meeting a quorum is not present, the general meeting shall stand adjourned the same day\nof the following week, at the same hour and in the same place, or to such other date, time and place as prescribed in the notice to the shareholders and in\nsuch adjourned meeting, if no quorum is present within half an hour of the time arranged, any number of shareholders participating in the meeting, shall\nconstitute a quorum.\nIf a special general meeting was summoned following the request of a shareholder, and within half an hour a legal quorum shall not have been\nformed, the meeting shall be canceled.\nAdoption of Resolutions\nOur articles of association provide that resolutions amending provisions of the articles of association related to the staggered board of directors and\nthe composition of the board of directors, as well as a resolution to dismiss a director, will require an affirmative vote of 70% of the voting power\nrepresented at a general meeting and voting thereon. Other than that, and unless otherwise required under the Companies Law, all resolutions of the\nCompanys shareholders require a simple majority vote. A shareholder may vote in a general meeting in person, by proxy, by a written ballot.\nChanging Rights Attached to Shares\nUnless otherwise provided by the terms of the shares and subject to any applicable law, any modification of rights attached to any class of shares\nmust be adopted by the holders of a majority of the shares of that class present a general meeting of the affected class or by a written consent of all the\nshareholders of the affected class.\nThe enlargement of an existing class of shares or the issuance of additional shares thereof, shall not be deemed to modify the rights attached to the\npreviously issued shares of such class or of any other class, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the shares.\nLimitations on the Right to Own Securities in Our Company\nThere are no limitations on the right to own our securities in our articles of association. In certain circumstances the IPO Warrants have restrictions\nupon the exercise of such warrants if such exercise would result in the holders thereof owning more than 4.99% or 9.99% of our Ordinary Shares upon\nsuch exercise, as further described below.\nProvisions Restricting Change in Control of Our Company\nOur articles of association provide for a staggered board of directors, which mechanism may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of the\nCompanys board of directors. Other than that, there are no specific provisions of our articles of association that would have an effect of delaying,\ndeferring or preventing a change in control of the Company or that would operate only with respect to a merger, acquisition or corporate restructuring\ninvolving us. However, as described below, certain provisions of the Companies Law may have such effect.\n3\nf20f2021ex2-5_maristechltd.htm Form Type: EX-2.5 Page 4\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nThe Companies Law includes provisions that allow a merger transaction and requires that each company that is a party to the merger have the\ntransaction approved by its board of directors and, unless certain requirements described under the Companies Law are met, a vote of the majority of\nshareholders, and, in the case of the target company, also a majority vote of each class of its shares. For purposes of the shareholder vote of each party,\nunless a court rules otherwise, the merger will not be deemed approved if shares representing a majority of the voting power present at the shareholders\nmeeting and which are not held by the other party to the merger (or by any person or group of persons acting in concert who holds 25% or more of the\nvoting power or the right to appoint 25% or more of the directors of the other party) vote against the merger. If, however, the merger involves a merger\nwith a companys own controlling shareholder or if the controlling shareholder has a personal interest in the merger, then the merger is instead subject to\nthe same special majority approval that governs all extraordinary transactions with controlling shareholders. Upon the request of a creditor of either party\nto the proposed merger, the court may delay or prevent the merger if it concludes that there exists a reasonable concern that as a result of the merger the\nsurviving company will be unable to satisfy the obligations of any of the parties to the merger, and may further give instructions to secure the rights of\ncreditors. If the transaction would have been approved by the shareholders of a merging company but for the separate approval of each class or the\nexclusion of the votes of certain shareholders as provided above, a court may still approve the merger upon the petition of holders of at least 25% of the\nvoting rights of a company. For such petition to be granted, the court must find that the merger is fair and reasonable, taking into account the value of the\nparties to the merger and the consideration offered to the shareholders. In addition, a merger may not be completed unless at least (1) 50 days have passed\nfrom the time that the requisite proposals for approval of the merger were filed with the Israeli Registrar of Companies by each merging company and (2)\n30 days have passed since the merger was approved by the shareholders of each merging company.\nThe term Special Majority hereof will be defined as described in section 275(a)(3) of the Companies Law as:\nat least a majority of the shares held by shareholders who are not controlling shareholders and do not have personal interest in the merger\n(excluding a personal interest that did not result from the shareholders relationship with the controlling shareholder) have voted in favor of the\nproposal (shares held by abstaining shareholders shall not be considered); or\nthe total number of shares voted against the merger, does not exceed 2% of the aggregate voting rights of the company.\nThe Companies Law also provides that, subject to certain exceptions, an acquisition of shares in an Israeli public company must be made by means\nof a special tender offer if as a result of the acquisition (1) the purchaser would become a holder of 25% or more of the voting rights in the company,\nunless there is already another holder of at least 25% or more of the voting rights in the company or (2) the purchaser would become a holder of 45% or\nmore of the voting rights in the company, unless there is already a holder of more than 45% of the voting rights in the company. These requirements do\nnot apply if, in general, the acquisition (1) was made in a private placement that received shareholders approval, subject to certain conditions, (2) was\nfrom a holder of 25% or more of the voting rights in the company which resulted in the acquirer becoming a holder of 25% or more of the voting rights in\nthe company, or (3) was from a holder of more than 45% of the voting rights in the company which resulted in the acquirer becoming a holder of more\nthan 45% of the voting rights in the company. A special tender offer must be extended to all shareholders. In general, a special tender offer may be\nconsummated only if (1) at least 5% of the voting power attached to the companys outstanding shares will be acquired by the offeror and (2) the offer is\naccepted by a majority of the offerees who notified the company of their position in connection with such offer (excluding the offeror, controlling\nshareholders, holders of 25% or more of the voting rights in the company or anyone on their behalf, or any person having a personal interest in the\nacceptance of the tender offer). If a special tender offer is accepted, then the purchaser or any person or entity controlling it or under common control\nwith the purchaser or such controlling person or entity may not make a subsequent tender offer for the purchase of shares of the target company and may\nnot enter into a merger with the target company for a period of one year from the date of the offer, unless the purchaser or such person or entity undertook\nto effect such an offer or merger in the initial special tender offer.\n4\nf20f2021ex2-5_maristechltd.htm Form Type: EX-2.5 Page 5\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nIf, as a result of an acquisition of shares, the acquirer will hold more than 90% of an Israeli companys outstanding shares or of certain class of\nshares, the acquisition must be made by means of a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares, or for all of the outstanding shares of such class, as\napplicable. In general, if less than 5% of the outstanding shares, or of applicable class, are not tendered in the tender offer and more than half of the\nofferees who have no personal interest in the offer tendered their shares, all the shares that the acquirer offered to purchase will be transferred to it by\noperation of law. However, a tender offer will also be accepted if the shareholders who do not accept the offer hold less than 2% of the issued and\noutstanding share capital of the company or of the applicable class of shares. Any shareholders that was an offeree in such tender offer, whether such\nshareholder accepted the tender offer or not, may request, by petition to an Israeli court, (i) appraisal rights in connection with a full tender offer, and (ii)\nthat the fair value should be paid as determined by the court, for a period of six months following the acceptance thereof. However, the acquirer is\nentitled to stipulate, under certain conditions, that tendering shareholders will forfeit such appraisal rights.\nLastly, Israeli tax law treats some acquisitions, such as stock-for-stock exchanges between an Israeli company and a foreign company, less\nfavorably than U.S. tax laws. For example, Israeli tax law may, under certain circumstances, subject a shareholder who exchanges his Ordinary Shares for\nshares in another corporation to taxation prior to the sale of the shares received in such stock-for-stock swap.\nChanges in Our Capital\nThe general meeting may, by a simple majority vote of the shareholders attending the general meeting:\nincrease our registered share capital by the creation of new shares from the existing class or a new class, as determined by the general meeting;\ncancel any registered share capital which have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person;\nconsolidate and divide all or any of our share capital into shares of larger nominal value than our existing shares;\nsubdivide our existing shares or any of them, our share capital or any of it, into shares of smaller nominal value than is fixed; and\nreduce our share capital and any fund reserved for capital redemption in any manner, and with and subject to any incident authorized, and\nconsent required, by the Companies Law.\nExclusive Forum\nOur articles of association provide that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of\nthe United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act\nof 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act and that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any security of the Company,\nshall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this exclusive forum provision.\nStaggered Board\nOur articles of association provide for a split of the board of directors into three classes with staggered three-year terms. At each annual general\nmeeting of our shareholders, the election or re-election of directors following the expiration of the term of office of the directors of that class of directors\nwill be for a term of office that expires on the third annual general meeting following such election or re-election, such that each year the term of office of\nonly one class of directors will expire. The director whom is to be retired and re-elected shall be the director that served the longest period since its\nappointment or last re-election or, if more than one director served the longest time, or if a director who is not to be re-elected agrees to be re-elected, the\nmeeting of the board of directors which sets the date and agenda for the annual general meeting (acting by a simple majority) will decide which of such\ndirectors will be brought for re-election at the relevant general meeting.\n5\nf20f2021ex2-5_maristechltd.htm Form Type: EX-2.5 Page 6\nEdgar Agents LLC Maris-Tech Ltd. 04/28/2022 10:51 AM\nIPO Warrants\nThe following summary of certain terms and provisions of the IPO Warrants and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the provisions of the\nwarrant agent agreement between us and VStock Transfer, LLC, as warrant agent, and the form of Warrant, both of which are filed as exhibits to the\nAnnual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nExercisability\nThe IPO Warrants are exercisable at any time after their original issuance and at any time up to the date that is five years after their original\nissuance.

Relationships with the Company’s stakeholders, for example suppliers, competitors and customers, should not in any way affect an Covered Person’s responsibility and accountability to the Company. Conflicts of interest can arise when a Covered Person or a member of his or her family receive improper gifts, entertainment or benefits as a result of his or her position in the Company. Specifically, each Covered Person must:\n\n    1. act with integrity, including being honest and candid, while still maintaining the confidentiality of information when required or consistent with the Company’s policies;\n    2. avoid violations of the Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the Company in personal and professional relationships;\n    3. disclose to the Board or the Audit Committee any material transaction or relationship that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a breach of the Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the Company;\n    4. obtain approval from the Board or Audit Committee before making any decisions or taking any action that could reasonably be expected to involve a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest;\n    5. observe both the form and spirit of laws and governmental rules and regulations, accounting standards and Company policies;\n    6. maintain a high standard of accuracy and completeness in the Company’s financial records;\n    7. ensure full, fair, timely, accurate and understandable disclosure in the Company’s periodic reports;\n    8. report any violations of the Code to the Board or Audit Committee;\n    9. proactively promote ethical behavior among peers in his or her work environment; and\n    10. maintain the skills appropriate and necessary for the performance of his or her duties.\n\n##### DISCLOSURE OF COMPANY INFORMATION\n\nAs a result of the Company’s status as a public company, it is required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC. The Company takes its public disclosure responsibility seriously to ensure that these reports furnish the marketplace with full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure regarding the financial and business condition of the Company. All disclosures contained in reports and documents filed with or submitted to the SEC, or other government agencies, on behalf of the Company, or contained in other public communications made by the Company, must be complete and correct in all material respects and understandable to the intended recipient.\n\nThe Senior Officers, in relation to his or her area of responsibility, must be committed to providing timely, consistent and accurate information, in compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements. It is imperative that this disclosure be accomplished consistently during both good times and bad and that all parties in the marketplace have equal or similar access to this information.\n\nAll of the Company’s books, records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in reasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the Company’s transactions, and must conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the Company’s system of internal controls. Unrecorded or “off the book” funds, assets or liabilities should not be maintained unless permitted by applicable law or regulation. Senior Officers involved in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements must prepare those statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, and any other applicable accounting standards and rules so that the financial statements materially, fairly and completely reflect the business transactions and financial statements and related condition of the Company. Further, it is important that financial statements and related disclosures be free of material errors.\n\nSpecifically, each Senior Officer must:\n\n    1. familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Company;\n    2. not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, including the Company’s independent auditors, governmental regulators, self-regulating organizations and other governmental officials;\n    3. to the extent that he or she participates in the creation of the Company’s books and records, promote the accuracy, fairness and timeliness of those records; and\n    4. in relation to his or her area of responsibility, properly review and critically analyze proposed disclosure for accuracy and completeness.\n\n##### CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n\nCovered Persons must maintain the confidentiality of confidential information entrusted to them by the Company of its customers, suppliers, joint venture partners, or others with whom the Company is considering a business or other transaction, except when disclosure is authorized by a Senior Officer or required or mandated by laws or regulations. Confidential information includes all non-public information that might be useful or helpful to competitors or harmful to the Company or its customers or suppliers, if disclosed. It also includes information that suppliers, customers and other parties have entrusted to the Company. The obligation to preserve confidential information continues even after employment ends.\n\nRecords containing personal data about employees or private information about customers and their employees are confidential. They are to be carefully safeguarded, kept current, relevant and accurate. They should be disclosed only to authorized personnel or as required by law.\n\nAll inquiries regarding the Company from non-employees, such as financial analysts and journalists, should be directed to a Senior Officer, the Board or the Audit Committee. The Company’s policy is to cooperate with every reasonable request of government investigators for information. At the same time, the Company is entitled to all the safeguards provided by law for the benefit of persons under investigation or accused of wrongdoing, including legal representation. If a representative of any government or government agency seeks an interview or requests access to data or documents for the purposes of an investigation, the Covered Person should refer the representative to a Senior Officer, the Board or the Audit Committee. Covered Persons also should preserve all materials, including documents and e-mails, that might relate to any pending or reasonably possible investigation.\n\n##### COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS\n\nCovered Persons must respect and obey all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations applicable to the business and operations of the Company.\n\nCovered Persons who have access to, or knowledge of, material nonpublic information from or about the Company are prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise trading in the Company’s stock or other securities. “Material nonpublic information” includes any information, positive or negative, that has not yet been made available or disclosed to the public and that might be of significance to an investor, as part of the total mix of information, in deciding whether to buy or sell stock or other securities.\n\nCovered Persons also are prohibited from giving “tips” on material nonpublic information, that is directly or indirectly disclosing such information to any other person, including family members, other relatives and friends, so that they may trade in the Company’s stock or other securities.\n\nFurthermore, if, during the course of an Covered Person’s service with the Company, he or she acquires material nonpublic information about another company, such as one of the Company’s customers or suppliers, or if he or she learns that the Company is planning a major transaction with another company (such as an acquisition), the Covered Person is restricted from trading in the securities of the other company. The Company also maintains an Insider Trading Policy, which each Covered Person must review and comply with.\n\n##### REPORTING ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE\n\nThe Company, through the Board or the Audit Committee, is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions may arise and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.\n\nThis Code is not intended to provide a comprehensive guideline for Covered Persons in relation to their business activities with the Company. Any Covered Person may seek clarification on the application of this Code from the Board or the Audit Committee.\n\nEach Covered Person must:\n\n    1. notify the Company of any existing or potential violation of this Code, and failure to do so is itself a breach of the Code; and\n    2. not retaliate, directly or indirectly, or encourage others to do so, against any Covered Person for reports, made in good faith, of any misconduct or violations of the Code solely because that Covered Person raised a legitimate ethical issue.\n    3. The Company installed a physical box where an employees may report any compliance concerns and be assured their identity will be protected and kept anonymous. Moreover employees may send an email to the following email: doron@kreston.co.il. In addition, the company provides periodic training for all employees on the Code of Ethics and the use of the “hotline” box and email.\n\nThe Board or the Audit Committee will take all actions it considers appropriate to investigate any breach of the Code reported to it. All Covered Persons are required to cooperate fully with any such investigations and to provide truthful and accurate information. If the Board or the Audit Committee determines that a breach has occurred, it will take or authorize disciplinary or preventative action as it deems appropriate, after consultation with the Company’s counsel if warranted, up to and including termination of employment. Where appropriate, the Company will not limit itself to disciplinary action but may pursue legal action against the offending Covered Person involved. In some cases, the Company may have a legal or ethical obligation to call violations to the attention of appropriate enforcement authorities.\n\nCompliance with the Code may be monitored by audits performed by the Board, Audit Committee, the Company’s counsel and/or by the Company’s outside auditors. All Covered Persons are required to cooperate fully with any such audits and to provide truthful and accurate information.\n\nAny waiver of this Code for any Covered Person may be made only by the Board or the Audit Committee and will be promptly disclosed to stockholders and others, as required by applicable law. The Company must disclose changes to and waivers of the Code in accordance with applicable law.\n\n\n\n\nINSIDER TRADING POLICY\n\n**Maris-Tech Ltd.**\n\n**Insider Trading Policy**\n\nEffective May 15, 2023\n\n  1. **Introduction**\n\n\n\nThis policy determines acceptable transactions in the securities of Maris-Tech Ltd. (the “** _Company_** ”) by our officers and other employees, directors and consultants. This policy arises from the Company’s status as a public company whose securities are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, under the symbols “MTEK” and “MTEKW”. During the course of your employment, directorship or consultancy with the Company, you may receive important information that is not yet publicly available (“** _inside information_** ”), about the Company or about other publicly-traded companies with which the Company has business dealings. Because of your access to this inside information, you may be in a position to profit financially by engaging in any transaction involving the Company’s securities, or securities of another publicly-traded company, or to disclose such information to a third party who does so profit or which you may have reasonable belief to assume will use the inside information (a “** _tippee_** ”).\n\n  1. **Insider Trading Policy**\n\n\n  1.  _Securities Transactions_\n\n\n\nUse of inside information by someone for personal gain, or to pass on, or “tip,” the inside information to someone who uses it for personal gain, is illegal, regardless of the quantity of securities, and is therefore prohibited. You can be held liable both for your own transactions and for transactions effected by a tippee, or even a tippee of a tippee. Furthermore, it is important that the appearance of insider trading in securities be avoided. The only exception is that transactions directly with the Company, _e.g.,_ option exercises for cash, or purchases under a Trading Plan (as defined below), are permitted. However, the subsequent sale (including the sale of shares in a cashless exercise program) or other disposition of such shares is fully subject to these restrictions.\n\n  1. _Inside Information_\n\n\n\nAs a practical matter, it is sometimes difficult to determine whether you possess inside information. The key to determining whether nonpublic information you possess about a public company is inside information is whether dissemination of the information would likely affect the market price of the company’s securities or would likely be considered important, or “material”, by investors who are considering trading in that company’s securities. Certainly, if the information makes you want to trade, it would probably have the same effect on others. Remember, both positive and negative information can be material. If you possess inside information, you may not trade in a company’s securities, advise anyone else to do so or communicate the information to anyone else until you know that the information has been publicly disseminated. This means that in some circumstances, you may have to forego a proposed transaction in a company’s securities even if you planned to execute the transaction prior to learning of the inside information and even though you believe you may suffer an economic loss or sacrifice an anticipated profit by waiting. “** _Trading_** ” includes engaging in short sales, transactions in put or call options, hedging transactions and other inherently speculative transactions, for your own account or for others.\n\nAlthough by no means an all-inclusive list, information about the following items may be considered to be inside information until it is publicly disseminated:\n\n  * financial results or forecasts;\n  * confirming or updating previous disclosures or analysts’ reports;\n  * major product or technological developments;\n  * Results of experiments in existing or new technologies or in technologies developed by the company;\n  * major contract awards or cancellations;\n  * M&A activity, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or divisions;\n  * pending public or private sales of debt or equity securities;\n  * declaration of share splits, dividends or changes in dividend policy;\n  * senior management or control changes;\n  * possible tender offers or proxy fights;\n  * significant write-offs;\n  * significant litigation or settlements;\n  * impending bankruptcy;\n  * gain or loss of a significant license agreement or other contracts with customers or suppliers;\n  * pricing changes or discount policies;\n  * cybersecurity risks and incidents;\n  * corporate partner relationships or joint venture developments; and\n  * governmental actions or regulations.\n\n\n\nFor information to be considered publicly disseminated, it must be widely disclosed through a press release or U.S. Securities Exchange Commission filing, and a sufficient amount of time must have passed to allow the information to be fully disclosed. Generally speaking, information will be considered publicly disseminated after two full trading days have elapsed since the date of public disclosure of the information. For example, if an announcement of inside information of which you were aware was made _prior_ to trading on Wednesday, then you may execute a transaction in the Company’s securities on Friday.\n\n  1. **Trading by Directors, Officers, Other Employees, and Consultants of the Company**\n\n\n\nWe require directors, officers, other employees and consultants of the Company to do more than refrain from insider trading. We require that they limit their transactions in the Company’s shares to defined time periods following public dissemination of quarterly (if applicable) interim and annual financial results and notify, and receive approval from, the Chief Financial Officer prior to engaging in transactions in the Company’s securities and observe other restrictions designed to minimize the risk of apparent or actual insider trading.\n\n  1. _Covered Insiders_\n\n\n\nThe provisions outlined in this policy apply to all directors, officers and employees of the Company. Generally, any entities or family members of those individuals whose trading activities are controlled or influenced by any of such persons should be considered to be subject to the same restrictions.\n\n  1. _Window Period_\n\n\n\n**Generally, except as set forth in this paragraph B, in paragraph C and in paragraph D of this policy, directors, officers and other employees may buy or sell securities of the Company only during a “**** _window period_****” that opens after two full trading days have elapsed after the public dissemination of the Company’s annual, interim or quarterly (if applicable) financial results and closes on the last trading day two weeks before the end of the quarter, or six month period (as applicable, and depending on whether the Company reports on a semiannual basis or quarterly basis).** This window period may be closed early or may not open if, in the judgment of the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, there exists undisclosed information that would make trades by the Company’s directors, officers or employees inappropriate. It is important to note that the fact that the window period has closed early or has not opened should be considered inside information. A director, officer or other employee who believes that special circumstances require such person to trade outside the window period should consult with the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. Permission to trade outside the window period will be granted only where the circumstances are extenuating and there appears to be no significant risk that the trade may subsequently be questioned.\n\n  1. _Exceptions to Window Period_\n\n\n  1.  _Option/Warrant Exercises_. Other than as provided in paragraphs III.C.3 and III.C.4 below, directors, officers and other employees may exercise options to purchase shares of the Company granted under the Company’s equity incentive plans in cash without restriction to any particular period in light of information then available to the public.- However, the subsequent sale of the shares (including sales of shares in a cashless exercise) acquired upon the exercise of such options is subject to all provisions of this policy.\n  2. _10b5-1 Automatic Trading Programs_.Rule 10b5-1 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “** _Exchange Act_** ”) provides an affirmative defense from insider trading liability under the U.S. federal securities laws for transactions in the Company’s securities made pursuant to, and in compliance with, a written plan established by a director, officer or other employee that meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 (a “** _Trading_** **_Plan_** ”) that meets each of the following requirements: (a) the Trading Plan is adopted by the insider during a Window Period and when the insider is not in possession of material non-public information; (b) the Trading Plan is followed by the insider; (c) the Trading Plan either (i) specifies the amount of securities to be sold and the date on which the securities are to be sold, (ii) includes a written formula or algorithm, or computer program, for determining the amount of securities to be sold and the price at which and the date on which the securities are to be purchased or sold, or (iii) does not permit the insider to exercise any subsequent influence over how, when, or whether to effect sales; provided, in addition, that any other person who, pursuant to the Trading Plan, does exercise such influence must not have been aware of the material non-public information when doing so; (d) the Trading Plan includes a representation from the insider adopting the Trading Plan that such insider (i) is not aware of any inside information about the Company or its securities and (ii) is adopting the Trading Plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act; (e) the Trading Plan provides that trading under it cannot begin until the later of (i) 90 days after the adoption of the Trading Plan or (ii) two business days following the disclosure of the Company’s financial results in a Report of Foreign Private Issuer on Form 6-K or Annual Report on Form 20-F (such period being referred to as the “cooling-off period”, but, in either case, not to exceed 120 days following the adoption of the Trading Plan, and provided that if the insider is not a director or officer of the Company, such cooling-off period shall be at least 30 days rather than the longer periods set forth above); (f) at the time it is adopted the Trading Plan conforms to all other requirements of Rule 10b5-1 then in effect; (g) the Trading Plan was reviewed by the Company prior to establishment, solely to confirm compliance with this policy and the securities laws; and (h) the Trading Plan allows for the cancellation of a transaction and/or suspension of such Trading Plan upon notice and request by the Company to the individual if any proposed trade (i) fails to comply with applicable laws (_e.g._ , exceeding the number of shares that may be sold under Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“** _Rule 144_** ”)) or (ii) would create material adverse consequences for the Company. The Company must be notified of the establishment of any such Trading Plan, any amendments to such Trading Plan and the termination of such Trading Plan.\n  3. _Former Employees._ Former employees of the Company who have left the Company and still own securities of the Company that have not been forfeited shall contact the Company’s Chief Financial Officer to discuss trading outside the window period on a case-by-case basis. \n\n\n  1.  _Pre-Clearance and Advance Notice of Transactions_\n\n\n\nIn addition to the requirements of paragraph B above, directors, officers and other employees that the Company’s Chief Financial Officer deems to have routine access to material non-public information may not engage in any transaction in the Company’s securities, including any purchase or sale in the open market, loan or other transfer of beneficial ownership without first obtaining pre-clearance of the transaction from the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, at least two trading days in advance of the proposed transaction. The Company’s Chief Financial Officer will then determine whether the transaction may proceed. Pre-cleared transactions not completed within five trading days shall require new pre-clearance under the provisions of this paragraph. The Company may, at its discretion, shorten such period of time.\n\nAdvance notice of gifts or an intent to exercise an outstanding option or warrant to purchase shares shall be given to the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. To the extent possible, advance notice of upcoming transactions to be effected pursuant to an established Trading Plan under Section III.C.2 above shall also be given to the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. \n\n  1.  _Prohibition of Speculative or Short-term Trading_\n\n\n\nNo director, officer or other employee may engage in short sales, transactions in put or call options, hedging transactions, margin accounts or other inherently speculative transactions with respect to the Company’s securities at any time.\n\n  1. _Control Shares_\n\n\n\nDirectors and officers should take care not to violate the restrictions on sales by control persons (Rule 144 under the Securities Act), and should file any notices of sale required by Rule 144.\n\n  1. _Rule 144 and Section 16 Matters for Directors and Officers_\n\n\n\nDirectors and officers of the Company must also comply with Rule 144, or another applicable exemption from registration. The practical effect of Rule 144 is that directors and officers who sell the Company’s securities may be required to comply with a number of requirements including holding period, volume limitation, manner of sale and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing requirements. The Company may provide separate memoranda and other appropriate materials to its directors and officers regarding compliance with Rule 144. In addition, if the Company is no longer considered a “foreign private issuer”, the directors and officers who transact in Company securities have to report such transactions through the filing of Form 4s with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company will advise such persons if they are subject to the requirements of Form 4 and the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.\n\n  1. **Duration of Policy’s Applicability**\n\n\n\nThis policy continues to apply to your transactions in the Company’s securities or the securities of other publicly traded companies engaged in business transactions with the Company even after your employment, directorship or consultancy with the Company has terminated. If you are in possession of inside information when your relationship with the Company concludes, you may not trade in the Company’s securities or the securities of any such other company until the information has been publicly disseminated or is no longer material.\n\n  1. **Penalties**\n\n\n\nAnyone who effects transactions in the Company’s securities or the securities of other public companies engaged in business transactions with the Company (or provides information to enable others to do so) on the basis of inside information is subject to both civil liability and criminal penalties, as well as disciplinary action by the Company. An employee, director or consultant who has questions about this policy should contact his or her own attorney or our Chief Financial Officer, Nir Bussy, at nir@maris-tech.com.\n\n* * *\n\nAdopted/last amended: [•] [•], 2023\n\n[The Maris Edge](https://www.maris-tech.com/the-maris-edge/)\n\n[Markets & Applications](https://www.maris-tech.com/markets-applications/)\n\nOEM Products\n\nAbout\n\n[Events](https://www.maris-tech.com/events/)\n\n[Resources](https://www.maris-tech.com/maris-tech-blog/)\n\nInvestor Relations\n\n[ ![Maris Tech logo](https://www.maris-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/logo.svg) ](https://www.maris-tech.com)\n\n[ ![Elementor logo of Renesas Preferred Partner Program.](https://b3457103.smushcdn.com/3457103/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Renesas_PPP_Badge_blue_pure.png?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1) ](https://www.maris-tech.com/maris-tech-announces-collaboration-with-global-semiconductor-powerhouse-renesas-electronics-corporation-to-advance-edge-computing-solutions-and-acceptance-into-its-preferred-partner-program/press-releases/)\n\nJoin our mailing list\n\nFirst Name \n\nLast Name \n\nEmail \n\nSend\n\n[ Linkedin ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/maris-tech/) [ ](https://twitter.com/MarisTech) [ Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/MarisTech)\n\nCopyright © 2024 Maris Technologies.
