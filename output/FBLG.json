(Nasdaq: FBLG) , a clinical-stage biotechnology company with 160+ patents issued and pending with a focus on the development of therapeutics and potential cures for chronic diseases using fibroblasts and fibroblast-derived materials, announced the filing of a patent application covering methods for treatment of splenomegaly using a cell-based therapeutic approach.\n\nSplenomegaly, or an enlarged spleen, often occurs in connection with immune-related conditions and is seen in a variety of diseases, including autoimmune disorders and chronic infections. Additionally, it can also be caused by multiple rounds of chemotherapy, and depression treatment drugs. The spleen is essential for filtering blood, supporting immune function, and managing red blood cells. However, in cases of immune disorders, it can become overactive, leading to enlargement. Conditions like psoriasis, lupus, HIV, tuberculosis, and blood cancers such as lymphoma and leukemia are common causes of this issue. When the spleen enlarges to handle excess immune cells and inflammation, it can lead to discomfort, anemia, and a weakened immune system, increasing vulnerability to further infections.\n\n“This patent application highlights the potential of fibroblast-based therapies to address immune-related disorders, such as splenomegaly,” said Pete O’Heeron, Founder & Chief Executive Officer of FibroBiologics. “Our technology leverages the unique capabilities of fibroblasts to target immune dysregulation, underscoring their promise in treating complex conditions linked to immune system dysfunction.”\n\n“Filing this patent application marks an important milestone in developing fibroblast-based treatments for immune-driven diseases,” added Hamid Khoja, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of FibroBiologics. “Unlike traditional treatments, fibroblasts may offer a potential solution aligned with the host biological processes to help regulate immune activity within the spleen, opening new possibilities for managing conditions that involve immune system overload and splenomegaly.”\n\nFor more information, please visit [FibroBiologics’ ](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=h-Xsx9__Hf9BgNYF2urkVygwknXU4FgLrdwuH5OhjN6GwrU1izLBNxWmNqPoBlHIvxNg_s6qNdDiJR4jQCTDe73HVKfLbudVm6FUEk8rW_M= \"Opens in a new window\")[website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Dfq3KwjUOP0yDei3uBhPpPyi6THiUuB9lRSq8Bmp1QLGN4klEbnVGkRzHQssBR1M2NWpy3L6xRERHUvvn_cjSQ== \"Opens in a new window\") or email FibroBiologics at: [info@fibrobiologics.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=F4crYM5ZJEHOTYnUl8l_CtAUkYd7iGCJgTwlHVehJun9RJRQLSSTz8fuGpVfuTJy1TgpZEwjJrcUemIZwKf75GFBMT8_9rTZA518pVhhdZA= \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis communication contains \"forward-looking statements\" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy, prospective products, product approvals, research and development costs, future revenue, timing and likelihood of success, plans and objectives of management for future operations, future results of anticipated products and prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\n\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” or “would” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report include, but are not limited to, statements about:\n\n● | the timing, progress and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and future product candidates, including statements regarding the timing of initiation and completion of studies or trials and related preparatory work, the period during which the results of the trials will become available and our research and development programs;  \n---|---  \n● | the timing, scope or likelihood of regulatory submissions, filings, and approvals, including final regulatory approval of our product candidates;  \n● | our ability to develop and advance product candidates into, and successfully complete, clinical trials;  \n● | our expectations regarding the size of the patient populations for our product candidates, if approved for commercial use;  \n● | the implementation of our business model and our strategic plans for our business, product candidates and technology;  \n● | our commercialization, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategy;  \n● | the pricing and reimbursement of our product candidates, if approved;  \n● | the rate and degree of market acceptance and clinical utility of our product candidates, in particular, and cell therapy, in general;  \n● | our ability to establish or maintain collaborations or strategic relationships or obtain additional funding;  \n  \n2   \n---  \n  \n● | our competitive position;  \n---|---  \n● | the scope of protection we and/or our licensors are able to establish and maintain for intellectual property rights covering our product candidates;  \n● | developments and projections relating to our competitors and our industry;  \n● | our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and needs for additional financing;  \n● | the period over which we estimate our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our future operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements; and  \n● | the impact of laws and regulations.  \n  \nWe have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about our business, the industry in which we operate and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or development. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in the section titled “ _Risk Factors_ ” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein until after we distribute this Quarterly Report, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nIn addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and you are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.\n\n3   \n---  \n  \n**PART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1.

Statements**\n\n**September 30, 2024**\n\n**1. Organization, Description of Business, and Liquidity**\n\n**Organization and Business**\n\nFibroBiologics, Inc. (the “Company” or “FibroBiologics”) was originally formed as a limited liability company (“LLC”) under the laws of the State of Texas on April 8, 2021 (“Inception”) and then converted to a Delaware corporation on December 14, 2021. FibroBiologics is a clinical stage biotechnology company headquartered in Houston, Texas, developing innovative treatments for chronic diseases using fibroblast cells. The Company’s primary focus is the initiation and progression of preclinical studies and clinical-stage U.S. Food and Drug Administration trials related to fibroblast treatments for Wound Healing, Multiple Sclerosis, Degenerative Disc Disease, Psoriasis, Cancer, and other diseases. Prior to Inception, preclinical research and development related to these disease pathways took place under the parent company, SpinalCyte, LLC (the “Parent” or “FibroGenesis”).\n\n**Direct Listing**\n\nOn January 31, 2024, the Company completed a direct listing of its common stock on Nasdaq (the “Direct Listing”). Upon completion of the Direct Listing, all outstanding shares of the Company’s Non-voting Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series B-1 Preferred Stock automatically converted into shares of Voting Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, and all outstanding shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock were canceled for no consideration.\n\n**Going Concern and Management’s Plan**\n\nThe Company has incurred operating losses since Inception and expects such losses to continue in the future as it builds infrastructure, develops intellectual property, and conducts research and development activities. The Company has primarily relied on a combination of angel investors and private equity and debt placements to fund its operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $32,419 thousand and cash and cash equivalents of $7,827 thousand. A transition to profitability will depend on the successful development, approval, and commercialization of product candidates and on the achievement of sufficient revenues to support the Company’s cost structure. The Company currently does not generate revenues and may never achieve profitability. Unless and until such time that revenue and net income are generated, the Company will need to continue to raise additional capital. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to raise additional capital. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. As further described in Note 7, management has entered into a Share Purchase Agreement as of November 12, 2021. With the completion of the Company’s Direct Listing, this agreement provides the Company with access to additional liquidity. In February and March 2024, the Company utilized this facility to raise a total of $2,819 thousand, net of costs. In July through September 2024, the Company raised an additional $4,643 thousand, and may utilize this facility to raise additional capital if needed.\n\n**Segments**\n\nOperating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The chief executive officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Company operates and manages its business as a single operating segment and therefore has one reportable segment.\n\n8   \n---  \n  \n**2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**\n\n**Basis of Presentation**\n\nThe accompanying Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024, Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Unaudited Condensed Statements of Stockholders’ Equity/(Deficit) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and Unaudited Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are unaudited. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto. The Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to state fairly the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2024, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the unaudited condensed statements of stockholders’ equity/(deficit) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the unaudited condensed statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The December 31, 2023, Unaudited Condensed Balance Sheet included herein was derived from the audited financial statements, but it does not include all disclosures or notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.\n\nThe financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the unaudited condensed financial statements related to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are unaudited. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for an entire year or for any future period.\n\nDuring the period from January 1, 2021, to its formation on April 8, 2021, the Company operated as a line of business of FibroGenesis rather than as a separate stand-alone entity. Consequently, prior to the Company’s formation on April 8, 2021, the financial statements were derived from the historical accounting records of the Parent. All general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses directly associated with the business activity of the Company that were originally incurred by the Parent from January 1, 2021, through the Company’s formation on April 8, 2021, were allocated and included in the Company’s financial statements. The resulting net Parent investment was presented within stockholders’ equity/(deficit) and represented the Parent’s interest in the recorded net assets of the Company and has been eliminated through the ROFN Agreement as further described in Notes 6 and 10.\n\nIn October 2023, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware to immediately effect a 1-for-4 shares reverse stock split. All share and per share amounts have been adjusted on a retroactive basis to reflect the effect of the reverse stock split.\n\n**Use of Estimates**\n\nThe preparation of the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements; therefore, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\n\n**Concentration of Credit Risk**\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company has significant cash balances at financial institutions, which, throughout the year, regularly exceed the federally insured limit of $250,000. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n9   \n---  \n  \n**Risks and Uncertainties**\n\nThe Company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, changes in any of the following areas that the Company believes could have a material adverse effect on the future financial position or results of operations: the timing of, and the Company’s ability to advance its current and future product candidates into and through clinical development; costs and timelines associated with the manufacture of clinical supplies of the Company’s product candidates; regulatory approval and market acceptance of its product candidates; performance of third-party contract research organizations (“CROs”) and contract development and manufacturing organizations (“CDMOs”); competition from pharmaceutical companies with greater financial resources or expertise; protection of the intellectual property, litigation or claims against the Company based on intellectual property, or other factors; the need to obtain additional funding; and its ability to attract and retain employees necessary to support its growth. Disruption from the operations of CROs, CDMOs or suppliers would likely have a negative impact on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations.\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of unrestricted cash balances and short-term, liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less at the time of purchase. The Company had $6,488 thousand and no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n**Property and Equipment**\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally three to five years, and includes laboratory equipment that is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of five years. Depreciation expense is classified in either research and development expense or in general and administrative expense, depending upon the nature of the asset, in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations. When property and equipment assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheets and the resulting gain or loss is recorded in other income (loss) in the period realized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.\n\nProperty and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company will recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and measure any impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. The Company incurred no such losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**Leases**\n\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. An arrangement is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If a lease is identified, classification is determined at lease commencement. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate and therefore the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the interest rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment over a similar term. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets are based on the corresponding lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before commencement, initial direct costs, and lease incentives. Renewals or early terminations are not accounted for unless the Company is reasonably certain to exercise these options. Operating lease expense is recognized and the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nOperating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use asset, operating lease liability, short-term, and operating lease liability, long-term on the Company’s Unaudited Condensed Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company has elected in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842-20-25-2 an accounting policy to not record short-term leases, defined as those with terms of 12 months or less, on the Unaudited Condensed Balance Sheets. Rent expense recorded under leases, for financial statement purposes, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term based on the most recent contractual terms available.\n\n10   \n---  \n  \n**Fair Value Measurements**\n\nASC 820, _Fair Value Measurement_ , establishes a fair value hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. ASC 820 identifies fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a three-tiered value hierarchy that distinguishes between the following:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted market prices, interest rates and yield curves.\n\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). Level 3 inputs include management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk).\n\nCategorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\n**Derivatives**\n\nDerivative financial instruments, including the liability instrument, are recorded at fair value on the Unaudited Condensed Balance Sheets. Liability classified derivatives are remeasured at their fair value at each reporting date, with decreases or increases in the fair value recognized as other gain or loss, respectively, within the Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations. Equity classified derivatives are not remeasured at each reporting date. If a liability classified derivative becomes eligible for reclassification to an equity classified derivative, any gains or losses recognized up to the point of reclassification are not reversed.\n\n**Research and Development**\n\nResearch and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and bonuses, scientist recruiting costs, employee benefits, facilities costs, laboratory supplies, manufacturing expenses, preclinical expenses, research materials, and consulting and other contracted services. Costs for certain research and development activities are recognized based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements as prepaid or accrued research and development.\n\n**Patent Costs**\n\nAs the Company continues to incur costs to obtain market approval of patented technology, patent costs are expensed as incurred in general, administrative and other expense in the Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations. Costs include fees to renew or extend the term of recognized intangible assets, patent defense costs, and patent application costs. Management will continue to expense such costs until market approval is obtained through regulatory approval by the appropriate governing body.\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nThe Company is a C corporation, and accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\n\n11   \n---  \n  \nUnder the provisions of ASC 740-10, _Income Taxes_ , the Company evaluates uncertain tax positions by reviewing against applicable tax law all positions taken by the Company with respect to tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open. ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of the income tax expense line in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations.\n\n**Stock-Based Compensation**\n\nThe Company recognizes compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees and nonemployees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires management to apply judgment and make estimates, including:\n\n● | _Fair Value of Common Stock_ —For grants made prior to the Direct Listing on January 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of common stock underlying the Company’s stock-based awards has been determined by the board of directors as of each option grant date with input from management, considering the Company’s most recently available third-party valuations of common stock and the board of directors’ assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These third-party valuations were performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (the Practice Aid). For grants made after the Direct Listing, the fair value of common stock underlying stock-based awards is based on the closing price as reported on The Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant.  \n---|---  \n● | _Expected Term_ —The expected term represents the period that a stock-based award is expected to be outstanding. The Company uses the simplified method to determine the expected term, which is based on the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the option.  \n● | _Expected Volatility_ — Due to the Company’s limited operating history and lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, the expected volatility is estimated based on the average historical volatilities of common stock of comparable publicly traded entities over a period of time commensurate with the expected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies are chosen based on their size, stage in the product development cycle, or area of specialty. The Company will continue to apply this process until sufficient historical information regarding the volatility of its own stock price becomes available.  \n● | _Risk-Free Interest Rate_ —The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term of the awards.  \n● | _Expected Dividend_ —The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and has no plans to pay dividends on its common stock. Therefore, the Company used an expected dividend yield of zero.  \n  \n**Emerging Growth Company**\n\nWith the completion of the Direct Listing, the Company is an emerging growth company (“EGC”), as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, an EGC can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies; however, the Company may adopt new or revised accounting standards early if the standard allows for early adoption.\n\n12   \n---  \n  \nIn addition, the Company will utilize other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided to EGCs by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, an EGC is not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on the Company’s system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-EGC public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), or (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items, such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation.\n\n**Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, _Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures_ (“ASU 2023-07”), which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and by extending the disclosure requirements to entities with a single reportable segment. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2023-07 is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of this new guidance may have on the Company’s Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, _Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures_ (“ASU 2023-09”). The guidance in ASU 2023-09 improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-09 may have on its Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements.\n\n**3. Net Income/(Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders**\n\nThe following table summarizes the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of the Company:\n\nSchedule of Basic and Diluted Net Income Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\n\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNumerator:  \nNet loss | $ | (500 | ) | $ | (2,193 | ) | $ | (8,062 | ) | $ | (6,768 | )  \nAdjustment to numerator for earnings per share:  \nDeemed dividend | — | — | — | (2,573 | )  \nNet loss attributable to common stockholders | $ | (500 | ) | $ | (2,193 | ) | $ | (8,062 | ) | $ | (9,341 | )  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted-average number of common shares outstanding, basic and diluted | 33,516,656 | 28,230,842 | 32,457,473 | 28,230,842  \nNet loss per common share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted | $ | (0.01 | ) | $ | (0.08 | ) | $ | (0.25 | ) | $ | (0.33 | )  \n  \nAs further described in Note 6, the Company issued 28,230,842 shares of non-voting common stock on August 18, 2022. Because the issuance of nonvoting common stock shares was treated as a stock split for accounting purposes, these shares are treated as having been issued on January 1, 2022. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, is based upon the non-voting common stock shares issued on August 18, 2022. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is based upon the non-voting common stock shares issued on August 18, 2022, the conversion of all outstanding shares of non-voting common stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock into voting common stock upon completion of the Direct Listing on January 31, 2024, the issuance of 227,057 shares of common stock issued to GEM Global Yield LLC SCS, or GEM, in February through March 2024, and the issuance of 1,198,836 shares of common stock to GEM in July through September 2024.\n\nAs further described in Note 7, the Company issued 741,164 shares of common stock to GEM in September 2024 to facilitate a Draw Down Notice. For accounting purposes, these shares are not considered issued as of September 30, 2024, because no proceeds were received for these shares at issuance and the shares will either be purchased by GEM through a subsequent Closing Notice and payment or returned to the Company, so these shares are contingently returnable.\n\nAs further described in Note 10, the Company agreed to pay to FibroGenesis 15% of the gross proceeds from any equity investments in FibroBiologics prior to an IPO, Direct Listing or Sale of the Company to eliminate upon the occurrence of such event the Series A Preferred Stock and its $35 million liquidation preference. This redemption of preferred stock created a derivative liability that exceeded the net Parent Investment of $1,461 thousand by $1,112 thousand, and is reflected as a reduction of the amount available to common stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share.\n\n13   \n---  \n  \nThe Company had $5,600 thousand of convertible notes outstanding as of December 31, 2022, which could have been converted into common stock in the event that the Company sold and issued shares of capital stock in excess of $10,000 thousand. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, $0 and $5,600 thousand, respectively, of the outstanding convertible notes were converted into shares of Series B Preferred Stock. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported net losses and, accordingly, potential common shares were not included since such inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. No convertible notes were outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company’s basic and diluted net losses per share are the same because it generated a net loss in all periods presented.\n\n**4. Property and Equipment**\n\nProperty and equipment, net consist of the following:\n\nSchedule of Property and Equipment\n\nSeptember 30, | December 31,  \n---|---  \n(in thousands) | 2024 | 2023  \nLaboratory equipment | $ | 882 | $ | 816  \nComputer equipment, software, and other | 47 | 28  \nTotal property and equipment at cost | 929 | 844  \nLess: Accumulated depreciation | (157 | ) | (47 | )  \nProperty and equipment, net | $ | 772 | $ | 797  \n  \nThe useful life of laboratory equipment is five years, and the useful life of computer equipment, software, and other is three years for deprecation. Depreciation expense was $38 thousand and $13 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was $110 thousand and $16 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments**\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company measured its derivative liability related to the conversion option feature in the 2022 Notes at fair value. As of September 30, 2023, $5,600 thousand of the 2022 Notes had been converted, which eliminated $538 thousand of the derivative liability.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company measured its liability instrument to investors under the Share Purchase Agreement, as further described in Note 7, at $7,236 thousand. This liability instrument was comprised of a warrant liability and a forward contract liability, both of which were contingent upon an IPO event, and is classified within Level 3 of the value hierarchy because the liability was based upon a valuation model that used inputs and assumptions including potential outcomes, interest rates, probabilities, and timing. The Company completed its Direct Listing on January 31, 2024, which qualified as an IPO event, and bifurcated the liability instrument into its separate Warrant liability and Forward contract liability components. The fair value of the Warrant liability to be issued upon completion of the Direct Listing on January 31, 2024 was $20,963 thousand, and this fair value decreased to $2,887 thousand at September 30, 2024. The fair value of the Forward contract liability was de minimis at January 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024.\n\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on the three-tier fair value hierarchy:\n\nSchedule of Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\n\n(in thousands) | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nFair Value Measurement as of September 30, 2024  \n(in thousands) | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  \nAssets:  \nCash equivalents | $ | 6,488 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 6,488  \nTotal assets fair value | $ | 6,488 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 6,488  \nLiabilities:  \nForward contract liability | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 241 | $ | 241  \nWarrant liability | — | — | 2,887 | 2,887  \nTotal liabilities fair value | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 3,128 | $ | 3,128  \n(in thousands) | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nFair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2023  \n(in thousands) | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  \nLiabilities:  \nLiability instrument | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 7,236 | $ | 7,236  \nTotal fair value | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 7,236 | $ | 7,236  \nTotal liabilities fair value | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 7,236 | $ | 7,236  \n  \n14   \n---  \n  \nThe following table summarizes the activity related to Level 3 financial liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\n\nSchedule of Transfers In and Out of Level 3 Financial Liabilities\n\n(in thousands) |  **Liability** **Instrument** |  **Forward** **Contract** **Liability** |  **Warrant** **Liability**  \n---|---|---|---  \nFair value at December 31, 2023 | $ | 7,236 | $ | — | $ | —  \nFair value, balance | $ | 7,236 | — | $ | —  \nBifurcation of the liability instrument upon Direct Listing | (7,236 | ) | 7,236  \nIncrease in Warrant liability at issuance January 31, 2024 | — | — | 13,727  \nForward contract liability as of June 30, 2024 | — | 1,500 | —  \nChange in fair value of Forward contract liability | — | (1,259 | ) | —  \nChange in fair value of Warrant liability | — | — | (18,076 | )  \nFair value at September 30, 2024 | $ | — | $ | 241 | $ | 2,887  \nFair value, balance | $ | — | 241 | $ | 2,887  \n  \nAs of December 31, 2023, the liability instrument included the contingent warrant liability and the contingent put option (forward contract) liability as a single unit of account. The liability instrument value was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model and management’s assumption of a 50% likelihood as of December 31, 2023, of becoming a public company prior to the expiration of the Stock Purchase Agreement. Inputs used in the Black-Scholes valuation model included an estimated number of warrants, an assumed common stock share price of $15.00 per share, the five-year time to maturity, a 0% dividend yield, an annual risk-free interest rate of 3.84% for the five-year time to maturity, and an assumed annualized volatility of 96% based on comparable companies with a five-year history of stock prices.\n\nUpon completion of the Direct Listing on January 31, 2024, the warrant liability and the forward contract liability were no longer contingent and were bifurcated out of the liability instrument and treated as separate units of account. As of January 31, 2024, the warrant liability value for the warrant issued to GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (“GYBL”) was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Inputs used in the Black-Scholes valuation model included the 1,299,783 warrants issued to GYBL, the closing bid price of $21.54 per share on January 31, 2024, the five-year time to maturity, a 0% dividend yield, an annual risk-free interest rate of 3.91% for the five-year time to maturity, and an assumed annualized volatility of 97% based on comparable companies with a five-year history of stock prices. As of September 30, 2024, the warrant liability value for the warrant issued to GYBL was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Inputs used in the Black-Scholes valuation model included the 1,299,783 warrants issued to GYBL, the closing bid price of $3.09 per share on September 30, 2024, the four-year time to maturity, a 0% dividend yield, an annual risk-free interest rate of 3.58% for the five-year time to maturity, and an assumed annualized volatility of 100% based on comparable companies with a five-year history of stock prices.\n\nAs further described in Note 7, the Company issued a Draw Down Notice on September 12, 2024, for 1,000,000 shares. On September 26, 2024, an initial Closing Notice was provided by GEM to purchase 258,836 shares and the remainder of the Draw Down Notice remained open. The fair value of the remaining forward contract liability was remeasured at September 30, 2024, based upon the remaining 741,164 shares, a price per share of $3.25, based on the floor price of $3.25 per share because the closing price was lower than the floor price on September 30, 2024, and the 10% discount to be provided to the investor purchasing the shares from the Company.\n\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and Parent company payable and receivable approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities.\n\nThere were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n15   \n---  \n  \n**6. Stockholders’ Equity/(Deficit) / Net Parent Investment**\n\n**Authorized Capital –** As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company authorized 10,000,000 and 20,000,000, respectively, preferred stock shares. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had issued 8,750,000 Series A Preferred Stock shares to FibroGenesis, which were tendered pursuant to the formation of the Company in exchange for the contribution of certain in-process research and development and patent assets through Patent Assignment and Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreements. The Series A Preferred Stock shares had the right to vote and ranked prior to non-voting common stock and common stock with respect to payment of dividends and distributions and upon liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or otherwise. In addition, the Series “A” Preferred Stock had a liquidation preference equal to $35,000 thousand to be allocated among the holders of the Series “A” Preferred Stock shares in the event of a liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Company, which was subsequently eliminated as part of the ROFN Agreement as further described below, and each share of Series “A” Preferred Stock could be converted into one share of common stock at any time at the election of the holder of such shares of Series “A” Preferred Stock. Unless otherwise elected by the holder(s), a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the majority surviving entity or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation would be a deemed liquidation event. The Company has also authorized 62,500,000 shares of non-voting common stock, and has issued during the year ended December 31, 2022, a total of 28,230,842 shares. In August 2022, the Company issued 28,179,592 shares of non-voting common stock to its Parent, which in turn distributed the shares to its members. This issuance of non-voting common stock was accounted for as stock split and no proceeds were received by the Company. The Company also issued to its board of directors, a consultant, and an employee an additional 51,250 total shares in 2022 and recorded $168 thousand of expense for the issuance of these shares, which was based upon a third-party valuation of the shares at the time of issuance.\n\nIn December 2022, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to authorize 2,500,000 shares of Series “B” Preferred Stock. The Series “B” Preferred Stock had a liquidation preference after Series “A” Preferred Stock and prior to Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock. The Series “B” Preferred Stock had voting rights and would automatically convert into Common Stock upon closing of an IPO transaction, as defined in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\n\nIn January 2023, to reflect the ROFN Agreement with its Parent, as further discussed in Note 10, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to a) make the Series “B” Preferred Stock liquidation preference equal to Series “A” Preferred Stock, and b) to provide that upon IPO, Direct Listing, or Sale of the Company, the Series “A” Preferred Stock would be canceled for no consideration.\n\nIn March 2023, the Company accepted a stock subscription to purchase shares of Series B Preferred Stock for $10,000 thousand and recorded a stock subscription payable for the full amount of the $10,000 thousand of proceeds received in March 2023. The stock subscription payable as of March 31, 2023, was subsequently eliminated in April 2023 when the Company issued the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to the shareholder.\n\nIn April 2023, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to authorize 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock, increase the number of authorized Series “B” Preferred Stock shares up to 5,000,000 shares, and to authorize 5,000,000 shares of Series “B-1” Preferred Stock with liquidation preference equal to the Series “A” and “B” Preferred Stock. The Series “B-1” Preferred Stock had voting rights and would automatically convert into Common Stock upon closing of an IPO transaction, as defined in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\n\n16   \n---  \n  \nIn October 2023, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware to increase to 100,000,000 shares its authorized shares of voting common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, reduce to 30,000,000 shares its authorized shares of non-voting common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, and authorize 2,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, par value $0.00001 per share. The Series C Preferred Stock ranked senior to common stock and non-voting common stock and junior to the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock upon liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or otherwise. The Series C Preferred Stock had no voting rights prior to an IPO, and 13,000 votes per share upon closing of an IPO. The Series C Preferred Stock is not entitled to dividends, has a liquidation preference of $18.00 per share, subject to adjustment, may be converted 1:1 at any time at the option of the holder into common stock, and upon closing of an IPO, would, if transferred, automatically convert 1:1 into common stock.\n\nIn January 2024, the Company issued 2,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock to its CEO, who in turn granted a proxy to the Board of Directors to vote these shares as outlined in the amended and restated certification of incorporation.\n\nOn January 31, 2024, the Company completed its Direct Listing, which qualified as an IPO transaction. As a result of the IPO, the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock shares were canceled for no consideration and the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, and non-voting common stock shares were all converted 1:1 into shares of voting common stock. In addition, the Series C Preferred Stock voting rights increased from none to 13,000 votes per share and, if transferred, these shares will automatically convert 1:1 into common stock.\n\nIn August 2024, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware to eliminate its non-voting common stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series B-1 Preferred Stock, and to reduce to 10,000,000 shares its authorized preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of which 2,500 shares are designated as Series C Preferred Stock.\n\n**7. Share Subscription Agreement**\n\nOn November 12, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with certain investors for the sale of up to $100,000 thousand of common stock (the “Aggregate Limit”). This agreement was contingent upon the Company achieving a public listing of its common stock. Major terms of the agreement include a commitment fee of 2% of the Aggregate Limit, which is due no later than one year after public listing even if no drawdowns are taken, and five-year warrants issued to the investors at the time of public listing to purchase common stock equal to 4% of the total equity interests of the Company at the lesser of a) the price per share at the time of the public listing or b) the quotient of $700,000 thousand divided by the total number of equity interests (fully diluted common shares). The Company may request a drawdown, or sale of common stock shares to the investors, over the five-year term of this agreement following the public listing unless terminated earlier. The amount of the drawdowns requested is limited by the trading volumes of the Company’s common stock over the 30-day period preceding the drawdown, and the price per share is equal to 90% of the average price per share over that same period. A 1% fee was due to the investors if the Company were sold in a private sale transaction rather than completing a public listing of its shares.\n\nAfter completion of its public listing on January 31, 2024, and during the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company sold a total of 227,057 shares of common stock for $2,819 thousand of net proceeds through the Share Purchase Agreement.\n\nUpon completion of its public listing the Company recorded a payable of $2,000 thousand for the commitment fee obligation due under the Share Purchase Agreement within one year, and expensed the $1,941 thousand remaining amount of the commitment fee at March 31, 2024.\n\nOn June 27, 2024, the Company issued 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock to facilitate a Draw Down Notice under the Share Purchase Agreement. The Company recorded upon issuance a $1,410 thousand fair value of the forward contract liability for its requirement to sell up to 3,000,000 shares to the investor at 90% of the average closing price per share during the Draw Down Period based upon the number of shares, the closing price per share of $4.66 on June 27, 2024, and the 10% discount to be provided to the investor purchasing the shares from the Company. The fair value of the forward contract liability was remeasured to $638 thousand at July 11, 2024, upon receipt of the Closing Notice from GEM, based upon the 840,000 shares accepted, the $.4.85 closing price per share, and a net purchase price per share of $4.09 after the 10% discount provided to the investor, and the forward contract liability was eliminated. GEM returned 560,000 shares to the Company, which canceled those shares, and the remaining 1,600,000 shares were retained by GEM to facilitate a subsequent Draw Down Notice.\n\nOn July 12, 2024, the Company issued a Draw Down Notice for 1,600,000 shares. The Company recorded upon issuance a $758 thousand fair value of the forward contract liability for its requirement to sell up to 1,600,000 shares to the investor at 90% of the average closing price per share during the Draw Down Period based upon the number of shares, the closing price per share of $4.74 on July 12, 2024, and the 10% discount to be provided to the investor purchasing the shares from the Company. The fair value of the forward contract liability was remeasured to a $286 thousand asset at August 26, 2024, upon receipt of the Closing Notice from GEM, based upon the 100,000 shares accepted, the $1.65 closing price per share, and a net price per share of $4.51 after the 10% discount provided to the investor, and the forward contract liability was eliminated. GEM returned 500,000 shares to the Company, which canceled those shares, and the remaining 1,000,000 shares were retained by GEM to facilitate a subsequent Draw Down Notice.\n\nOn September 12, 2024, the Company issued a Draw Down Notice for 1,000,000 shares. The Company recorded upon issuance a $325 thousand fair value of the forward contract liability for its requirement to sell up to 1,000,000 shares to the investor at 90% of the average closing price per share during the Draw Down Period based upon the number of shares, a price per share of $3.25, based on the floor price of $3.25 per share because the closing price was lower than the floor price on September 12, 2024, and the 10% discount to be provided to the investor purchasing the shares from the Company. Upon receipt of an initial Closing Notice from GEM on September 26, 2024, the fair value of the portion of the forward contract liability covered by the Closing Notice was remeasured to $57 thousand at, based upon the 258,836 shares accepted, the $3.14 price per share, and a net price per share of $2.93 after the 10% discount provided to the investor, and that portion of the forward contract liability was eliminated. The September 12, 2024, Draw Down Notice remained open for 741,164 shares, which will either be sold to GEM pursuant to a future Closing Notice or returned to the Company. The fair value of the of the remaining portion of the forward contract liability was remeasured at September 30, 2024, based on the remaining 741,164 shares, a price per share of $3.25, based on the floor price of $3.25 per share because the closing price was lower than the floor price on September 30, 2024, and the 10% discount to be provided to the investor purchasing the shares from the Company.\n\n**8. Income Taxes**\n\nThe Company did not record any tax provision or benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Management has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of the Company’s net deferred tax assets and has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.\n\n**9. Leases, Commitments and Contingencies**\n\n17   \n---  \n  \nIn October 2022, the Company entered into a lease agreement for office space with a term of 62 months, which expires on November 30, 2027. This lease is accounted for as an operating lease under the ASC 842 guidance for lease accounting. A right-of-use lease asset and lease liability of $2,293 thousand each were recorded at inception of the lease term using a discount rate of 7.5%.\n\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into a new lease for temporary lab and office space for its research operations. This lease has a term of 12 months and monthly rent of $6 thousand and is accounted for as a short-term lease. This lease commenced in August 2023. In September 2023, the Company entered into an amendment of this lease for additional space, and the monthly rent increased to $7 thousand. In March 2024, the Company entered into a second amendment of this lease for additional space, and effective April 1, 2024, the monthly rent increased to $8 thousand. In July 2024, the Company signed an amendment of this lease, effective August 1, 2024, to extend the term for an additional 12 months, and the monthly rent decreased to $7 thousand.\n\nRent expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $466 thousand and $504 thousand, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, noncancelable lease payments under operating leases were $1,629 thousand and noncancelable lease payments under short-term leases were $74 thousand.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, future minimum payments during the remaining period and the next five years are as follows (in thousands):\n\nSchedule of Operating Lease Liabilities Future minimum payments\n\n2024 | $ | 88  \n---|---|---  \n2025 | 488  \n2026 | 544  \n2027 | 509  \n2028 | —  \nThereafter | —  \nTotal lease payments | 1,629  \nLess: Imputed interest | (182 | )  \nTotal lease liabilities | 1,447  \nLess: Current lease liabilities | (392 | )  \nTotal non-current lease liabilities | $ | 1,055  \n  \n**10. Related Party Transactions**\n\nAs described in Note 6, the Company acquired from FibroGenesis certain in-process research and development and patent assets through Patent Assignment and Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreements. The Patent Assignment Agreement transferred the right, title and interest in and to certain patents from FibroGenesis to the Company for further development. The Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreement grants to the Company exclusive rights to patents owned by FibroGenesis in a limited field of use, which includes the diagnosis, treatment, prevention and palliation of a) spinal diseases, disorders, or conditions, b) cancer, c) orthopedics diseases, disorders or conditions, and d) multiple sclerosis.\n\nIn January 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement Regarding Right of First Negotiation (“ROFN Agreement”) with its Parent, FibroGenesis. In exchange for FibroGenesis’ consent to amend the Certificate of Incorporation to a) eliminate upon IPO, Direct Listing, or Sale of the Company the Series A Preferred Stock $35,000 thousand liquidation preference, b) make the Series B Preferred Stock liquidation preference equal to Series “A” Preferred Stock, and c) to provide that upon IPO, Direct Listing, or Sale of the Company Series A Preferred Stock will be cancelled for no consideration, FibroBiologics agreed to pay to FibroGenesis 15% of the gross proceeds from any equity investments in FibroBiologics prior to an IPO, Direct Listing or Sale of the Company. In addition, FibroBiologics received a five-year right of first negotiation if FibroGenesis decides to license externally any of its technology. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to reflect these changes, recorded a derivative liability of $2,573 thousand for the expected future payments to FibroGenesis, and paid $2,645 thousand to FibroGenesis for 15% of the gross proceeds from equity issued by the Company through the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and recorded a loss on derivative liability of $15 thousand. Based on its relationship to Series A Preferred Stock as described above, the derivative liability was recorded first against the net Parent Investment and then to Additional paid-in capital after the net Parent Investment was eliminated. Amounts paid in excess of the derivative liability are recorded as other losses in the Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed its Direct Listing, which resulted in the cancelation of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for no consideration, and paid $141 thousand to FibroGenesis. There was no derivative liability as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There was a payable to FibroGenesis of $0 and $141 thousand, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n18   \n---  \n  \n**11. Share-Based Compensation**\n\nThe Company adopted on August 10, 2022, and the stockholders approved on August 18, 2022, the 2022 Stock Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, and other stock awards. The Plan, through the grant of stock awards, is intended to help the Company secure and retain the services of eligible award recipients, provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and provide a means by which the eligible recipients may benefit from increases in value of the common stock. In September 2022, the Company issued a total of 101,250 options with a strike price of $3.28 per share to employees, directors, and scientific advisory board members under this Plan. In February 2023, the Company issued a total of 3,689,750 options with a strike price of $2.28 per share to employees and directors under this Plan. In August 2023, a total of 2,500 options with a strike price of $3.28 per share were forfeited. In March 2024, the Company issued 216,875 options with a strike price of $13.00 per share to employees under this Plan. In June 2024, the Company issued 6,875 options with a strike price of $6.73 per share to employees under this Plan. In August 2024, the Company issued 25,000 options with a strike price of $1.73 per share to directors under this Plan. Generally, awards granted by the Company vest over four years and have an exercise price equal to the estimated fair value of the common stock as determined by the board of directors with consideration given to contemporaneous valuations of the Company’s common stock prepared by an independent third-party valuation firm for options granted prior to public listing or the closing bid price on the date of grant for options granted after public listing.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were 8,467,889 and 8,711,500 shares, respectively, available for future issuance under the Plan.\n\nStock-based compensation expense is recognized in the Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations as follows:\n\nSchedule of Stock Based Compensation Expense\n\n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n---|---  \n(in thousands of dollars) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nResearch and development | $ | 82 | $ | 66 | $ | 248 | $ | 196  \nGeneral, administrative and other | 490 | 374 | 1,383 | 1,137  \nTotal stock-based compensation expense | $ | 572 | $ | 440 | $ | 1,631 | $ | 1,333  \n  \nIn addition to the $1,631 thousand stock-based compensation expense for stock options, a $45 thousand stock-based compensation expense was recognized for the grant of 2,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock to the CEO during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nUnrecognized stock-based compensation costs related to unvested awards and the weighted-average period over which the costs are expected to be recognized as of September 30, 2024, are as follows:\n\nSchedule of Unvested Awards and Weighted Average Period\n\nStock Options  \n---  \nUnrecognized stock-based compensation expense (in thousands) | $ | 5,766  \nExpected weighted-average period compensation costs to be recognized (years) | 2.6  \n  \nA summary of the Company’s stock option activity is as follows:\n\nSchedule of Stock Option Activity\n\nStock Options |  **Weighted-Average** **Exercise Price per** **Share** |  **Weighted-Average** **Remaining Contractual Life** **(years)** |  **Aggregate** **Intrinsic Value** **(in thousands)**  \n---|---|---|---  \nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 | 3,788,500 | $ | 2.31 | 8.4 | $ | 2,989  \nGranted | 248,750 | $ | 11.69 | 9.5 | $ | 34  \nExercised | — | $ | — | — | $ | —  \nForfeited/Cancelled | (5,139 | ) | $ | 12.74 | 9.4 | $ | —  \nOutstanding as of September 30, 2024 | 4,032,111 | $ | 2.88 | 8.4 | $ | 3,023  \nExercisable as of September 30, 2024 | 1,696,210 | $ | 2.33 | 8.4 | $ | 1,307  \n  \nThe fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors, and consultants was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions:\n\nSchedule of Fair Value of Option Granted Black Scholes\n\nAssumptions: | **Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024** | Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nRisk-free interest rate |  3.7 to 4.3 | % | 3.9 | %  \nExpected volatility |  97 to 101 | % | 90 | %  \nExpected term (years) |  5.5 to 7.0 | 7.0  \nExpected dividend | 0 | % | 0 | %  \n  \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the weighted-average grant date fair value of the options granted was $9.70 per share.\n\n**12. Subsequent Events**\n\nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events through November 12, 2024, the date these unaudited condensed  financial statements  were issued, and determined that there have been no events that have occurred that would require adjustments to the disclosures in these unaudited condensed Financial Statements, other than the following.\n\nOn October 18, 2024, the Company received a Closing Notice from GEM to purchase 15,683 shares at a price of $2.91 per share for proceeds of $46 thousand.\n\n19   \n---  \n  \n**Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations**\n\n_The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and notes thereto included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report and with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023._\n\n**Overview**\n\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing fibroblast-based therapies for patients suffering from chronic diseases with significant unmet medical needs, including wound healing, multiple sclerosis (MS), degenerative disc disease, psoriasis and certain cancers, and potential human longevity applications including thymic involution reversal. At present, our novel manufacturing process entails collecting excess tissue from surgical procedures and using the allogeneic fibroblasts to grow a cell bank for use in our procedures. Our most advanced product candidates are CYWC628, CYMS101 and CybroCell™.\n\nWe are in the late pre-clinical stages of developing CYWC628 as an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy for wound healing. Our studies are presently focused on utilizing fibroblasts and fibroblast-derived cells to treat wounds in diabetic mice. The results of our studies to date have shown statistically significant acceleration in the rate of wound closure in comparison with both a marketed wound care product and control, and improved quality of healed wounds. Based upon our results achieved to date and the expected timing of our remaining preclinical studies, we are planning to initiate a twelve-week Phase 1/2 clinical trial in Australia for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in the second quarter of 2025 as funding allows.\n\nWe are developing CYMS101 as an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy to treat MS. After completing animal studies using CYMS101, we received approval to conduct clinical investigations in Mexico using the fibroblast cell composition for patients with MS and have completed a Phase 1 study. The study was conducted in five participants. The primary objective of the study was to assess safety, and the secondary objective was to assess efficacy. The primary objective was achieved as we saw no adverse events related to the treatment. We are currently conducting further research to determine the mode of action of fibroblasts in oligodendrocyte expansion and expect to file an IND application for a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in MS as funding allows. We will likely seek a strategic partner to collaborate with us on the development of CYMS101 either before initiating the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, or after its completion, if successful, and prior to commencing with a Phase 3 clinical trial.\n\nCybroCell™ is an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy for degenerative disc disease and is being designed as an alternative method for repairing the cartilage of the intervertebral disc (or any other articular cartilage). We have completed two animal studies. The results from the studies were positive and resulted in “first in human” trial approval. We have received IND clearance from the FDA, conditional upon approval of our master cell bank, to run a Phase 1 study for patients suffering from degenerative disc disease and will be conducting this study within the United States. A timeline will be determined through discussions with the FDA and as funding allows.\n\nCYPS317 is our allogeneic intravenously administered fibroblast cell-based therapeutic for the treatment of psoriasis. We are moving this early phase project to our product candidate pipeline. Our early pre-clinical animal model studies have demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of mild and severe psoriasis. Our studies have also demonstrated improved efficacy as compared to anti IL-23 monoclonal antibody, with no adverse effects noted with the respiratory, circulatory, hepatic and renal organ systems. We are currently in the process of continuing our IND-enabling animal model studies, with a projected completion timeline of the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nWe also have human longevity, cancer, and artificial pancreatic organoid programs in the early stages of development, and we plan to accelerate such programs as funding allows.\n\nWe currently utilize a CDMO to manufacture our cell therapy product candidates. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we will evaluate the longer-term feasibility of building our own cGMP manufacturing facility or continuing to outsource production to a CDMO for clinical testing and commercial sales.\n\nSince our spinoff from FibroGenesis in April 2021, our operations have included business planning, hiring personnel, raising capital, building our intellectual property portfolio, and performing research and development on our product candidates and our fibroblast technology, leveraging the clinical benefits of fibroblasts as the basis of our cell therapy platform.\n\nWe have incurred net losses since Inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through investment from FibroGenesis, the issuance of $5.6 million of our convertible promissory notes from December 2021 through April 2022, the issuance of $18.6 million of preferred stock, and the issuance of $8.0 million of common stock.\n\n20   \n---  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $7.8 million. Since our Inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We incurred net losses of approximately $8.1 million and $6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $32.4 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the next several years. See “— _Funding Requirements_ ” below.\n\nWe expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase substantially if and as we:\n\n● | advance the development of our lead product candidates through clinical development, and, if approved by the FDA, commercialization;  \n---|---  \n● | advance our preclinical development programs into clinical development;  \n● | incur manufacturing costs for cell production to supply our product candidates;  \n● | seek regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;  \n● | increase our research and development activities to identify and develop new product candidates;  \n● | hire additional personnel;  \n● | expand our operational, financial and management systems;  \n● | meet the requirements and demands of being a public company;  \n● | invest in further development to protect and expand our intellectual property;  \n● | establish a sales, marketing, medical affairs, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval and intend to commercialize; and  \n● | expand our manufacturing and develop our commercialization efforts.  \n  \nDue to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biopharmaceutical product development and the economic and developmental uncertainty, we may be unable to accurately predict the timing or magnitude of all expenses. Our ability to ultimately generate revenue to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the development, approval, and subsequent commercialization of our product candidates. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\n\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our long-term continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, which may include collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may not be able to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we will have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions.\n\n**General Trends and Outlook**\n\n**_Recent Developments_**\n\n_CYWC628_\n\nWe completed pre-clinical studies investigating (i) multiple administrations of CYWC628 on a chemically induced chronic wound NONcNZO10/LtJ mouse model, (ii) dose titration to provide information on the effective dose range of CYWC628, and (iii) acute and chronic toxicity. We expect to complete our remaining pre-clinical studies by the end of 2024.\n\nAs part of the preparation for a Phase I/II clinical trial of CYWC628 for the potential treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), we entered into a master service agreement with a CDMO that will govern the production of our master cell bank, working cell bank, and our CYWC628 drug product candidate. We also entered into a master service agreement with a CRO that will carry out the Phase I/II clinical trial of CYWC628 for the potential treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in Australia in 2025.\n\n_Psoriasis_\n\nWe have completed an early phase project utilizing a psoriasis mouse model to assess the potential use of intravenous administration of fibroblast spheroids for the treatment of psoriasis. Results to date include that a single administration of fibroblast spheroids resulted in significant improvement in mice with moderate psoriasis, and that multiple administrations of fibroblast spheroids resulted in significant improvement in mice with severe psoriasis. We also compared fibroblast spheroid with single and multiple administration of an anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody in treatment of mice with mild to moderate psoriasis. We noted that a single treatment of fibroblast spheroids was significantly better than single and multiple administration of an anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody. We are in the process of carrying out a dosage titration animal model study to determine optimal efficacious dose range, in addition to determining the durability of treatment for mild to moderate, and moderate to severe psoriasis. Three anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody treatments are approved by the FDA for the treatment of psoriasis, including Tremfya®, Illumya®, and Skyrizi®. As a result of these studies, we have moved this project to our product candidate pipeline with the name of CYPS317.\n\n_Intellectual Property_\n\nWe have filed two new patent applications with the United States Patent Office. The first patent application covers the use of fibroblast cell-based technology in an adhesive bandage for wound healing. The second patent application covers the use of fibroblast cell-based technology in generating three-dimensional hemopoietic organoids that can give rise to functional immune cells.\n\n21   \n---  \n  \n**Components of Results of Operations**\n\n**_Revenue_**\n\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for any of our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. We cannot predict if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\n\n**_Research and Development Expenses_**\n\nOur research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates and include:\n\n● | employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation for our research and development personnel;  \n---|---  \n● | laboratory equipment and supplies;  \n● | direct third-party costs such as expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and CDMOs;  \n● | consultants that conduct research and development activities on our behalf;  \n● | costs associated with conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;  \n● | costs associated with technology; and  \n● | facilities and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and other facility related costs and other supplies.  \n  \nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\n\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing our product candidates as they advance into later stages of clinical development and our other product candidates in preclinical development as they advance into clinical development. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including uncertainty related to:\n\n● | the duration, costs and timing of clinical trials for our current development programs and any further clinical trials related to new product candidates;  \n---|---  \n● | the sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials;  \n● | the acceptance of IND applications for future clinical trials;  \n● | the successful and timely enrollment and completion of clinical trials;  \n● | the successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials;  \n● | successful data from our clinical program that supports an acceptable risk-benefit profile of our product candidates in the intended populations;  \n● | the receipt and maintenance of regulatory and marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;  \n● | establishing agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if any of our product candidates are approved;  \n● | the entry into collaborations to further the development of our product candidates;  \n● | obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; and  \n● | successfully launching our product candidates and achieving commercial sales, if and when approved.  \n  \n22   \n---  \n  \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our programs or any product candidate we develop would significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development and/or regulatory approval of such programs or product candidates.\n\n**_General, Administrative and Other Expenses_**\n\nOur general, administrative, and other expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, allocated facilities costs, and other expenses for outside professional services, including legal, marketing, investor relations, human resources services, and accounting services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our general and administrative personnel. We will continue to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, Nasdaq, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. We also expect to increase the size of our administrative function to support the growth of our business.\n\n**_Interest Expense_**\n\nOur interest expense consists primarily of accrued interest expense and amortization of discount on our convertible notes.\n\n**Statements of Operations**\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n**_Comparison of Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023_**\n\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,** | Change Amount  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023  \n(unaudited, in thousands)  \nOperating expenses**:**  \nResearch and development | $ | 1,213 | $ | 571 | $ | 642  \nGeneral, administrative and other | 2,139 | 1,481 | 659  \nTotal operating expenses | 3,352 | 2,052 | 1,300  \nLoss from operations | (3,352 | ) | (2,052 | ) | (1,300 | )  \nChange in fair value of liability instrument and warrant liability | 1,927 | — | 1,927  \nChange in fair value of forward contract liability | 849 | — | 1,090  \nOther income/(loss) | 2 | (141 | ) | 143  \nInterest income | 79 | — | 79  \nInterest expense | (5 | ) | — | (5 | )  \nNet loss | $ | (500 | ) | $ | (2,193 | ) | $ | 1,934  \n**Nine Months Ended** **September 30,** | Change Amount  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023  \n(unaudited, in thousands)  \nOperating expenses**:**  \nResearch and development | $ | 3,148 | $ | 1,595 | $ | 1,553  \nGeneral, administrative and other | 6,877 | 4,814 | 2,063  \nTotal operating expenses | 10,025 | 6,409 | 3,616  \nLoss from operations | (10,025 | ) | (6,409 | ) | (3,616 | )  \nChange in fair value of liability instrument and warrant liability | 4,349 | — | 4,349  \nChange in fair value of future contract liability | (651 | ) | — | (410 | )  \nCommitment fee expense | (1,941 | ) | — | (1,941 | )  \nOther income/(loss) | 32 | (213 | ) | 245  \nInterest income | 188 | — | 188  \nInterest expense | (14 | ) | (146 | ) | 132  \nNet loss | $ | (8,062 | ) | $ | (6,768 | ) | $ | (1,053 | )  \n  \n23   \n---  \n  \n**_Research and Development Expenses_**\n\nResearch and development expenses were $1.2 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $0.6 million was primarily due to:\n\n● | increased tissue acquisition and CDMO costs of $0.3 million for cell manufacturing activities;  \n---|---  \n● | increased personnel related expenses of $0.2 million due to hiring additional research scientists after September 30, 2023; and   \n● | increased research materials and supplies expenses of $0.1 million due to increased laboratory personnel and preclinical studies.  \n  \nResearch and development expenses were $3.1 million and $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $1.5 million was primarily due to:\n\n● | increased personnel related expenses of $0.6 million due to hiring additional research scientists after September 30, 2023;  \n---|---  \n● | increased tissue acquisition and CDMO costs of $0.5 million for cell manufacturing activities; and   \n● | increased research materials and supplies, conferences, and depreciation expenses of $0.4 million due to increased laboratory personnel and preclinical studies.  \n  \nResearch and development expenses are not tracked by product candidate.\n\n**_General, Administrative and Other Expenses_**\n\nGeneral, administrative and other expenses were $2.1 million and $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $0.6 million was primarily due to:\n\n● | increased expense of $0.2 million for public company D&O insurance;  \n---|---  \n● | increased expenses of $0.2 million for patent filing and maintenance costs;  \n● | increased expenses of $0.2 million for added personnel in 2024;  \n● | increased expenses of $0.1 million for investor relations and marketing costs, and.  \n● | decreased expenses of $0.1 million for legal fees.  \n  \nGeneral, administrative and other expenses were $6.9 million and $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $2.1 million was primarily due to:\n\n● | increased expenses of $0.7 million for regulatory, listing, accounting, investor relations and marketing expenses related to our Direct Listing completed in January 2024 and subsequent financing efforts;  \n---|---  \n● | increased expenses of $0.7 million for added personnel in 2024;  \n● | increased expenses of $0.5 million for patent filing and maintenance costs;  \n● | increased expense of $0.5 million for public company D&O insurance;  \n● | decreased expenses of $0.3 million due to timing of an executive bonus in January 2023.  \n  \n**_Change in fair value of warrant liability_**\n\nChange in fair value of warrant liability was a gain of $1.9 million and none for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The liability instrument to investors under the Share Purchase Agreement among us, GEM Global Yield LLC SCS, or GEM, and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited, or GYBL, dated November 12, 2021, or the GEM SPA, was comprised of the contingent warrant liability and contingent put option. The $1.9 million gain during the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from the mark to market of the warrant liability, which will occur at the end of each reporting period as long as the warrants are outstanding and classified as a liability.\n\nChange in fair value of warrant liability was a gain of $4.3 million and none for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This change in fair value resulted primarily from the decrease in our stock price.\n\n**_Change in fair value of forward contract liability_**\n\nChange in fair value of forward contract liability was a net gain of $0.8 million and $0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A forward contract liability to sell shares to the investor at 90% of the average daily closing price per share over the Draw Down Pricing Period is recorded each time we issue a Draw Down Notice to GEM under the Share Purchase Agreement. The forward contract liability is remeasured at the end of each quarter, if open, and again upon receipt of the Closing Notice from the investor. The forward contract liability is eliminated upon receipt of the Closing Notice and funds from the investor.\n\nChange in fair value of forward contract liability was a net loss of $0.7 million and $0.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**_Commitment fee expense_**\n\nCommitment fee expense was $1.9 million and none for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A $2 million commitment fee pursuant to the GEM SPA became payable to GEM upon completion of the Direct Listing in January 2024. The commitment fee is payable to GEM as drawdown notices are issued, with any remaining balance payable one year after public listing. We sold $3.0 million of common stock to GEM under the GEM SPA during the three months ended March 31, 2024, which made approximately $0.1 million of the commitment fee payable immediately. This $0.1 million portion of the commitment fee was netted against the proceeds received in additional paid-in capital. The remaining $1.9 million was expensed immediately because we were planning to raise funds through other sources and had no plans to issue further Draw Down Notices to GEM prior to the one-year anniversary of our public listing when this remaining amount will be due.\n\n**_Other loss_**\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of other loss is comprised of the payments to FibroGenesis in excess of the derivative liability established at inception of the Agreement Regarding Right of First Negotiation entered into by us and FibroGenesis in January 2023, or the ROFN Agreement.\n\n**_Interest income_**\n\nInterest income is comprised of interest income and unrealized gain/losses on cash equivalents.\n\n24   \n---  \n  \n**_Interest Expense_**\n\nInterest expense was $0.0 million and $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of $0.1 million was due to the maturities and conversions of the notes during the year ended December 31, 2023. Interest expense was recorded in 2023 for the nominal interest rate of 6.0% plus the amortization of the discount on the 2022 convertible notes.\n\n**_Income Taxes_**\n\nThe effective income tax rate was 0.0% for all periods. Currently, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n**_Overview_**\n\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily with investment from FibroGenesis, proceeds from borrowings under our convertible loan agreements, and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and common stock. From Inception through September 30, 2024, we have received gross proceeds of approximately $5.6 million from sales of our convertible notes, $18.6 million from the issuance of preferred stock, and $8.0 million from the issuance of common stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $7.8 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $32.3 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding debt.\n\n**_Cash Flows_**\n\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nNet cash used in operating activities | $ | (8,828 | ) | $ | (4,800 | )  \nNet cash used in investing activities | (85 | ) | (493 | )  \nNet cash provided by financing activities | 7,577 | 13,793  \nNet increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents | $ | (1,336 | ) | $ | 8,500  \n  \n**_Cash Flows from Operating Activities_**\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was $8.8 million and $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and consisted primarily of net losses of $8.1 million and $6.8 million, respectively. Noncash losses on stock-based compensation expense of $1.7 million and change in fair value of forward contract liability of $0.7 million, and amortization of operating lease right-of-use asset of $0.3 million, and change in commitment fee payable of $1.9 million partially offset the net loss, while noncash gain on change in fair value of liability instrument of $4.3 million, an increase in prepaid expenses of $0.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.3 million, a decrease in payable to Parent of $0.1 million, and a decrease in operating lease liability of $0.3 million added to the cash used in operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Noncash expenses of stock-based compensation of $1.3 million, other loss on derivative liability of $0.1 million, amortization of convertible notes debt discount of $0.1 million, and amortization of operating lease right-of-use asset of $0.3 million, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.4 million and an increase in payable to Parent of $0.1 million partially offset the net loss, while a decrease in operating lease liability of $0.3 million added to the cash used in operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**_Cash Flows from Investing Activities_**\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $0.1 million and $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and consist primarily of laboratory equipment purchases.\n\n25   \n---  \n  \n**_Cash Flows from Financing Activities_**\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $7.6 million and $13.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into a $0.6 million short-term borrowing agreement to finance the D&O insurance policy premiums and repaid $0.5 million of the principal borrowed, and we raised $7.5 million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock under the GEM SPA. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid to FibroGenesis $2.6 million under the ROFN Agreement, we received $0.3 million from FibroGenesis’ repayment of its note payable to us, and we received $15.2 million in total net proceeds from the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock.\n\n**_Funding Requirements_**\n\nWe do not have any products approved for sale, and we have never generated any revenue from contracts with customers. We do not expect to generate any meaningful revenue unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our current or future product candidates and we do not know when, or if, that will occur. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our current and future product candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. We are subject to all the risks typically related to the development of new product candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. Moreover, we will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared as though we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since Inception. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $32.4 million. Management expects to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows.\n\nThese factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to raise additional capital. We will need to raise additional capital to continue to fund our operations. We believe we will be able to obtain additional capital through equity financings or other arrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that such additional financing, if available, can be obtained on acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued.\n\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\n● | the initiation, progress, timeline, cost and results of our clinical trials for our product candidates;  \n---|---  \n● | the initiation, progress, timeline, cost and results of additional research and preclinical studies related to pipeline development and other research programs we initiate in the future;  \n● | the cost and timing of manufacturing activities, including our planned manufacturing scale-up activities associated with our product candidates and other programs as we advance them through preclinical and clinical development through commercialization;  \n● | the potential expansion of our current development programs to seek new indications;  \n● | the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;  \n● | the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, in-licensed or otherwise;  \n  \n26   \n---  \n  \n● | the effect of competing technological and market developments;  \n---|---  \n● | the payment of licensing fees, potential royalty payments and potential milestone payments;  \n● | the cost of general operating expenses;  \n● | the cost of establishing sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval in regions where we choose to commercialize our products on our own; and  \n● | the costs of operating as a public company.  \n  \nFurther, our operating plan may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials and other research and development expenditures.\n\nIf we need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our preclinical studies, clinical trials, research and development programs or commercialization efforts. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, and other licensing arrangements. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\n\n**Contractual Obligations and Commitments**\n\nMaterial contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of operating leases. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable leases as of September 30, 2024, were approximately $1.6 million, of which $0.5 million is due within one year. We generally expect to satisfy these commitments with cash on hand and cash provided by financing activities.\n\n**Critical Accounting Estimates**\n\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nWe define our critical accounting estimates as those under GAAP that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please see the disclosures in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a Forward contract liability with each Draw Down Notice issued to GEM and have remeasured this Forward contract liability at each quarter end and upon receipt of each Closing Notice from GEM. Other than the Forward contract liability critical accounting estimates and changes in the fair value of the Warrant liability, as described in this Quarterly Report, there have not been any material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2023.\n\n**Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**\n\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and are not required to provide the information specified under this item.\n\n27   \n---  \n  \n**Item 4. Controls and Procedures**\n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a–15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\n\n**_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_**\n\nWe have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision, and with the participation, of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10–Q. During the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to a lack of segregation of duties. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\nSpecifically, our management identified a material weakness in our internal controls within the financial reporting function that resulted from an ineffective design and implementation of controls over proper segregation of duties for the period of time covered by our financial statements due to a limited number of individuals. Based upon such evaluation, and due to the material weakness identified, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.\n\n**_Remediation Plan for Material Weakness_**\n\nWe will continue to add staff, evaluate segregation of duties, and implement initiatives to improve our internal controls over financial reporting as we grow.\n\n**_Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_**\n\nThere has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n**_Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls_**\n\nA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within an organization have been detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. We continue to implement, improve, and refine our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n28   \n---  \n  \n**PART II — OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1. Legal Proceedings**\n\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings relating to intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are subject to uncertainty and there can be no assurance that such legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We are not party to any legal proceedings at this time.\n\n**Item 1A. Risk Factors**\n\nOur business is subject to risks, uncertainties, and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024.\n\n**Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements**\n\n**_There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern._**\n\nIn connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report, our management concluded that there is substantial doubt as to whether we can continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of this Quarterly Report. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising capital to maintain current operations and continue research and development efforts. We plan to raise additional capital to fund our operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, and/or potential collaborations and license arrangements or other sources. There is no assurance, however, that any additional financing or any revenue-generating collaboration will be available when needed or that we will be able to obtain financing or enter into a collaboration on terms acceptable to us.\n\nThese factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may materially and adversely affect the price per share of our common stock, and it may be more difficult for us to obtain financing. If existing or potential collaborators decline to do business with us or potential investors decline to participate in any future financings due to such concerns, our ability to increase our cash position may be limited. The perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations. We have prepared our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we will be forced to delay, reduce or discontinue our research and development programs or consider other various strategic alternatives and you could lose all or part of your investment in us.\n\n**Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds**\n\nThe following sets forth information regarding all unregistered securities we sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Unless stated otherwise, the sales of the securities listed below were deemed to be exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, including Regulation D and Rule 506 promulgated thereunder, as transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering.\n\nOn June 27, 2024, the Company issued 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock to facilitate a Draw Down Notice under the Share Purchase Agreement. The investor subsequently accepted the Draw Down Notice for 840,000 shares and sent a Closing Notice dated July 11, 2024, for the 840,000 shares issued at a net price of $4.09 per share after applying the 10% discount and remitted $3,436 thousand gross proceeds to the Company.

All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position,\nbusiness strategy, prospective products, product approvals, research and development costs, future revenue, timing and likelihood of success, plans and objectives of management for future\noperations, future results of anticipated products and prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks,\nuncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements\nexpressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\nIn some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,”\n“potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” or “would” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these\nwords. Forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report include, but are not limited to, statements about:\n● the timing, progress and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and future product candidates, including statements regarding the timing of initiation and\ncompletion of studies or trials and related preparatory work, the period during which the results of the trials will become available and our research and development programs;\n● the timing, scope or likelihood of regulatory submissions, filings, and approvals, including final regulatory approval of our product candidates;\n● our ability to develop and advance product candidates into, and successfully complete, clinical trials;\n● our expectations regarding the size of the patient populations for our product candidates, if approved for commercial use;\n● the implementation of our business model and our strategic plans for our business, product candidates and technology;\n● our commercialization, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategy;\n● the pricing and reimbursement of our product candidates, if approved;\n● the rate and degree of market acceptance and clinical utility of our product candidates, in particular, and cell therapy, in general;\n● our ability to establish or maintain collaborations or strategic relationships or obtain additional funding;\n2\n● our competitive position;\n● the scope of protection we and/or our licensors are able to establish and maintain for intellectual property rights covering our product candidates;\n● developments and projections relating to our competitors and our industry;\n● our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and needs for additional financing;\n● the period over which we estimate our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our future operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements; and\n● the impact of laws and regulations.\nWe have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about our business, the industry in which we operate and financial trends that we believe\nmay affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or development. These forward-\nlooking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and\nelsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely\non these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results\ncould differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements\ncontained herein until after we distribute this Quarterly Report, whether as a result of any new information, future events or otherwise.\nIn addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the\ndate of this Quarterly Report, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should\nnot be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and you are\ncautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.\n3\nPART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

Inc.\nNotes to the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2024\n1. Organization, Description of Business, and Liquidity\nOrganization and Business\nFibroBiologics, Inc. (the “Company” or “FibroBiologics”) was originally formed as a limited liability company (“LLC”) under the laws of the State of Texas on April 8, 2021 (“Inception”)\nand then converted to a Delaware corporation on December 14, 2021. FibroBiologics is a clinical stage biotechnology company headquartered in Houston, Texas, developing innovative\ntreatments for chronic diseases using fibroblast cells. The Company’s primary focus is the initiation and progression of preclinical studies and clinical-stage U.S. Food and Drug Administration\ntrials related to fibroblast treatments for Wound Healing, Multiple Sclerosis, Degenerative Disc Disease, Psoriasis, Cancer, and other diseases. Prior to Inception, preclinical research and\ndevelopment related to these disease pathways took place under the parent company, SpinalCyte, LLC (the “Parent” or “FibroGenesis”).\nDirect Listing\nOn January 31, 2024, the Company completed a direct listing of its common stock on Nasdaq (the “Direct Listing”). Upon completion of the Direct Listing, all outstanding shares of the\nCompany’s Non-voting Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series B-1 Preferred Stock automatically converted into shares of Voting Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, and all\noutstanding shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock were canceled for no consideration.\nGoing Concern and Management’s Plan\nThe Company has incurred operating losses since Inception and expects such losses to continue in the future as it builds infrastructure, develops intellectual property, and conducts research\nand development activities. The Company has primarily relied on a combination of angel investors and private equity and debt placements to fund its operations. As of September 30, 2024, the\nCompany had an accumulated deficit of $32,419 thousand and cash and cash equivalents of $7,827 thousand. A transition to profitability will depend on the successful development, approval,\nand commercialization of product candidates and on the achievement of sufficient revenues to support the Company’s cost structure. The Company currently does not generate revenues and\nmay never achieve profitability. Unless and until such time that revenue and net income are generated, the Company will need to continue to raise additional capital. These factors raise\nsubstantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements. The ability of the Company to continue as a going\nconcern is dependent on the Company’s ability to raise additional capital. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue\nas a going concern. As further described in Note 7, management has entered into a Share Purchase Agreement as of November 12, 2021. With the completion of the Company’s Direct Listing,\nthis agreement provides the Company with access to additional liquidity. In February and March 2024, the Company utilized this facility to raise a total of $2,819 thousand, net of costs. In July\nthrough September 2024, the Company raised an additional $4,643 thousand, and may utilize this facility to raise additional capital if needed.\nSegments\nOperating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in\nmaking decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The chief executive officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, reviews financial information on an aggregate\nbasis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Company operates and manages its business as a single operating segment and therefore has one reportable\nsegment.\n8\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)\nfor interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”). The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024, Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, Unaudited Condensed Statements of Stockholders’ Equity/(Deficit) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and Unaudited\nCondensed Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, are unaudited. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by\nGAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto. The Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements\nhave been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments)\nnecessary to state fairly the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2024, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the unaudited\ncondensed statements of stockholders’ equity/(deficit) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the unaudited condensed statements of cash flows for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The December 31, 2023, Unaudited Condensed Balance Sheet included herein was derived from the audited financial statements, but it does not\ninclude all disclosures or notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.\nThe financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the unaudited condensed financial statements related to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nare unaudited. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for an entire year or for any future period.\nDuring the period from January 1, 2021, to its formation on April 8, 2021, the Company operated as a line of business of FibroGenesis rather than as a separate stand-alone entity.\nConsequently, prior to the Company’s formation on April 8, 2021, the financial statements were derived from the historical accounting records of the Parent. All general and administrative\nexpenses and research and development expenses directly associated with the business activity of the Company that were originally incurred by the Parent from January 1, 2021, through the\nCompany’s formation on April 8, 2021, were allocated and included in the Company’s financial statements. The resulting net Parent investment was presented within stockholders’\nequity/(deficit) and represented the Parent’s interest in the recorded net assets of the Company and has been eliminated through the ROFN Agreement as further described in Notes 6 and 10.\nIn October 2023, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware to immediately effect a 1-for-4 shares reverse stock split. All share and per\nshare amounts have been adjusted on a retroactive basis to reflect the effect of the reverse stock split.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting\nperiods. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements; therefore, actual results could differ from those estimates and\nassumptions.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company has significant cash balances at\nfinancial institutions, which, throughout the year, regularly exceed the federally insured limit of $250,000. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse\nimpact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n9\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe Company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, changes in any of the following areas that the Company believes could have a material adverse\neffect on the future financial position or results of operations: the timing of, and the Company’s ability to advance its current and future product candidates into and through clinical\ndevelopment; costs and timelines associated with the manufacture of clinical supplies of the Company’s product candidates; regulatory approval and market acceptance of its product\ncandidates; performance of third-party contract research organizations (“CROs”) and contract development and manufacturing organizations (“CDMOs”); competition from pharmaceutical\ncompanies with greater financial resources or expertise; protection of the intellectual property, litigation or claims against the Company based on intellectual property, or other factors; the need\nto obtain additional funding; and its ability to attract and retain employees necessary to support its growth. Disruption from the operations of CROs, CDMOs or suppliers would likely have a\nnegative impact on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of unrestricted cash balances and short-term, liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less at the time of purchase. The\nCompany had $6,488 thousand and no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful\nlives of the respective assets, generally three to five years, and includes laboratory equipment that is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful\nlives of five years. Depreciation expense is classified in either research and development expense or in general and administrative expense, depending upon the nature of the asset, in the\naccompanying Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations. When property and equipment assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are\nremoved from the balance sheets and the resulting gain or loss is recorded in other income (loss) in the period realized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.\nProperty and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that\nwould necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or a\nsignificant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company will recognize\nan impairment loss only if the carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and measure any impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount\nand estimated fair value. The Company incurred no such losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. An arrangement is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time\nin exchange for consideration. If a lease is identified, classification is determined at lease commencement. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease\npayments at the lease commencement date. The Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate and therefore the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease\npayments. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the interest rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar\neconomic environment over a similar term. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets are based on the corresponding lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before\ncommencement, initial direct costs, and lease incentives. Renewals or early terminations are not accounted for unless the Company is reasonably certain to exercise these options. Operating\nlease expense is recognized and the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use asset, operating lease liability, short-term, and operating lease liability, long-term on the Company’s Unaudited Condensed\nBalance Sheets.\nThe Company has elected in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842-20-25-2 an accounting policy to not record short-term leases, defined as those with terms of\n12 months or less, on the Unaudited Condensed Balance Sheets. Rent expense recorded under leases, for financial statement purposes, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term\nbased on the most recent contractual terms available.\n10\nFair Value Measurements\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a fair value hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable\ninputs) and the Company’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data\nobtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the\nassets or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. ASC 820 identifies fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC\n820 establishes a three-tiered value hierarchy that distinguishes between the following:\nLevel 1 - Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted market prices, interest rates and yield curves.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). Level 3 inputs include management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk).\nCategorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nDerivatives\nDerivative financial instruments, including the liability instrument, are recorded at fair value on the Unaudited Condensed Balance Sheets. Liability classified derivatives are remeasured at\ntheir fair value at each reporting date, with decreases or increases in the fair value recognized as other gain or loss, respectively, within the Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations.\nEquity classified derivatives are not remeasured at each reporting date. If a liability classified derivative becomes eligible for reclassification to an equity classified derivative, any gains or\nlosses recognized up to the point of reclassification are not reversed.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including\nsalaries and bonuses, scientist recruiting costs, employee benefits, facilities costs, laboratory supplies, manufacturing expenses, preclinical expenses, research materials, and consulting and\nother contracted services. Costs for certain research and development activities are recognized based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs\nincurred, and are reflected in the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements as prepaid or accrued research and development.\nPatent Costs\nAs the Company continues to incur costs to obtain market approval of patented technology, patent costs are expensed as incurred in general, administrative and other expense in the\nUnaudited Condensed Statements of Operations. Costs include fees to renew or extend the term of recognized intangible assets, patent defense costs, and patent application costs. Management\nwill continue to expense such costs until market approval is obtained through regulatory approval by the appropriate governing body.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is a C corporation, and accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the\ndifference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation\nallowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\n11\nUnder the provisions of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, the Company evaluates uncertain tax positions by reviewing against applicable tax law all positions taken by the Company with respect\nto tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open. ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the\nposition will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties\nrelated to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of the income tax expense line in the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees and nonemployees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant and\nrecognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. The fair value of stock\noptions is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires management to apply judgment and make estimates, including:\n● Fair Value of Common Stock—For grants made prior to the Direct Listing on January 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of common stock underlying the Company’s stock-based\nawards has been determined by the board of directors as of each option grant date with input from management, considering the Company’s most recently available third-party\nvaluations of common stock and the board of directors’ assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from\nthe date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These third-party valuations were performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute\nof Certified Public Accountants’ Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (the Practice Aid). For grants\nmade after the Direct Listing, the fair value of common stock underlying stock-based awards is based on the closing price as reported on The Nasdaq Global Market on the date of\ngrant.\n● Expected Term—The expected term represents the period that a stock-based award is expected to be outstanding. The Company uses the simplified method to determine the\nexpected term, which is based on the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the option.\n● Expected Volatility— Due to the Company’s limited operating history and lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, the expected volatility is estimated based\non the average historical volatilities of common stock of comparable publicly traded entities over a period of time commensurate with the expected term of the stock option grants.\nThe comparable companies are chosen based on their size, stage in the product development cycle, or area of specialty. The Company will continue to apply this process until\nsufficient historical information regarding the volatility of its own stock price becomes available.\n● Risk-Free Interest Rate—The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities\napproximately equal to the expected term of the awards.\n● Expected Dividend—The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and has no plans to pay dividends on its common stock. Therefore, the Company used an\nexpected dividend yield of zero.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWith the completion of the Direct Listing, the Company is an emerging growth company (“EGC”), as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”). Under the\nJOBS Act, an EGC can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies.\nThe Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies;\nhowever, the Company may adopt new or revised accounting standards early if the standard allows for early adoption.\n12\nIn addition, the Company will utilize other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided to EGCs by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, an\nEGC is not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on the Company’s system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-EGC public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the\nauditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), or (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items,\nsuch as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment\nexpenses and by extending the disclosure requirements to entities with a single reportable segment. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2023-07 is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the Unaudited\nCondensed Financial Statements. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of this new guidance may have on the Company’s Unaudited Condensed Financial\nStatements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). The guidance in ASU 2023-09 improves\nthe transparency of income tax disclosures by greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The standard is effective for\npublic companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-09 may\nhave on its Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements.\n3. Net Income/(Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe following table summarizes the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of the Company:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet loss $ (500) $ (2,193) $ (8,062) $ (6,768)\nAdjustment to numerator for earnings per share:\nDeemed dividend — — — (2,573)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (500) $ (2,193) $ (8,062) $ (9,341)\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average number of common shares outstanding, basic and\ndiluted 33,516,656 28,230,842 32,457,473 28,230,842\nNet loss per common share attributable to common stockholders, basic and\ndiluted $ (0.01) $ (0.08) $ (0.25) $ (0.33)\nAs further described in Note 6, the Company issued 28,230,842 shares of non-voting common stock on August 18, 2022. Because the issuance of nonvoting common stock shares was\ntreated as a stock split for accounting purposes, these shares are treated as having been issued on January 1, 2022. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, is based upon the non-voting common stock shares issued on August 18, 2022. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 is based upon the non-voting common stock shares issued on August 18, 2022, the conversion of all outstanding shares of non-voting common stock, Series\nB Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock into voting common stock upon completion of the Direct Listing on January 31, 2024, the issuance of 227,057 shares of common stock issued\nto GEM Global Yield LLC SCS, or GEM, in February through March 2024, and the issuance of 1,198,836 shares of common stock to GEM in July through September 2024.\nAs further described in Note 7, the Company issued 741,164 shares of common stock to GEM in September 2024 to facilitate a Draw Down Notice. For accounting purposes, these shares\nare not considered issued as of September 30, 2024, because no proceeds were received for these shares at issuance and the shares will either be purchased by GEM through a subsequent\nClosing Notice and payment or returned to the Company, so these shares are contingently returnable.\nAs further described in Note 10, the Company agreed to pay to FibroGenesis 15% of the gross proceeds from any equity investments in FibroBiologics prior to an IPO, Direct Listing or\nSale of the Company to eliminate upon the occurrence of such event the Series A Preferred Stock and its $35 million liquidation preference. This redemption of preferred stock created a\nderivative liability that exceeded the net Parent Investment of $1,461 thousand by $1,112 thousand, and is reflected as a reduction of the amount available to common stockholders in the\ncalculation of earnings per share.\n13\nThe Company had $5,600 thousand of convertible notes outstanding as of December 31, 2022, which could have been converted into common stock in the event that the Company sold and\nissued shares of capital stock in excess of $10,000 thousand. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, $0 and $5,600 thousand, respectively, of the outstanding convertible\nnotes were converted into shares of Series B Preferred Stock. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported net losses and, accordingly, potential common\nshares were not included since such inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. No convertible notes were outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The\nCompany’s basic and diluted net losses per share are the same because it generated a net loss in all periods presented.\n4. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, net consist of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nLaboratory equipment $ 882 $ 816\nComputer equipment, software, and other 47 28\nTotal property and equipment at cost 929 844\nLess: Accumulated depreciation (157) (47)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 772 $ 797\nThe useful life of laboratory equipment is five years, and the useful life of computer equipment, software, and other is three years for deprecation. Depreciation expense was $38 thousand\nand $13 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was $110 thousand and $16 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\n5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company measured its derivative liability related to the conversion option feature in the 2022 Notes at fair value. As of September 30, 2023, $5,600 thousand\nof the 2022 Notes had been converted, which eliminated $538 thousand of the derivative liability.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company measured its liability instrument to investors under the Share Purchase Agreement, as further described in Note 7, at $7,236 thousand. This liability\ninstrument was comprised of a warrant liability and a forward contract liability, both of which were contingent upon an IPO event, and is classified within Level 3 of the value hierarchy\nbecause the liability was based upon a valuation model that used inputs and assumptions including potential outcomes, interest rates, probabilities, and timing. The Company completed its\nDirect Listing on January 31, 2024, which qualified as an IPO event, and bifurcated the liability instrument into its separate Warrant liability and Forward contract liability components. The fair\nvalue of the Warrant liability to be issued upon completion of the Direct Listing on January 31, 2024 was $20,963 thousand, and this fair value decreased to $2,887 thousand at September 30,\n2024. The fair value of the Forward contract liability was de minimis at January 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024.\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on the three-tier fair value hierarchy:\nFair Value Measurement as of September 30, 2024\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nCash equivalents $ 6,488 $ — $ — $ 6,488\nTotal assets fair value $ 6,488 $ — $ — $ 6,488\nLiabilities:\nForward contract liability $ — $ — $ 241 $ 241\nWarrant liability — — 2,887 2,887\nTotal liabilities fair value $ — $ — $ 3,128 $ 3,128\nFair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2023\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities:\nLiability instrument $ — $ — $ 7,236 $ 7,236\nTotal fair value $ — $ — $ 7,236 $ 7,236\n14\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to Level 3 financial liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nForward\nLiability Contract Warrant\n(in thousands) Instrument Liability Liability\nFair value at December 31, 2023 $ 7,236 $ — $ —\nBifurcation of the liability instrument upon\nDirect Listing (7,236) 7,236\nIncrease in Warrant liability at issuance\nJanuary 31, 2024 — — 13,727\nForward contract liability as of June 30,\n2024 — 1,500 —\nChange in fair value of Forward contract\nliability — (1,259) —\nChange in fair value of Warrant liability — — (18,076)\nFair value at September 30, 2024 $ — $ 241 $ 2,887\nAs of December 31, 2023, the liability instrument included the contingent warrant liability and the contingent put option (forward contract) liability as a single unit of account. The liability\ninstrument value was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model and management’s assumption of a 50% likelihood as of December 31, 2023, of becoming a public company prior to\nthe expiration of the Stock Purchase Agreement. Inputs used in the Black-Scholes valuation model included an estimated number of warrants, an assumed common stock share price of $15.00\nper share, the five-year time to maturity, a 0% dividend yield, an annual risk-free interest rate of 3.84% for the five-year time to maturity, and an assumed annualized volatility of 96% based on\ncomparable companies with a five-year history of stock prices.\nUpon completion of the Direct Listing on January 31, 2024, the warrant liability and the forward contract liability were no longer contingent and were bifurcated out of the liability\ninstrument and treated as separate units of account. As of January 31, 2024, the warrant liability value for the warrant issued to GEM Yield Bahamas Limited (“GYBL”) was determined using a\nBlack-Scholes valuation model. Inputs used in the Black-Scholes valuation model included the 1,299,783 warrants issued to GYBL, the closing bid price of $21.54 per share on January 31,\n2024, the five-year time to maturity, a 0% dividend yield, an annual risk-free interest rate of 3.91% for the five-year time to maturity, and an assumed annualized volatility of 97% based on\ncomparable companies with a five-year history of stock prices. As of September 30, 2024, the warrant liability value for the warrant issued to GYBL was determined using a Black-Scholes\nvaluation model. Inputs used in the Black-Scholes valuation model included the 1,299,783 warrants issued to GYBL, the closing bid price of $3.09 per share on September 30, 2024, the four-\nyear time to maturity, a 0% dividend yield, an annual risk-free interest rate of 3.58% for the five-year time to maturity, and an assumed annualized volatility of 100% based on comparable\ncompanies with a five-year history of stock prices.\nAs further described in Note 7, the Company issued a Draw Down Notice on September 12, 2024, for 1,000,000 shares. On September 26, 2024, an initial Closing Notice was provided by\nGEM to purchase 258,836 shares and the remainder of the Draw Down Notice remained open. The fair value of the remaining forward contract liability was remeasured at September 30, 2024,\nbased upon the remaining 741,164 shares, a price per share of $3.25, based on the floor price of $3.25 per share because the closing price was lower than the floor price on September 30, 2024,\nand the 10% discount to be provided to the investor purchasing the shares from the Company.\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and Parent company payable and receivable approximate\ntheir fair values due to their short-term maturities.\nThere were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n15\n6. Stockholders’ Equity/(Deficit) / Net Parent Investment\nAuthorized Capital – As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company authorized 10,000,000 and 20,000,000, respectively, preferred stock shares. As of December 31,\n2023, the Company had issued 8,750,000 Series A Preferred Stock shares to FibroGenesis, which were tendered pursuant to the formation of the Company in exchange for the contribution of\ncertain in-process research and development and patent assets through Patent Assignment and Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreements. The Series A Preferred Stock shares had the right\nto vote and ranked prior to non-voting common stock and common stock with respect to payment of dividends and distributions and upon liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or otherwise. In\naddition, the Series “A” Preferred Stock had a liquidation preference equal to $35,000 thousand to be allocated among the holders of the Series “A” Preferred Stock shares in the event of a\nliquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Company, which was subsequently eliminated as part of the ROFN Agreement as further described below, and each share of Series “A” Preferred\nStock could be converted into one share of common stock at any time at the election of the holder of such shares of Series “A” Preferred Stock. Unless otherwise elected by the holder(s), a\nmerger or consolidation in which the Company is not the majority surviving entity or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation would be a deemed liquidation event. The\nCompany has also authorized 62,500,000 shares of non-voting common stock, and has issued during the year ended December 31, 2022, a total of 28,230,842 shares. In August 2022, the\nCompany issued 28,179,592 shares of non-voting common stock to its Parent, which in turn distributed the shares to its members. This issuance of non-voting common stock was accounted for\nas stock split and no proceeds were received by the Company. The Company also issued to its board of directors, a consultant, and an employee an additional 51,250 total shares in 2022 and\nrecorded $168 thousand of expense for the issuance of these shares, which was based upon a third-party valuation of the shares at the time of issuance.\nIn December 2022, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to authorize 2,500,000 shares of Series “B” Preferred Stock. The Series “B” Preferred Stock had a liquidation\npreference after Series “A” Preferred Stock and prior to Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock. The Series “B” Preferred Stock had voting rights and would automatically convert into\nCommon Stock upon closing of an IPO transaction, as defined in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\nIn January 2023, to reflect the ROFN Agreement with its Parent, as further discussed in Note 10, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to a) make the Series “B” Preferred\nStock liquidation preference equal to Series “A” Preferred Stock, and b) to provide that upon IPO, Direct Listing, or Sale of the Company, the Series “A” Preferred Stock would be canceled for\nno consideration.\nIn March 2023, the Company accepted a stock subscription to purchase shares of Series B Preferred Stock for $10,000 thousand and recorded a stock subscription payable for the full\namount of the $10,000 thousand of proceeds received in March 2023. The stock subscription payable as of March 31, 2023, was subsequently eliminated in April 2023 when the Company\nissued the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to the shareholder.\nIn April 2023, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to authorize 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock, increase the number of authorized Series “B” Preferred Stock\nshares up to 5,000,000 shares, and to authorize 5,000,000 shares of Series “B-1” Preferred Stock with liquidation preference equal to the Series “A” and “B” Preferred Stock. The Series “B-1”\nPreferred Stock had voting rights and would automatically convert into Common Stock upon closing of an IPO transaction, as defined in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation.\n16\nIn October 2023, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware to increase to 100,000,000 shares its authorized shares of voting common\nstock, par value $0.00001 per share, reduce to 30,000,000 shares its authorized shares of non-voting common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, and authorize 2,500 shares of Series C\nPreferred Stock, par value $0.00001 per share. The Series C Preferred Stock ranked senior to common stock and non-voting common stock and junior to the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B\nPreferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock upon liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or otherwise. The Series C Preferred Stock had no voting rights prior to an IPO, and 13,000 votes per\nshare upon closing of an IPO. The Series C Preferred Stock is not entitled to dividends, has a liquidation preference of $18.00 per share, subject to adjustment, may be converted 1:1 at any time\nat the option of the holder into common stock, and upon closing of an IPO, would, if transferred, automatically convert 1:1 into common stock.\nIn January 2024, the Company issued 2,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock to its CEO, who in turn granted a proxy to the Board of Directors to vote these shares as outlined in the\namended and restated certification of incorporation.\nOn January 31, 2024, the Company completed its Direct Listing, which qualified as an IPO transaction. As a result of the IPO, the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock shares were\ncanceled for no consideration and the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, and non-voting common stock shares were all converted 1:1 into shares of voting\ncommon stock. In addition, the Series C Preferred Stock voting rights increased from none to 13,000 votes per share and, if transferred, these shares will automatically convert 1:1 into common\nstock.\nIn August 2024, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware to eliminate its non-voting common stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B\nPreferred Stock, and Series B-1 Preferred Stock, and to reduce to 10,000,000 shares its authorized preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of which 2,500 shares are designated as Series\nC Preferred Stock.\n7. Share Subscription Agreement\nOn November 12, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with certain investors for the sale of up to $100,000 thousand of common stock (the “Aggregate Limit”).\nThis agreement was contingent upon the Company achieving a public listing of its common stock. Major terms of the agreement include a commitment fee of 2% of the Aggregate Limit, which\nis due no later than one year after public listing even if no drawdowns are taken, and five-year warrants issued to the investors at the time of public listing to purchase common stock equal to\n4% of the total equity interests of the Company at the lesser of a) the price per share at the time of the public listing or b) the quotient of $700,000 thousand divided by the total number of\nequity interests (fully diluted common shares). The Company may request a drawdown, or sale of common stock shares to the investors, over the five-year term of this agreement following the\npublic listing unless terminated earlier. The amount of the drawdowns requested is limited by the trading volumes of the Company’s common stock over the 30-day period preceding the\ndrawdown, and the price per share is equal to 90% of the average price per share over that same period. A 1% fee was due to the investors if the Company were sold in a private sale transaction\nrather than completing a public listing of its shares.\nAfter completion of its public listing on January 31, 2024, and during the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company sold a total of 227,057 shares of common stock for $2,819\nthousand of net proceeds through the Share Purchase Agreement.\nUpon completion of its public listing the Company recorded a payable of $2,000 thousand for the commitment fee obligation due under the Share Purchase Agreement within one year, and\nexpensed the $1,941 thousand remaining amount of the commitment fee at March 31, 2024.\nOn June 27, 2024, the Company issued 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock to facilitate a Draw Down Notice under the Share Purchase Agreement. The Company recorded upon issuance a\n$1,410 thousand fair value of the forward contract liability for its requirement to sell up to 3,000,000 shares to the investor at 90% of the average closing price per share during the Draw Down\nPeriod based upon the number of shares, the closing price per share of $4.66 on June 27, 2024, and the 10% discount to be provided to the investor purchasing the shares from the Company.\nThe fair value of the forward contract liability was remeasured to $638 thousand at July 11, 2024, upon receipt of the Closing Notice from GEM, based upon the 840,000 shares accepted, the\n$.4.85 closing price per share, and a net purchase price per share of $4.09 after the 10% discount provided to the investor, and the forward contract liability was eliminated. GEM returned\n560,000 shares to the Company, which canceled those shares, and the remaining 1,600,000 shares were retained by GEM to facilitate a subsequent Draw Down Notice.\nOn July 12, 2024, the Company issued a Draw Down Notice for 1,600,000 shares. The Company recorded upon issuance a $758 thousand fair value of the forward contract liability for its\nrequirement to sell up to 1,600,000 shares to the investor at 90% of the average closing price per share during the Draw Down Period based upon the number of shares, the closing price per\nshare of $4.74 on July 12, 2024, and the 10% discount to be provided to the investor purchasing the shares from the Company. The fair value of the forward contract liability was remeasured to\na $286 thousand asset at August 26, 2024, upon receipt of the Closing Notice from GEM, based upon the 100,000 shares accepted, the $1.65 closing price per share, and a net price per share of\n$4.51 after the 10% discount provided to the investor, and the forward contract liability was eliminated. GEM returned 500,000 shares to the Company, which canceled those shares, and the\nremaining 1,000,000 shares were retained by GEM to facilitate a subsequent Draw Down Notice.\nOn September 12, 2024, the Company issued a Draw Down Notice for 1,000,000 shares. The Company recorded upon issuance a $325 thousand fair value of the forward contract liability\nfor its requirement to sell up to 1,000,000 shares to the investor at 90% of the average closing price per share during the Draw Down Period based upon the number of shares, a price per share\nof $3.25, based on the floor price of $3.25 per share because the closing price was lower than the floor price on September 12, 2024, and the 10% discount to be provided to the investor\npurchasing the shares from the Company. Upon receipt of an initial Closing Notice from GEM on September 26, 2024, the fair value of the portion of the forward contract liability covered by\nthe Closing Notice was remeasured to $57 thousand at, based upon the 258,836 shares accepted, the $3.14 price per share, and a net price per share of $2.93 after the 10% discount provided to\nthe investor, and that portion of the forward contract liability was eliminated. The September 12, 2024, Draw Down Notice remained open for 741,164 shares, which will either be sold to GEM\npursuant to a future Closing Notice or returned to the Company. The fair value of the of the remaining portion of the forward contract liability was remeasured at September 30, 2024, based on\nthe remaining 741,164 shares, a price per share of $3.25, based on the floor price of $3.25 per share because the closing price was lower than the floor price on September 30, 2024, and the\n10% discount to be provided to the investor purchasing the shares from the Company.\n8. Income Taxes\nThe Company did not record any tax provision or benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Management has evaluated the positive and negative evidence\nbearing upon the realizability of the Company’s net deferred tax assets and has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of the net deferred tax\nassets. As a result, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.\n9. Leases, Commitments and Contingencies\n17\nIn October 2022, the Company entered into a lease agreement for office space with a term of 62 months, which expires on November 30, 2027. This lease is accounted for as an operating\nlease under the ASC 842 guidance for lease accounting. A right-of-use lease asset and lease liability of $2,293 thousand each were recorded at inception of the lease term using a discount rate\nof 7.5%.\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into a new lease for temporary lab and office space for its research operations. This lease has a term of 12 months and monthly rent of $6 thousand and\nis accounted for as a short-term lease. This lease commenced in August 2023. In September 2023, the Company entered into an amendment of this lease for additional space, and the monthly\nrent increased to $7 thousand. In March 2024, the Company entered into a second amendment of this lease for additional space, and effective April 1, 2024, the monthly rent increased to $8\nthousand. In July 2024, the Company signed an amendment of this lease, effective August 1, 2024, to extend the term for an additional 12 months, and the monthly rent decreased to $7\nthousand.\nRent expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $466 thousand and $504 thousand, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, noncancelable lease payments\nunder operating leases were $1,629 thousand and noncancelable lease payments under short-term leases were $74 thousand.\nAs of September 30, 2024, future minimum payments during the remaining period and the next five years are as follows (in thousands):\n2024 $ 88\n2025 488\n2026 544\n2027 509\n2028 —\nThereafter —\nTotal lease payments 1,629\nLess: Imputed interest (182)\nTotal lease liabilities 1,447\nLess: Current lease liabilities (392)\nTotal non-current lease liabilities $ 1,055\n10. Related Party Transactions\nAs described in Note 6, the Company acquired from FibroGenesis certain in-process research and development and patent assets through Patent Assignment and Intellectual Property\nCross-License Agreements. The Patent Assignment Agreement transferred the right, title and interest in and to certain patents from FibroGenesis to the Company for further development. The\nIntellectual Property Cross-License Agreement grants to the Company exclusive rights to patents owned by FibroGenesis in a limited field of use, which includes the diagnosis, treatment,\nprevention and palliation of a) spinal diseases, disorders, or conditions, b) cancer, c) orthopedics diseases, disorders or conditions, and d) multiple sclerosis.\nIn January 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement Regarding Right of First Negotiation (“ROFN Agreement”) with its Parent, FibroGenesis. In exchange for FibroGenesis’ consent\nto amend the Certificate of Incorporation to a) eliminate upon IPO, Direct Listing, or Sale of the Company the Series A Preferred Stock $35,000 thousand liquidation preference, b) make the\nSeries B Preferred Stock liquidation preference equal to Series “A” Preferred Stock, and c) to provide that upon IPO, Direct Listing, or Sale of the Company Series A Preferred Stock will be\ncancelled for no consideration, FibroBiologics agreed to pay to FibroGenesis 15% of the gross proceeds from any equity investments in FibroBiologics prior to an IPO, Direct Listing or Sale of\nthe Company. In addition, FibroBiologics received a five-year right of first negotiation if FibroGenesis decides to license externally any of its technology. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to reflect these changes, recorded a derivative liability of $2,573 thousand for the expected future payments to\nFibroGenesis, and paid $2,645 thousand to FibroGenesis for 15% of the gross proceeds from equity issued by the Company through the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and recorded a\nloss on derivative liability of $15 thousand. Based on its relationship to Series A Preferred Stock as described above, the derivative liability was recorded first against the net Parent Investment\nand then to Additional paid-in capital after the net Parent Investment was eliminated. Amounts paid in excess of the derivative liability are recorded as other losses in the Unaudited Condensed\nStatements of Operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed its Direct Listing, which resulted in the cancelation of all outstanding shares of Series A\nPreferred Stock for no consideration, and paid $141 thousand to FibroGenesis. There was no derivative liability as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There was a payable to\nFibroGenesis of $0 and $141 thousand, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n18\n11. Share-Based Compensation\nThe Company adopted on August 10, 2022, and the stockholders approved on August 18, 2022, the 2022 Stock Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock\noptions, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, and other stock awards. The Plan, through the grant of stock awards, is\nintended to help the Company secure and retain the services of eligible award recipients, provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company and\nprovide a means by which the eligible recipients may benefit from increases in value of the common stock. In September 2022, the Company issued a total of 101,250 options with a strike\nprice of $3.28 per share to employees, directors, and scientific advisory board members under this Plan. In February 2023, the Company issued a total of 3,689,750 options with a strike price of\n$2.28 per share to employees and directors under this Plan. In August 2023, a total of 2,500 options with a strike price of $3.28 per share were forfeited. In March 2024, the Company issued\n216,875 options with a strike price of $13.00 per share to employees under this Plan. In June 2024, the Company issued 6,875 options with a strike price of $6.73 per share to employees under\nthis Plan. In August 2024, the Company issued 25,000 options with a strike price of $1.73 per share to directors under this Plan. Generally, awards granted by the Company vest over four years\nand have an exercise price equal to the estimated fair value of the common stock as determined by the board of directors with consideration given to contemporaneous valuations of the\nCompany’s common stock prepared by an independent third-party valuation firm for options granted prior to public listing or the closing bid price on the date of grant for options granted after\npublic listing.\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were 8,467,889 and 8,711,500 shares, respectively, available for future issuance under the Plan.\nStock-based compensation expense is recognized in the Unaudited Condensed Statements of Operations as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in thousands of dollars) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nResearch and development $ 82 $ 66 $ 248 $ 196\nGeneral, administrative and other 490 374 1,383 1,137\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 572 $ 440 $ 1,631 $ 1,333\nIn addition to the $1,631 thousand stock-based compensation expense for stock options, a $45 thousand stock-based compensation expense was recognized for the grant of 2,500\nshares of Series C Preferred Stock to the CEO during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nUnrecognized stock-based compensation costs related to unvested awards and the weighted-average period over which the costs are expected to be recognized as of September 30,\n2024, are as follows:\nStock Options\nUnrecognized stock-based compensation expense (in thousands) $ 5,766\nExpected weighted-average period compensation costs to be recognized (years) 2.6\nA summary of the Company’s stock option activity is as follows:\nWeighted-Average\nWeighted-Average Remaining Aggregate\nExercise Price per Contractual Life Intrinsic Value\nStock Options Share (years) (in thousands)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 3,788,500 $ 2.31 8.4 $ 2,989\nGranted 248,750 $ 11.69 9.5 $ 34\nExercised — $ — — $ —\nForfeited/Cancelled (5,139) $ 12.74 9.4 $ —\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2024 4,032,111 $ 2.88 8.4 $ 3,023\nExercisable as of September 30, 2024 1,696,210 $ 2.33 8.4 $ 1,307\nThe fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors, and consultants was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following\nassumptions:\nNine Months Nine Months\nEnded Ended\nSeptember September\nAssumptions: 30, 2024 30, 2023\nRisk-free interest rate 3.7 to 4.3% 3.9%\nExpected volatility 97 to 101% 90%\nExpected term (years) 5.5 to 7.0 7.0\nExpected dividend 0% 0%\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the weighted-average grant date fair value of the options granted was $9.70 per share.\n12. Subsequent Events\nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events through November 12, 2024, the date these unaudited condensed financial statements were issued, and determined that there have been no\nevents that have occurred that would require adjustments to the disclosures in these unaudited condensed Financial Statements, other than the following.\nOn October 18, 2024, the Company received a Closing Notice from GEM to purchase 15,683 shares at a price of $2.91 per share for proceeds of $46 thousand.\n19\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited financial statements and notes thereto included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report and with the\naudited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing fibroblast-based therapies for patients suffering from chronic diseases with significant unmet\nmedical needs, including wound healing, multiple sclerosis (MS), degenerative disc disease, psoriasis and certain cancers, and potential human longevity applications including thymic\ninvolution reversal. At present, our novel manufacturing process entails collecting excess tissue from surgical procedures and using the allogeneic fibroblasts to grow a cell bank for use in our\nprocedures. Our most advanced product candidates are CYWC628, CYMS101 and CybroCell™.\nWe are in the late pre-clinical stages of developing CYWC628 as an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy for wound healing. Our studies are presently focused on utilizing fibroblasts and\nfibroblast-derived cells to treat wounds in diabetic mice. The results of our studies to date have shown statistically significant acceleration in the rate of wound closure in comparison with both\na marketed wound care product and control, and improved quality of healed wounds. Based upon our results achieved to date and the expected timing of our remaining preclinical studies, we\nare planning to initiate a twelve-week Phase 1/2 clinical trial in Australia for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in the second quarter of 2025 as funding allows.\nWe are developing CYMS101 as an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy to treat MS. After completing animal studies using CYMS101, we received approval to conduct clinical\ninvestigations in Mexico using the fibroblast cell composition for patients with MS and have completed a Phase 1 study. The study was conducted in five participants. The primary objective of\nthe study was to assess safety, and the secondary objective was to assess efficacy. The primary objective was achieved as we saw no adverse events related to the treatment. We are currently\nconducting further research to determine the mode of action of fibroblasts in oligodendrocyte expansion and expect to file an IND application for a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in MS as funding\nallows. We will likely seek a strategic partner to collaborate with us on the development of CYMS101 either before initiating the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, or after its completion, if successful,\nand prior to commencing with a Phase 3 clinical trial.\nCybroCell™ is an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy for degenerative disc disease and is being designed as an alternative method for repairing the cartilage of the intervertebral disc (or\nany other articular cartilage). We have completed two animal studies. The results from the studies were positive and resulted in “first in human” trial approval. We have received IND clearance\nfrom the FDA, conditional upon approval of our master cell bank, to run a Phase 1 study for patients suffering from degenerative disc disease and will be conducting this study within the\nUnited States. A timeline will be determined through discussions with the FDA and as funding allows.\nCYPS317 is our allogeneic intravenously administered fibroblast cell-based therapeutic for the treatment of psoriasis. We are moving this early phase project to our product candidate pipeline.\nOur early pre-clinical animal model studies have demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of mild and severe psoriasis. Our studies have also demonstrated improved efficacy as\ncompared to anti IL-23 monoclonal antibody, with no adverse effects noted with the respiratory, circulatory, hepatic and renal organ systems. We are currently in the process of continuing our\nIND-enabling animal model studies, with a projected completion timeline of the fourth quarter of 2025.\nWe also have human longevity, cancer, and artificial pancreatic organoid programs in the early stages of development, and we plan to accelerate such programs as funding allows.\nWe currently utilize a CDMO to manufacture our cell therapy product candidates. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we will evaluate the longer-term feasibility of building\nour own cGMP manufacturing facility or continuing to outsource production to a CDMO for clinical testing and commercial sales.\nSince our spinoff from FibroGenesis in April 2021, our operations have included business planning, hiring personnel, raising capital, building our intellectual property portfolio, and performing\nresearch and development on our product candidates and our fibroblast technology, leveraging the clinical benefits of fibroblasts as the basis of our cell therapy platform.\nWe have incurred net losses since Inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities. To date, we have funded our operations primarily\nthrough investment from FibroGenesis, the issuance of $5.6 million of our convertible promissory notes from December 2021 through April 2022, the issuance of $18.6 million of preferred\nstock, and the issuance of $8.0 million of common stock.\n20\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $7.8 million. Since our Inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We incurred net losses of\napproximately $8.1 million and $6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately\n$32.4 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the next several years. See “—Funding Requirements” below.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase substantially if and as we:\n● advance the development of our lead product candidates through clinical development, and, if approved by the FDA, commercialization;\n● advance our preclinical development programs into clinical development;\n● incur manufacturing costs for cell production to supply our product candidates;\n● seek regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n● increase our research and development activities to identify and develop new product candidates;\n● hire additional personnel;\n● expand our operational, financial and management systems;\n● meet the requirements and demands of being a public company;\n● invest in further development to protect and expand our intellectual property;\n● establish a sales, marketing, medical affairs, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval and intend to\ncommercialize; and\n● expand our manufacturing and develop our commercialization efforts.\nDue to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biopharmaceutical product development and the economic and developmental uncertainty, we may be unable to accurately predict\nthe timing or magnitude of all expenses. Our ability to ultimately generate revenue to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the development, approval, and subsequent commercialization\nof our product candidates. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be\nforced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our long-term continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue\nfrom product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, which may include collaborations with other companies or\nother strategic transactions. We may not be able to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital\nor enter into such agreements as and when needed, we will have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or\ndelay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions.\nGeneral Trends and Outlook\nRecent Developments\nCYWC628\nWe completed pre-clinical studies investigating (i) multiple administrations of CYWC628 on a chemically induced chronic wound NONcNZO10/LtJ mouse model, (ii) dose titration to provide\ninformation on the effective dose range of CYWC628, and (iii) acute and chronic toxicity. We expect to complete our remaining pre-clinical studies by the end of 2024.\nAs part of the preparation for a Phase I/II clinical trial of CYWC628 for the potential treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), we entered into a master service agreement with a CDMO that\nwill govern the production of our master cell bank, working cell bank, and our CYWC628 drug product candidate. We also entered into a master service agreement with a CRO that will carry\nout the Phase I/II clinical trial of CYWC628 for the potential treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in Australia in 2025.\nPsoriasis\nWe have completed an early phase project utilizing a psoriasis mouse model to assess the potential use of intravenous administration of fibroblast spheroids for the treatment of psoriasis.\nResults to date include that a single administration of fibroblast spheroids resulted in significant improvement in mice with moderate psoriasis, and that multiple administrations of fibroblast\nspheroids resulted in significant improvement in mice with severe psoriasis. We also compared fibroblast spheroid with single and multiple administration of an anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody\nin treatment of mice with mild to moderate psoriasis. We noted that a single treatment of fibroblast spheroids was significantly better than single and multiple administration of an anti-IL-23\nmonoclonal antibody. We are in the process of carrying out a dosage titration animal model study to determine optimal efficacious dose range, in addition to determining the durability of\ntreatment for mild to moderate, and moderate to severe psoriasis. Three anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody treatments are approved by the FDA for the treatment of psoriasis, including Tremfya®,\nIllumya®, and Skyrizi®. As a result of these studies, we have moved this project to our product candidate pipeline with the name of CYPS317.\nIntellectual Property\nWe have filed two new patent applications with the United States Patent Office. The first patent application covers the use of fibroblast cell-based technology in an adhesive bandage for wound\nhealing. The second patent application covers the use of fibroblast cell-based technology in generating three-dimensional hemopoietic organoids that can give rise to functional immune cells.\n21\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for any\nof our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. We cannot predict if, when or to what extent we will\ngenerate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates and include:\n● employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation for our research and development personnel;\n● laboratory equipment and supplies;\n● direct third-party costs such as expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and CDMOs;\n● consultants that conduct research and development activities on our behalf;\n● costs associated with conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n● costs associated with technology; and\n● facilities and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and other facility related costs and other supplies.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development\nactivities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing our\nproduct candidates as they advance into later stages of clinical development and our other product candidates in preclinical development as they advance into clinical development. The process\nof conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. As a\nresult, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization\nand sale of any of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including uncertainty related to:\n● the duration, costs and timing of clinical trials for our current development programs and any further clinical trials related to new product candidates;\n● the sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n● the acceptance of IND applications for future clinical trials;\n● the successful and timely enrollment and completion of clinical trials;\n● the successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n● successful data from our clinical program that supports an acceptable risk-benefit profile of our product candidates in the intended populations;\n● the receipt and maintenance of regulatory and marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n● establishing agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if any of our product candidates are approved;\n● the entry into collaborations to further the development of our product candidates;\n● obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; and\n● successfully launching our product candidates and achieving commercial sales, if and when approved.\n22\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our programs or any product candidate we develop would significantly change the costs,\ntiming and viability associated with the development and/or regulatory approval of such programs or product candidates.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses\nOur general, administrative, and other expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, allocated facilities costs, and other expenses for outside professional services, including legal, marketing,\ninvestor relations, human resources services, and accounting services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our general and administrative personnel.\nWe will continue to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, Nasdaq,\nadditional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. We also expect to increase the size of our administrative function to support the\ngrowth of our business.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense consists primarily of accrued interest expense and amortization of discount on our convertible notes.\nStatements of Operations\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change Amount\n2024 2023\n(unaudited, in thousands)\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 1,213 $ 571 $ 642\nGeneral, administrative and other 2,139 1,481 659\nTotal operating expenses 3,352 2,052 1,300\nLoss from operations (3,352) (2,052) (1,300)\nChange in fair value of liability instrument and warrant liability 1,927 — 1,927\nChange in fair value of forward contract liability 849 — 1,090\nOther income/(loss) 2 (141) 143\nInterest income 79 — 79\nInterest expense (5) — (5)\nNet loss $ (500) $ (2,193) $ 1,934\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change Amount\n2024 2023\n(unaudited, in thousands)\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 3,148 $ 1,595 $ 1,553\nGeneral, administrative and other 6,877 4,814 2,063\nTotal operating expenses 10,025 6,409 3,616\nLoss from operations (10,025) (6,409) (3,616)\nChange in fair value of liability instrument and warrant liability 4,349 — 4,349\nChange in fair value of future contract liability (651) — (410)\nCommitment fee expense (1,941) — (1,941)\nOther income/(loss) 32 (213) 245\nInterest income 188 — 188\nInterest expense (14) (146) 132\nNet loss $ (8,062) $ (6,768) $ (1,053)\n23\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses were $1.2 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $0.6 million was primarily due\nto:\n● increased tissue acquisition and CDMO costs of $0.3 million for cell manufacturing activities;\n● increased personnel related expenses of $0.2 million due to hiring additional research scientists after September 30, 2023; and\n● increased research materials and supplies expenses of $0.1 million due to increased laboratory personnel and preclinical studies.\nResearch and development expenses were $3.1 million and $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $1.5 million was primarily due\nto:\n● increased personnel related expenses of $0.6 million due to hiring additional research scientists after September 30, 2023;\n● increased tissue acquisition and CDMO costs of $0.5 million for cell manufacturing activities; and\n● increased research materials and supplies, conferences, and depreciation expenses of $0.4 million due to increased laboratory personnel and preclinical studies.\nResearch and development expenses are not tracked by product candidate.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses\nGeneral, administrative and other expenses were $2.1 million and $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $0.6 million was\nprimarily due to:\n● increased expense of $0.2 million for public company D&O insurance;\n● increased expenses of $0.2 million for patent filing and maintenance costs;\n● increased expenses of $0.2 million for added personnel in 2024;\n● increased expenses of $0.1 million for investor relations and marketing costs, and.\n● decreased expenses of $0.1 million for legal fees.\nGeneral, administrative and other expenses were $6.9 million and $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $2.1 million was primarily\ndue to:\n● increased expenses of $0.7 million for regulatory, listing, accounting, investor relations and marketing expenses related to our Direct Listing completed in January 2024 and subsequent\nfinancing efforts;\n● increased expenses of $0.7 million for added personnel in 2024;\n● increased expenses of $0.5 million for patent filing and maintenance costs;\n● increased expense of $0.5 million for public company D&O insurance;\n● decreased expenses of $0.3 million due to timing of an executive bonus in January 2023.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\nChange in fair value of warrant liability was a gain of $1.9 million and none for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The liability instrument to investors under\nthe Share Purchase Agreement among us, GEM Global Yield LLC SCS, or GEM, and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited, or GYBL, dated November 12, 2021, or the GEM SPA, was comprised of\nthe contingent warrant liability and contingent put option. The $1.9 million gain during the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulted from the mark to market of the warrant liability,\nwhich will occur at the end of each reporting period as long as the warrants are outstanding and classified as a liability.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability was a gain of $4.3 million and none for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This change in fair value resulted primarily\nfrom the decrease in our stock price.\nChange in fair value of forward contract liability\nChange in fair value of forward contract liability was a net gain of $0.8 million and $0.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A forward contract\nliability to sell shares to the investor at 90% of the average daily closing price per share over the Draw Down Pricing Period is recorded each time we issue a Draw Down Notice to GEM under\nthe Share Purchase Agreement. The forward contract liability is remeasured at the end of each quarter, if open, and again upon receipt of the Closing Notice from the investor. The forward\ncontract liability is eliminated upon receipt of the Closing Notice and funds from the investor.\nChange in fair value of forward contract liability was a net loss of $0.7 million and $0.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCommitment fee expense\nCommitment fee expense was $1.9 million and none for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A $2 million commitment fee pursuant to the GEM SPA became\npayable to GEM upon completion of the Direct Listing in January 2024. The commitment fee is payable to GEM as drawdown notices are issued, with any remaining balance payable one year\nafter public listing. We sold $3.0 million of common stock to GEM under the GEM SPA during the three months ended March 31, 2024, which made approximately $0.1 million of the\ncommitment fee payable immediately. This $0.1 million portion of the commitment fee was netted against the proceeds received in additional paid-in capital. The remaining $1.9 million was\nexpensed immediately because we were planning to raise funds through other sources and had no plans to issue further Draw Down Notices to GEM prior to the one-year anniversary of our\npublic listing when this remaining amount will be due.\nOther loss\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of other loss is comprised of the payments to FibroGenesis in excess of the derivative\nliability established at inception of the Agreement Regarding Right of First Negotiation entered into by us and FibroGenesis in January 2023, or the ROFN Agreement.\nInterest income\nInterest income is comprised of interest income and unrealized gain/losses on cash equivalents.\n24\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $0.0 million and $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of $0.1 million was due to the maturities and\nconversions of the notes during the year ended December 31, 2023. Interest expense was recorded in 2023 for the nominal interest rate of 6.0% plus the amortization of the discount on the 2022\nconvertible notes.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate was 0.0% for all periods. Currently, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily with investment from FibroGenesis, proceeds from borrowings under our convertible loan agreements, and proceeds from the issuance of\npreferred stock and common stock. From Inception through September 30, 2024, we have received gross proceeds of approximately $5.6 million from sales of our convertible notes, $18.6\nmillion from the issuance of preferred stock, and $8.0 million from the issuance of common stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $7.8 million\nand an accumulated deficit of approximately $32.3 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding debt.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (8,828) $ (4,800)\nNet cash used in investing activities (85) (493)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 7,577 13,793\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,336) $ 8,500\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $8.8 million and $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and consisted primarily of net losses of $8.1\nmillion and $6.8 million, respectively. Noncash losses on stock-based compensation expense of $1.7 million and change in fair value of forward contract liability of $0.7 million, and\namortization of operating lease right-of-use asset of $0.3 million, and change in commitment fee payable of $1.9 million partially offset the net loss, while noncash gain on change in fair value\nof liability instrument of $4.3 million, an increase in prepaid expenses of $0.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.3 million, a decrease in payable to Parent of\n$0.1 million, and a decrease in operating lease liability of $0.3 million added to the cash used in operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Noncash expenses of stock-based\ncompensation of $1.3 million, other loss on derivative liability of $0.1 million, amortization of convertible notes debt discount of $0.1 million, and amortization of operating lease right-of-use\nasset of $0.3 million, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.4 million and an increase in payable to Parent of $0.1 million partially offset the net loss, while a decrease\nin operating lease liability of $0.3 million added to the cash used in operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $0.1 million and $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and consist primarily of laboratory\nequipment purchases.\n25\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $7.6 million and $13.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, we entered into a $0.6 million short-term borrowing agreement to finance the D&O insurance policy premiums and repaid $0.5 million of the principal borrowed,\nand we raised $7.5 million of net proceeds from the sale of common stock under the GEM SPA. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid to FibroGenesis $2.6 million under\nthe ROFN Agreement, we received $0.3 million from FibroGenesis’ repayment of its note payable to us, and we received $15.2 million in total net proceeds from the issuance of Series B\nPreferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock.\nFunding Requirements\nWe do not have any products approved for sale, and we have never generated any revenue from contracts with customers. We do not expect to generate any meaningful revenue unless and until\nwe obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our current or future product candidates and we do not know when, or if, that will occur. We expect to continue to incur significant\nlosses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our current and future product candidates, and begin\nto commercialize any approved products. We are subject to all the risks typically related to the development of new product candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties,\ncomplications, delays, and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. Moreover, we will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nThe financial statements have been prepared as though we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of\nbusiness. We have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since Inception. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $32.4 million.\nManagement expects to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows.\nThese factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the financial statements. Our ability to continue as a going concern is\ndependent on the Company’s ability to raise additional capital. We will need to raise additional capital to continue to fund our operations. We believe we will be able to obtain additional capital\nthrough equity financings or other arrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that such additional financing, if available, can be obtained on acceptable terms. If we\nare unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n● the initiation, progress, timeline, cost and results of our clinical trials for our product candidates;\n● the initiation, progress, timeline, cost and results of additional research and preclinical studies related to pipeline development and other research programs we initiate in the future;\n● the cost and timing of manufacturing activities, including our planned manufacturing scale-up activities associated with our product candidates and other programs as we advance them\nthrough preclinical and clinical development through commercialization;\n● the potential expansion of our current development programs to seek new indications;\n● the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n● the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, in-licensed or otherwise;\n26\n● the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n● the payment of licensing fees, potential royalty payments and potential milestone payments;\n● the cost of general operating expenses;\n● the cost of establishing sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval in regions where we choose to\ncommercialize our products on our own; and\n● the costs of operating as a public company.\nFurther, our operating plan may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials and other research and development\nexpenditures.\nIf we need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we\nmay have to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our preclinical studies, clinical trials, research and development programs or commercialization efforts. We may seek to raise\nany necessary additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, and other licensing arrangements. If we raise additional capital\nthrough debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring\ndividends. If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have\nto relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nMaterial contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of operating leases. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable leases as of September 30,\n2024, were approximately $1.6 million, of which $0.5 million is due within one year. We generally expect to satisfy these commitments with cash on hand and cash provided by financing\nactivities.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The\npreparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an\nongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for\nmaking judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions\nor conditions.\nWe define our critical accounting estimates as those under GAAP that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material\nimpact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates,\nplease see the disclosures in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a\nForward contract liability with each Draw Down Notice issued to GEM and have remeasured this Forward contract liability at each quarter end and upon receipt of each Closing Notice from\nGEM. Other than the Forward contract liability critical accounting estimates and changes in the fair value of the Warrant liability, as described in this Quarterly Report, there have not been any\nmaterial changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since December 31, 2023.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and are not required to provide the information\nspecified under this item.\n27\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a–15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports\nunder the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls\nand procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision, and with the participation, of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10–Q. During the preparation of our financial\nstatements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to a lack of segregation of duties. A\nmaterial weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement\nof our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nSpecifically, our management identified a material weakness in our internal controls within the financial reporting function that resulted from an ineffective design and implementation of\ncontrols over proper segregation of duties for the period of time covered by our financial statements due to a limited number of individuals. Based upon such evaluation, and due to the material\nweakness identified, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.\nRemediation Plan for Material Weakness\nWe will continue to add staff, evaluate segregation of duties, and implement initiatives to improve our internal controls over financial reporting as we grow.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that occurred during the three months ended September 30,\n2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of inherent\nlimitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within an organization have been detected. Accordingly, our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. We\ncontinue to implement, improve, and refine our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting.\n28\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings relating to intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Such matters\nare subject to uncertainty and there can be no assurance that such legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash\nflows. We are not party to any legal proceedings at this time.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to risks, uncertainties, and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our securities. Except\nas set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIn connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report, our management concluded that there is substantial doubt as to whether we can continue as a going concern for the twelve months\nfollowing the issuance of this Quarterly Report. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising capital to maintain current operations and continue research and\ndevelopment efforts. We plan to raise additional capital to fund our operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, and/or potential collaborations and license\narrangements or other sources. There is no assurance, however, that any additional financing or any revenue-generating collaboration will be available when needed or that we will be able to\nobtain financing or enter into a collaboration on terms acceptable to us.\nThese factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may materially and adversely affect the\nprice per share of our common stock, and it may be more difficult for us to obtain financing. If existing or potential collaborators decline to do business with us or potential investors decline to\nparticipate in any future financings due to such concerns, our ability to increase our cash position may be limited. The perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may\ncause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations. We have prepared our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on\na going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Our unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this Quarterly Report do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a\ngoing concern, we will be forced to delay, reduce or discontinue our research and development programs or consider other various strategic alternatives and you could lose all or part of your\ninvestment in us.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nThe following sets forth information regarding all unregistered securities we sold during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Unless stated otherwise, the sales of the securities listed\nbelow were deemed to be exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, including Regulation D and Rule 506 promulgated thereunder, as transactions by an issuer\nnot involving a public offering.\nOn June 27, 2024, the Company issued 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock to facilitate a Draw Down Notice under the Share Purchase Agreement.

Business\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage cell therapy company focused on developing and commercializing fibroblast-based therapies for patients suffering from chronic diseases with significant\nunmet medical needs, including degenerative disc disease, multiple sclerosis, wound healing, and certain cancers, and potential extension of life applications including thymic\nand splenic involution reversal.\nWe were formed in April 2021 as a Texas limited liability company under the name FibroBiologics, LLC, and converted to a Delaware corporation in December 2021 under the\nname Fibrobiologics, Inc. On April 14, 2023, we changed our name to FibroBiologics, Inc. In connection with our formation, we issued shares of our Series A Preferred Stock,\nor the Series A Preferred Stock, to our then parent, FibroGenesis, in return for rights to certain intellectual property through a patent assignment agreement and an intellectual\nproperty cross-licensing agreement. Developing the intellectual property obtained from FibroGenesis was the basis for our formation. Prior to our inception, preclinical research\nand development related to the aforementioned disease pathways took place under FibroGenesis.\nFibroblasts Technology Platform\nFibroblasts and stem cells are the only two cell types in the human body that can regenerate tissue and organs. Studies have indicated that mesenchymal stem cells and\nfibroblasts share many surface markers in common, and can differentiate into many cells including adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, hepatocytes, and cardiomyocytes, and\ncan regulate the immune system. However, transcriptomic and epigenetic studies have indicated a clear difference between the two cell types.\nFibroblasts comprise the main cell type of connective tissue, possessing a spindle-shaped morphology, whose classical function has historically been believed to produce an\nextracellular matrix responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of the tissue. Fibroblasts also play an important role in the proliferative phase of wound healing,\nresulting in the deposition of the extracellular matrix.\nFibroblasts are favorable to stem cells as a cell therapy treatment platform because fibroblasts:\n● can be non-invasively harvested from a variety of skin donors from surgical procedures such as tummy tuck flaps;\n● have a faster doubling time in culture than stem cells;\n● possess superior immune modulatory activity compared with stem cells;\n● exhibit enhanced ability to produce regenerative cytokines and growth factors compared with stem cells; and\n● are more economical to isolate, culture and expand compared with stem cells because fibroblasts do not require the use of expensive tissue culture media.\nStudies have demonstrated that allogeneic fibroblasts, much like mesenchymal stem cells, are immune-privileged and do not provoke an immune response in vitro and in vivo.\nThese studies include that of Valente and colleagues (PMID 7646145) in which they looked at the aortic valve after heart transplantation and noted that even acute cases of\nacute myocardial rejection did not appear to compromise the long-term viability and durability of the valve, and the tissue viability was histologically confirmed and showed\nperfectly preserved fibroblasts1. In another study by O’Brien and colleagues (PMID 3682851) the researchers illustrated, using chromosomal analysis, long-term viability of the\nmale donor fibroblast cells from a valve leaflet removed nine years after implantation into a female recipient. This illustrated that donor fibroblast cells are able to survive and\nproliferate in the host with destruction by the immune system2. If autologous fibroblasts were required instead, it would mean that cells would have to be harvested from each\npatient, processed and cultured, and then administered to the same patient, which would be more costly and inefficient. Because allogeneic fibroblasts do not cause an immune\nresponse, we are planning to build our own cGMP manufacturing facility to source allogeneic fibroblast cells for clinical testing of our product candidates and for commercial\nsales if product candidates receive marketing approval.\n1\nOur Strategy\nWe are leveraging fibroblast cells as a technology platform to research and develop innovative treatments for chronic diseases with significant unmet treatment needs. Our\nvision is to become a world leader in regenerative medicine through a rigorous scientific process and commitment to serving patients’ needs. To achieve our vision, we will\nfocus our efforts on the following strategy:\n● Attract and retain scientists with the skill sets required to conduct preclinical studies and identify the optimal paths forward to clinical trials.\n● Prioritize our initial clinical development efforts on product candidates with the combination of significant unmet treatment needs, lower risk and market potential.\n● Partner with Clinical Research Organizations, or CROs, with the relevant expertise and experience to successfully and timely execute clinical trials to generate reliable\npivotal data that can be used to seek approvals.\n● Invest in critical capabilities required to produce and supply fibroblasts for clinical trials and initial commercialization.\n● Protect, expand and defend our intellectual property portfolio around fibroblasts.\n● Expand development efforts in product candidates with longer development timelines, greater risk and significant unmet treatment needs as funding allows.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $9.2 million. To advance our aforementioned strategy over the next 12 months, in addition to\nongoing expenditures for personnel and infrastructure, the following research and development initiatives are expected to be funded with available capital:\n● Approximately $0.1 million to $0.2 million in capital expenditures for laboratory equipment to enable continued research and expand capabilities;\n● Approximately $0.3 million to $0.4 million to acquire clinical skin samples;\n● Approximately $0.2 million to $0.3 million for tissue and fibroblast cell characterization and optimization;\n● Approximately $0.2 million to $0.4 million to develop a master cell bank;\n● Approximately $0.1 million to $0.3 million to develop a working cell bank;\n● Approximately $0.1 million to $0.3 million to develop processes for transfer to a CDMO;\n● Approximately $0.1 million to submit an IND application for CYWC628 for a phase 1/2 clinical trial in wound healing;\n● Approximately $0.2 million to $0.3 million to complete a preclinical animal study to determine mode of action for CYMS101 in MS prior to submitting an IND\napplication for a phase 1/2 clinical trial in MS; and\n● Approximately $0.1 million to initiate a preclinical animal study in CYTER915 for thymic involution reversal.\nWe believe our available capital will allow us to develop the master cell bank, and working cell bank for transfer to a CDMO that will ultimately manufacture our drug products\nrequired to initiate phase 1/2 clinical trials for CybroCell, CYMS101, and CYWC628.\nThe above estimates are preliminary and subject to change. We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for our available capital within the next 12 months. Due to\nuncertainties inherent in the development process, it is difficult to estimate the exact amounts of our available capital that will be used for any particular purpose. In addition,\nthe amount, allocation and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the results of our research and development efforts.\n2\nOur People\nWe have assembled an executive leadership team comprised of our founder, chief executive officer and chairperson of our board of directors, our chief scientific officer, and our\nchief financial officer, with successful track records in startup entrepreneurial companies and in the life sciences industry. Our executive leadership team works under the\noversight of our board of directors who are recognized leaders with hands-on industry experience. We also have a team of world-renowned scientists with relevant expertise on\nour scientific advisory board to help guide our research and development efforts.\nOur Current Pipeline\nWe have a pipeline of product candidates at various stages of development, including the following:\nCybroCellTM for Degenerative Disc Disease\nDegenerative Disc Disease\nBack pain is strongly associated with degeneration of the intervertebral disc. Disc degeneration, although in many cases asymptomatic, is also associated with sciatica and disc\nherniation, pain or prolapse. It alters disc height and the mechanics of the rest of the spinal column, adversely affecting the behavior of other spinal structures such as muscles\nand ligaments. In the long term, it can lead to spinal stenosis, a major cause of pain and disability in the elderly. Its incidence is rising with current demographic changes and an\nincreased aged population.\nThe disc acts as a joint between two vertebra and performs the following critical functions:\n● absorbs shock;\n● maintains motion; and\n● keeps stability.\n3\nDiscs degenerate far earlier than do other musculoskeletal tissues. The first unequivocal findings of degeneration in the lumbar discs are seen in the age group 11–16 years.\nAbout 20% of people in their teens have discs with mild signs of degeneration. The percentage increases sharply with age, particularly in males, so that around 10% of 50-year-\nold discs and 60% of 70-year-old discs are severely degenerated (Current Epidemiology of Low Back Pain” by Mattiuzzi et al, in 2020).\nDuring growth and skeletal maturation, the boundary between annulus and nucleus becomes less obvious and, with increasing age, the nucleus generally becomes more fibrotic\nand less gel-like. With increasing age and degeneration, the disc changes in morphology, becoming more and more disorganized. Often, the annular lamellae becomes irregular,\nbifurcating and interdigitating, and the collagen and elastin networks also appear to become more disorganized.\nCleft formation with fissures frequently forms within the disc, particularly in the nucleus. Nerves and blood vessels are increasingly found with degeneration. Cell proliferation\noccurs, leading to cluster formation in the nucleus. Cell death also occurs, with the presence of cells with necrotic and apoptotic appearance. It has been reported that more than\n50% of cells in adult discs are necrotic. With increasing age comes an increased incidence of degenerative changes, including cell death, cell proliferation, mucous\ndegeneration, granular change and concentric tears. It is difficult to differentiate changes that occur solely due to aging from those that might be considered ‘pathological’.\nAccording to research published in the Global Spine Journal, titled “Degenerative Lumbar Spine Disease: Estimating Global Incidence and Worldwide” by Ravindra et al\npublished in 2018, approximately 266.0 million individuals suffer from degenerative spinal disease and lower back pain each year. In addition, 403.0 million individuals present\nannually with symptomatic disc degeneration, 103.0 million with spinal stenosis and 39.0 million with spondylolisthesis. Furthermore, lower back pain is considered as one of\nthe chief complaints that may indicate an underlying spine-related disorder. According to the research published in the Journal of Hospital Management and Health Policy, titled\n“Current Epidemiology of Low Back Pain” by Mattiuzzi et al, in 2020, incidence, prevalence and disability-adjusted life years, or DALYs, of lower back pain are 245.9 million\ncases per year (15th worldwide cause), 577.0 million cases (15th worldwide cause) and 64.9 million (6th worldwide cause), respectively. The paper further stated that the risk\nof lower back pain is marginally higher in women compared to men. Chronic lower back pain is one of the common complaints that may indicate an underlying serious spinal\ndisorder.\nThese statistics indicate the significant impact degenerative spine disorders can have on patients’ lives. These indications are associated with a diverse range of clinical\nsymptoms such as weakness, low extremity pain and back pain, and can result in a significant reduction in the quality of life. The treatments used presently are mainly\nconservative and palliative and are aimed at returning patients to work. They range from bed rest (no longer recommended) to analgesia, the use of muscle relaxants or injection\nof corticosteroids, or local anesthetic and manipulation therapies. Various interventions (e.g. intradiscal electrotherapy) are also used, but despite anecdotal statements of\nsuccess, trials thus far have found their use to be of little direct benefit. Disc degeneration-related pain may also be treated surgically either by artificial disc replacement or by\nimmobilization of the affected vertebrae.\nAvailable Treatments for Degenerative Disc Disease\nMost patients suffering from degenerative disc disease, at least initially, show improvement with non-surgical interventions such as physical therapy, core strengthening, and\nstretching. When those interventions no longer provide relief, patients typically use therapeutics, which include conventional drugs such as opioids, non-steroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids for pain relief. When these non-surgical therapeutics are no longer effective, patients may undergo surgical treatment, including the use\nof medical devices or implants, to provide relief.\nThe original surgical treatment for correcting degenerated disc is either to perform a discectomy or spinal fusion. Discectomy is an appropriate procedure and is routinely\nperformed to remove the degenerated nucleus through a fenestration within the annulus. It allows removal of both the extruded nucleus (herniectomy) and the degenerated\nremaining inter-vertebral nucleus fragments. Although this procedure is ideal for decompressing and relieving the nervous system (root or cauda equina), it is a poor operation\nfor the spine, due to its resulting disabling condition which leads to a degenerative cascade and may require an additional invasive surgical procedure, like fusion or\narthroplasty. Discectomy brings a good short-term effect in relieving radicular pain, but it causes disc height reduction with neuro-foramen stenosis, instability of the treated\nlevel, poor result on back pain, and/or complications, such as spinal stenosis or facet pain.\n4\nPatients who undergo these procedures are usually on painkillers for weeks and have at least three to six months of recovery time. Therefore, there is a need for a less painful,\nless invasive and more effective method. The pitfalls of original treatment procedures have led to a search for the development of non-fusion technologies, such as disc or disc\nnucleus prosthesis. Disc arthroplasty with an artificial disc is an emerging treatment for patients with disc degeneration. Its advantages are to maintain motion, decrease\nincidence of adjacent segment degeneration, avoid complications related to fusion and allow early return to function. Currently, two kinds of devices are marketed: the total disc\nreplacement and the nuclear replacement. However, both of these devices have major pitfalls.\nThere has been a growing demand for spinal artificial discs in the market globally. These devices are gaining popularity as they are designed with the intent to provide\nstabilization and eliminate pain while preserving motion of the functional spinal unit. In July 2021, Aesculap Implant Systems, LLC announced the long-term reporting from its\npivotal trial for the activL® Artificial Disc.\nCentinel Spine’s prodiscL is a Total Disc Replacement, or TDR, technology platform that offers a surgical alternative to fusion to qualified patients suffering from disc\ndegeneration in the cervical and lumbar spine. ProdiscL implants are intended to relieve pain while allowing the potential for motion at the diseased spinal segment.\nThe activL Artificial Disc for one-level lumbar use is a weight-bearing modular implant consisting of two endplates and one polyethylene inlay and is intended as an alternative\nto fusion. It’s designed to allow controlled motion at the surgery level.\nTotal disc replacement is a bulky metallic prosthesis designed to replace the entire disc: annulus, nucleus and endplates. These prostheses use an invasive anterior (trans- or\nretro-peritoneal) approach that requires the presence of a vascular surgeon. Dislodgements, wear debris, degeneration of adjacent intervertebral discs, facet joint arthrosis and\nsubsidence of this type of prosthesis have been reported. The artificial nucleus substitute preserves the remaining disc tissues and their functions. Its design allows its\nimplantation through a posterior approach, but the major limitation of such nucleus prosthesis is that it can be used only in patients in whom disc degeneration is at an early or\nintermediate stage, because it requires the presence of a competent natural annulus. As a hydrogel-based device, it is fragile, and so does not resist the outstanding\nbiomechanical constraints of the lumbar spine (shear forces). As inert materials, they may lose their mechanical properties over time, and tears and breakages have been\nreported. Replacing the nucleus only and leaving in place a damaged annulus generates the conditions for implant extrusion or recidivism of discal herniation.\n5\nIn addition to disc replacements, there are current treatment options for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, which represent new options for the treatment of\ndegenerative disc disease. A variety of approaches are used to regenerate tissues. These approaches can be categorized into the following three groups:\n(i) Biomaterials, without additional cells, that are used to send signals to attract cells and promote regeneration;\n(ii) Cells alone may be used, to form a tissue; and\n(iii)Cells may be used with a biomaterial scaffold that acts as a frame for developing tissues.\nWhile Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation, or ACT, has been used for a few years to repair articular cartilage, tissue engineering for disc repair remains in its infancy.\nIntensive research is currently underway, and animal studies have shown the feasibility of tissue-engineered intervertebral disc. Typically, articular cartilage is a tissue that is\nnot naturally regenerated once damaged. Recently, efforts have been made to reconstruct damaged biological tissues by regenerating a portion of the damaged tissues in\nlaboratories. This approach, defined as “tissue engineering,” has received tremendous attention.\nTissue engineering involves the development of biocompatible materials capable of specifically interacting with biological tissues to produce functional tissue equivalents.\nTissue engineering has a basic concept of collecting a desired tissue from a patient, isolating cells from the tissue specimen, proliferating cells, seeding the proliferated cells\nonto a biodegradable polymeric scaffold, culturing the cells for a predetermined period in vitro, and transplanting back the cell/polymer construct into the patient. More\ninterestingly, recent pilot clinical trials have shown that ACT is an efficient treatment of herniated disc. The main disadvantage of ACT for disc repair is that it requires a disc\nbiopsy. Therefore, there is a need for an improved method to restore disc anatomy and improve its functioning, and there remains a need for an improved method of cartilage\nrepair.\nOur Solution\nCybroCell™ is an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy for degenerative disc disease This new technology is being designed as an alternative method for repairing the\ncartilage of the intervertebral disc (or any other articular cartilage). The method is based on using Human Dermal Fibroblasts, or HDFs, which are forced to differentiate into\nchondrocyte-like cells in vivo using the mechanical force and intermittent hydrostatic pressure found in the spine, for chondrogenic differentiation of fibroblasts. We believe our\nsolution will prove superior to existing treatments because it is less invasive, regenerates the disc, restores function and reduces pain, without debilitating long-term effects. We\nreceived IND clearance from the FDA on November 7, 2018, with an IND number of 18151. The trial is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of CybroCell™ administered\nthrough injection directly into a damaged intervertebral disc. The trial will enroll up to 15 participants with a primary outcome of safety and a secondary outcome of efficacy.\nSafety will be assessed as the occurrence/frequency of adverse events during the study procedures and for up to 12 months afterwards and will be recorded regardless of\nseverity or relatedness to treatment. Serious adverse events will be documented throughout the 12-month follow-up period. The incidence and nature of adverse events will be\ntabulated and analyzed at baseline, pre, and post procedure including the three, six, and 12-months evaluations. These include complete physical exam (including vital signs of\nblood pressure, temperature, and heart rate), laboratory determinations (including urinalysis, hematology, and biochemistry), review of medical history, review of medication\nhistory, Dallas pain questionnaire, and patient questionnaire (Oswestry Disability Index). Secondary efficacy outcome will assess subjective and objective parameters at three\nmonths, six months, and 12 months post CybroCell™ implantation and compare to those measured at baseline pre-implantation. These parameters will include visual analog\nscale, patient questionnaire (Oswestry Disability Index), Beck Depression Inventory, Dallas pain questionnaire, range of motion test, and radiological assessment using MRI to\nevaluate morphological changes to the treated discs.\n6\nWe are currently in the process of finalizing the experimental cell bank production which will be transferred to a contract development and manufacturing organization, or\nCDMO, for the manufacturing of the master cell bank and working cell bank per FDA requirements and will submit the necessary documentation to the FDA. Our quotes from\nthe CDMO for carrying out this work have been obtained.\nWe have completed two animal studies. Sixteen animals were used in the first pilot study (PMID 27853661) with the objective of determining the effects of intradiscal\ntransplantation of neonatal human dermal fibroblasts, or nHDFs, on intravertebral disc, or IVD, degeneration by measuring disc height, magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI,\nsignal intensity, gene expression, and collagen immunostaining. The results indicated that in the nHDF group there was a 10% increase in disk height index after eight weeks of\ntreatment with a p value of <.05, while there was no significant difference in the saline treated group. When compared with the saline treated group, discs treated with nHDFs\nshowed reduced expression of inflammatory markers, a higher ratio of collagen type II over collagen type I gene expression, and more intense immunohistochemical staining\nfor both collagen types I and II. In the second study (PMID 30142460) 38 animals were used with the objective of determining the impact of donor source on the therapeutic\neffect of dermal fibroblast treatment on disc degeneration and inflammation when comparing rabbit dermal fibroblasts, or RDFs, to nHDFs. Eight weeks after treatment, disc\nheight indexes of discs treated with nHDF increased significantly by 7.8% (p<.01), whereas those treated with saline or RDF increased by 1.5% and 2.0%, respectively. Gene\nexpression analysis showed that discs transplanted with nHDFs and RDFs displayed similar inflammatory responses (p=.2 to .8). Compared to intact discs, expression of both\ncollagen types I and II increased significantly in nHDF-treated discs (p<.05), trending to significant in RDF-treated discs, and not significantly in saline treated discs. The ratio\nof collagen type II/collagen type I was higher in the IVDs treated with nHDFs (1.26) than those treated with RDFs (0.81) or saline (0.59) and intact discs (1.00). Last,\nproteoglycan contents increased significantly in discs treated with nHDF (p<.05) and were trending toward significance in the RDF- treated discs compared to those treated\nwith saline. The results from the studies were positive and resulted in “first in human” trial approval. The technology allowed for differentiation of the HDFs into chondrocytes\nand the cells thrived in the spinal disc environment. The results showed the cells remained in the disc and did not migrate. Further, the cells created a biologic condition which\nappeared to increase the disc height.\nBelow is a summary of animal study results from Howard An, M.D., Director, Spine Fellowship Program, Rush University Medical College:\nOur studies have shown that this biological treatment using human dermal fibroblast cells, has great potential as a cell therapy for disc degeneration. When these cells were\ninjected into a degenerating rabbit disc, they were retained in the disc for up to 8 weeks. Collagen Type II gene expression, a marker for disc repair and regeneration, was higher\nin the discs treated with human dermal fibroblast cells than those in the control treatment. Also higher in the cell treated discs were the disc heights and cell number. Together,\nthis data suggests that human dermal fibroblast cells are a promising option for cell therapy to restore the biological function and reduce symptoms of intermediate or\nprogressive degenerative discs.\nWe have received IND clearance from the FDA, conditional upon approval of our master cell bank, to run a Phase 1/2 study for patients suffering from degenerative disc\ndisease and will be conducting this study within the United States. A timeline will be determined through discussions with the FDA.\nMarket Opportunity\nDegenerative disc disease therapeutics represents an approximately $26.0 billion1 per year market. In addition to therapeutics, degenerative disc disease results in\napproximately 1.2 million orthopedic surgeries per year, at a cost of approximately $60,000 to $100,000 each, in the United States alone. CybroCell™ could replace\ntherapeutics or defer many of these surgeries if it proves successful in regenerating disc cartilage and alleviating pain.\n1 Fortune Business Insights Report, “Degenerative Disc Disease Therapeutics: Global Market Analysis. Insights and Forecast 2022-2029,” p.13.\n7\nCYMS101 for Multiple Sclerosis\nMultiple Sclerosis\nMultiple sclerosis, or MS, has been characterized into four distinct clinical subtypes, differing in the age of onset, aggressiveness and progression of the disease, and frequency\nof relapses. Most MS cases (85%) follow a relapsing-remitting pattern, or RRMS, with an average relapse every 12 to 18 months in an untreated population, and short-term\nepisodes of neurologic deficits that resolve completely or almost completely. MS relapse is commonly defined as new or worsening symptoms that last 24 hours in duration and\noccur in the absence of fever or infection. Other patients may transition to a more aggressive disease form known as secondary progressive MS, or will experience steadily\nprogressive neurologic deterioration without relapses, known as primary progressive MS.\nThere is no primary indicator test for MS, but common testing for suspected MS involves MRI studies, evoked potentials testing, lumbar puncture/spinal tap, and other\nobjective functional tests.\nOnce a diagnosis of MS has been determined, ongoing periodic disability measurement testing will occur as a standard clinical practice. The first Disability Status Scale was\nintroduced by Kurtzke in 1955 and was later enhanced in 1983 into the Expanded Disability Status Scale, or EDSS. Over time, the EDSS has become the standard against\nwhich most MS clinical outcome measures are compared. Eight functional neurological systems are measured by the EDSS including vision, brainstem, pyramidal, cerebellar,\nsensory, bowel/bladder, mental/cerebral and ambulation (500m walk).\nOther disability measurement tests include the Scripps Neurological Rating Scale, which is an overall neurological assessment; the Nine-Hole Pin Test, which measures arm\nfunction; and the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, which measures ambulation function. The RAND 36-Question Health Survey may also be used, which is a general Quality of Life\nsurvey utilized by managed care organizations and by Medicare for routine monitoring and assessment of care outcomes in adult patients.\nAvailable Treatments for MS\nThere is no known cure for MS. Treatments available for MS include steroids for temporary flare-ups, disease-modifying drugs, and drugs that target specific symptoms such as\nbalance, vision, spasticity, sexual dysfunction, and bladder or bowel control. The mechanism of action of current MS disease-modifying drugs is to block the host’s immune-\nmediated attacks on the nerves to inhibit or minimize the progressive destruction of myelin. While these drugs may reduce the frequency of exacerbations and slow the disease\nprogression from inducing further nerve damage, there is no myelin or nerve regenerative capability in any of them to restore the cumulative damage already in place.\nAdditionally, as the disease progresses further, the ability for any of these drugs to effectively block immune-mediated myelin or nerve destruction becomes more blunted. Most\nMS drugs come with identified risks and side effects, including “black box” warnings.\nKey companies providing existing MS treatments include:\n● Biogen, Inc.: Strong presence in the global market coupled with a diverse portfolio of MS drugs;\n● F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (commonly known as Roche): Strong focus on research and development activities to develop novel medicine for MS treatment; and\n● Novartis AG: Increased focus on investment in research and development of innovative molecules.\nNew Treatments Being Developed\nResearch and development in the neurological therapy area has always been active. Various novel molecules are being investigated for the treatment of MS. Some of the key\npharmaceutical players are emphasizing the improvement of the disabilities associated with MS. The pipeline portfolios of various companies include agents with different\nmechanisms of action, which are expected to boost their demand from physicians, aiming to change the treatment algorithm in the coming years.\n8\nFor a decade, various companies such as Sanofi, Johnson & Johnson, and Novartis AG, among others, have been investing in the treatment for MS to bring novel therapeutics\nwith high efficacy and potency for patients. These companies have recently launched therapeutics intended for the most prevalent form of MS. In August 2020, the FDA\napproved Novartis AG’s Kesimpta, the only self-administered, targeted B-cell therapy for patients with relapsing MS, and in March 2021, Johnson & Johnson received FDA\napproval for the launch of Ponvory as a daily oral drug for treatment against MS.\nThe cost, outcome and quality of drugs approved is a priority of physicians as well as patients. Physicians play an important role in developing an interdisciplinary approach for\nthe management of MS, which is a key cause for manufacturers to focus on novel molecules with different mechanisms of action. For instance, TG Therapeutics, Inc.’s\nublituximab was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active\nsecondary progressive disease, in adults.\nThe approval and commercialization of these recently approved drugs for the treatment of symptoms associated with MS is expected to boost the MS drug market growth\nglobally in the near future.\nOur Solution\nWe are developing CYMS101 as an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy to treat MS. After completing animal studies using CYMS101 (allogeneic fibroblast cells), we\nreceived approval from Mexico for the conduct of clinical investigations using the fibroblast cell composition for patients with MS, and have completed the Phase 1 study\ncalled “Feasibility Study of Tolerogenic Fibroblasts in Patients with Refractory Multiple Sclerosis.” The study was conducted in five participants. The primary objective of the\nstudy was to assess safety, and the secondary objective was to assess efficacy. The results of the study for safety were no adverse effects during intravenous injection of the\ntolerogenic fibroblasts, no short or long-impact in complete blood count test during the 16-week monitoring period, and no short or long impact in electrocardiogram results\nduring the 16-week monitoring period. In addition, the results of the study for efficacy included:\n● Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). The test was developed by Gronwell in 1977 and later adapted by Rao in 1989 for use in MS. The test is a measure of\ncognitive function that assesses auditory information processing speed as well as calculation ability. In the test, single digits are presented every 3 seconds and the\npatient must add each new digit to the one immediately prior to it. Scoring is the total number of correct responses out of 60 possible. There was a general\nimprovement in PASAT score for all patients during the 16-week monitoring period.\n● Nine-Hole Peg Test. This is a standardized quantitative test of upper extremity function. The test is the most frequently used measure of upper extremity function in\nMS. In the test, dominant and non-dominant hands are tested twice. In the test, pegs are picked up one at a time and placed in one of nine holes. Once all nine pegs are\nplaced, the patient then removes the pegs one at a time and places them back in the container. Scoring is the time required to place pegs in holes and then remove the\npegs from holes. General improvement of Nine-Hole Peg Test completion time for all patients during the 16-week testing period was noted.\n9\n● Timed 25-Foot Walk Test. The test is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test. In the test, the patient is instructed to walk a 25 feet long path quickly\nbut safely. The test is administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. The score of the test is the average time of the two completed walks. No\ngeneral improvement or deterioration was noted with the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test.\n● Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). The test is used to quantify disability in MS and monitor changes in the level of disability over time. EDSS is widely used in\nclinical trials for assessment of participants with MS. The scale is based on neurological examination and impact on functional systems representing the network of\nneurons in the brain. EDSS scoring can vary widely due to complex scoring rules and subjective nature of the neurological testing. No general improvement or\ndeterioration was noted with EDSS test, and no patient exhibited further deterioration during the study.\n10\nAlthough determining the mode of action is not necessary for filing for FDA approval (Brown and Wobst, 2020), and to date between 10-20% of approved drugs have no\nknown mode of action determined (Moffat et al., 2017), we are currently conducting further research to determine the mode of action of fibroblasts in oligodendrocyte\nexpansion. We will file an IND application for a Phase 2 clinical trial in MS in the United States. While determining the mode of action will be optimal, having a general sense\nof possible mode of action will have a tangible benefit in the development, optimization and mitigation of possible side-effects. We will likely seek a strategic partner to\ncollaborate with us on the development of CYMS101 either before initiating the Phase 2 study, or after its completion, if successful, and prior to commencing with a Phase 3\nclinical trial.\nMarket Opportunity\nThe MS drug market’s annual revenue is presently approximately $24.0 billion2 globally, with 48% of the revenues generated in the United States. The key companies in this\nmarket include Biogen Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Sanofi, and Novartis AG. While there are more than 20 approved treatments, most of them have serious adverse effects\nand there are presently no cures. Both private and public organizations are increasing their investments in search of better treatments for this complex disease, including\ntreatments that restore lost function, and government initiatives to improve access to MS drugs in developing economies are another driver of future growth in the MS market.\nCYWC628 for Wound Healing\nWound Care/Healing\nA chronic wound is one that is usually arrested in the inflammatory stage and cannot progress to the proliferative and remodeling phase of healing. Proinflammatory cytokines\nproduced by necrotic tissue, foreign material and bacteria allow the inflammatory stage to continue. In addition, changes in the cellular deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA,\nsynthesis leads to increased formation of metalloproteases that impede the body’s attempt to heal by overwhelming the building blocks—chemotactant factors, growth factors\nand mitogens—needed for normal wound healing. Fibroblasts, an essential cell in the wound healing process, is epigenetically altered in the setting of chronic wounds so that\ntheir ability to replicate as well as produce the necessary building blocks for the formation of granulation tissue is altered. Further, the keratinocytes at the periphery of the\nwounds are phenotypically different so that while being able to proliferate, they cannot fully differentiate into migrating keratinocytes. This explains the epithelial build up\noften seen around the edge of the wound.\nDiabetic foot ulcers are the most prominent type of chronic wounds. The rising prevalence of chronic diseases globally, is leading to increased incidence of chronic wounds,\nincluding diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers and venous leg ulcers. These chronic wounds, especially late-stage “hard-to-heal ulcers,” exert a huge economic cost burden on\nhealthcare agencies globally. Furthermore, over 50% of diabetic foot ulcers become infected, which raises the risk of hospitalization, amputation and death.\n2 Fortune Business Insight Report, “Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: Global Market Analysis, Insights and Forecast, 2022-2029,” p.13.\n11\nAvailable Wound Care Treatments\nSeveral treatments are presently available for treatment of chronic wounds, including Apligraf, Grafix, DermACELL and TheraSkin. Apligraf is comprised of neonatal\nkeratinocytes, and neonatal fibroblasts within a bovine collagen matrix, and may be used to treat venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers. Grafix is a cryopreserved human\nplacental membrane that may be used as a wound cover, wrap and/or barrier to treat acute and chronic wounds, diabetic ulcers, pressure injuries, surgical wounds, burns and\nvenous ulcers. DermACELL is a technologically advanced dermal matrix comprised of intact cellular matrix that has at least 97% of DNA removed and may be used in the\ntreatment of chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers. TheraSkin is a cryopreserved human skin allograft with both epidermis and dermis layers that may be used to promote\nwound healing.\nNew Treatments Being Developed\nIncreasing application of bioactive therapies like skin grafting and growth factors in urgent treatment of wounds like diabetic foot ulcers is resulting in high investment of\nmarket players in research and development of these therapies. Accordingly, the rise in adoption rate of advance bioactive therapies for rapid wound healing is expected to\npropel the growth of wound care market. For example, in February 2021, Axio Biosolutions Private Limited received CE mark from Europe for its MaxioCel advanced wound\ncare product. The bioactive microfiber gelling technology helps wounds heal quickly.\nDistinct clinical benefits offered by negative pressure wound therapy, or NPWT, coupled with introduction of new advanced features such as single use and portability, among\nothers, for effective wound care is boosting the demand for NPWT devices from healthcare professionals globally. In January 2021, Smith & Nephew plc published that its\nPICO single-use negative pressure wound therapy system significantly reduced surgical site infections by 63.0% and dehiscence by 30.0%. In January 2019, Applied Tissue\nTechnologies LLC received FDA approval for its Platform Wound Dressing, NPWT device that eliminates the use of foam or gauze dressings. In April 2019, PolarityTE, Inc.\nlaunched clinical trials for its SkinTE regenerative tissue product for chronic wounds. The trials will evaluate SkinTE’s effectiveness in treating diabetic foot ulcers and venous\nleg ulcers.\nMoreover, new players are entering the wound care market by focusing on allograft, xenograft, nanofibre, dermal substitutes and cell-based therapies to cater the unmet needs\nand growing demand for urgent and effective treatment among patients.\nOur Solution\nWe are in the early stages of developing CYWC628 as an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy for wound healing. Our studies are presently focused on utilizing fibroblasts\nand fibroblast-derived cells to treat wounds in diabetic mice and rats. Based upon our results achieved to date, we plan to pursue an IND submission with the FDA for wound\nhealing as early as 2024.\nMarket Opportunity\nThe wound care market size was valued at approximately $17.0 billion3 globally in 2021, with more than half of the revenue generated in the United States and Europe, and,\naccording to Fortune Business Insights published in March 2022, was projected to grow to approximately $28.0 billion by 2029. The rising prevalence of chronic diseases\nglobally is leading to increased incidence of chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers and venous leg ulcers. The huge economic cost burden exerted by\nchronic and acute wounds has led to an increase in initiatives being undertaken by governments globally, to create awareness among the general population for early diagnosis\nof wounds. These initiatives, along with improving reimbursement policies for wound care in these countries, are anticipated to drive the adoption of wound care products and\nlead to continued growth in this market.\n3Fortune Business Insights, “Wound Care: Global Market Analysis, Insights and Forecast, 2022-2029,” p. 26.\n12\nOur Early-Stage Research\nCYTER915 for Extension of Life\nExtension of Life\nFibroblasts are no longer considered as mere structural components of organs but as dynamic participants in immune processes. Fibroblasts produce an environment that\ninfluences regulatory T cell migration, proliferation and activity, to ensure immunotolerance.\nOne of the key organs of the immune system is the thymus. It serves a vital role in T cell maturation and selection, elimination of self-reactive cells, establishment of central\ntolerance and T cell migration to recognize a wide range of pathogens. A variety of cells have been identified inside the thymus. These include epithelial cells, thymocytes,\ndendritic cells, or DC, macrophages, B lymphocytes, myoid cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. With age, the thymus declines in functionality through a process referred to\nas thymus or thymic involution. Publications have indicated that the process of involution enhances regulatory T cell generation which leads to increased susceptibility to\npathogen infections, tumors and autoimmune diseases.\nThe thymus is critically important to the immune system, which serves as the body’s defense mechanism providing surveillance and protection against diverse pathogens,\ntumors, antigens and mediators of tissue damage. The immune system comprises a complex network of cellular and molecular components subdivided into thymus-independent\n(innate) and thymus-dependent (adaptive) arms which function synergistically in all immune responses. Innate immunity constitutes the first line of defense and is mediated by\ninnate immune cells such as tissue macrophages, DC and granulocytes which elicit their effector function within minutes to hours following antigen exposure. Innate cells\nbecome activated via germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors, including toll like receptors and nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptors, which recognize\ninvariant features of pathogens (pathogen-associate molecular patterns) and tissue damage.\nOnce activated, innate cells such as macrophages and neutrophils can effectively clear antigens via phagocytosis. Other types of innate cells, such as DC, take up and process\nantigens, resulting in expression of antigenic epitopes in conjunction with their major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, or human leukocyte antigen molecules. These DC\ncan then serve as antigen-presenting cells for the priming of the adaptive immune system. In this way, the early innate response is coupled to, and facilitates, adaptive immunity.\nThe adaptive immune system consists of T and B lymphocytes which express specific antigen recognition receptors and develop highly specialized effector functions with the\nability to form long-term immunological memory. Both B cells and T cells develop from bone marrow-derived progenitors; while mature B cells are exported to the periphery\ndirectly from the bone marrow, T cell development, maturation and export require critical differentiation steps to occur in the thymus. Thymus-dependent T cell differentiation\nprocesses include expression of an antigen-specific cell surface T cell receptor through recombination of germline-encoded gene segments, and thymic “education” involving\nnegative selection of potentially self-reactive T cells and positive selection of T cells with the capacity to recognize antigens encountered in the periphery. These important\nthymic processes ensure that T cells can recognize antigens in the context of self-MHC, but do not elicit self-reactivity.\nThe spleen is one of the key secondary lymphoid organs responsible for the rapid response of the immune system to pathogens in the blood, and to maintain a long-term\nadaptive response to such pathogens. The spleen also serves as the key organ for iron metabolism and erythrocyte homeostasis. The organ also functions as a key storage site\nfor platelets and leukocytes. A variety of cells have been identified in the spleen, including endothelia cells, mesothelial cells, reticular cells, erythrocytes, granulocytes,\nmononuclear cells, hemopoietic cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, plasma cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and migrating B cells. With age, the structure and function of the\nspleen changes, leading to decreased ability to respond positively to vaccination, increased susceptibility to viral and bacterial pathogen infections, and increased incidence of\nautoimmune disease. Accordingly, there is a need for improving and extending the productive life of the thymus and spleen through cell therapy, which could lead to an\nextension of human life by defeating the diseases that are allowed to proliferate during the declining process of these vital glands.\nOur Solution\nOur research program is in the early stages and is being designed to regenerate or reinvigorate production of the thymus and/or spleen. The regeneration comprises\norganogenesis and/or T cell development, wherein the tissue is differentiated and/or expansion of epithelial cells uses activated or inactivated fibroblasts. In addition to\nfibroblasts, we anticipate using other agents such as nucleic acids, cytokines, chemokines, transcription factors, epigenetic factors, growth factors, hormones or a combination\nthereof. The population of cells may be activated in vitro or ex vivo. The next step in developing fibroblasts for thymic or splenic involution reversal will be to design and\nconduct preclinical studies to demonstrate whether thymic or splenic involution reversal can be achieved in animal models.\n13\nMarket Opportunity\nThe global anti-aging therapeutics market was estimated to have exceeded $500.0 million in 2021 and is expected to experience annual double-digit growth over the next ten\nyears as aging populations and standards of living are increasing globally. The demand for effective regenerative medicine solutions for the aging population is higher than ever.\nAs a result, anti-aging therapeutics are being developed by several companies using stem cells and regenerative medicine to identify, prevent, cure, and reverse age-related\ndysfunctions, illnesses, and diseases.\nCYPS317 for the Treatment of Psoriasis\nPsoriasis\nPsoriasis is a complex and chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that afflicts approximately 2% of the world population and affects primarily the skin, nails and joints.\nPsoriasis has a profound impact on the quality of life, leading to an increase in rate of anxiety and depression. The disease is also associated with a significant number of\ncomorbidities such arthritis, cardiometabolic disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and depression. Psoriasis\nmanifests as raised, red, scaly patches on the skin, which can appear on various parts of the body. Individuals with psoriasis have an increased risk of developing psoriatic\narthritis, along with metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities, which can have a significant impact on their overall health and quality of life.\nThe pathophysiology of psoriasis is complex, involving immune dysregulation, keratinocyte hyperproliferation, and immune cell infiltration into psoriatic lesions. As a result,\ntargeted therapies have been developed to modulate the immune response and reduce inflammation in individuals with psoriasis. While current biological therapies focusing on\nthe selective blockade of interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-23 signaling have shown significant efficacy in psoriasis treatment, they are accompanied by several challenges, including\nsignificant side effects, variable treatment responses, and diminished effectiveness over time. Consequently, cell therapy has emerged as a promising approach to psoriasis\nmanagement. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), derived from diverse sources, have demonstrated therapeutic potential in both psoriasis patients and animal models. Their\nimmunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties are believed to play pivotal roles. They have been shown to directly affect keratinocytes, T lymphocytes, macrophages,\nand dendritic cells (DCs), thereby reducing disease severity, immune cell infiltration, and cytokine production associated with psoriasis.\nOur Solution\nFibroblasts share phenotypic and functional properties with MSCs and are increasingly recognized as key players in immune modulation. In clinical settings, fibroblasts have\nbeen applied in wound care, effectively treating conditions such as diabetic foot ulcers and recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Their therapeutic potential has also been\nobserved in preclinical models of autoimmune diseases, including type I diabetes, alopecia areata, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis [. These findings shed light on the prospect of\nusing fibroblasts in psoriatic patients who do not respond to currently available therapies. As an effective immune modulator, fibroblasts have demonstrated their capacity to\nalleviate autoimmunity by stimulating regulatory T cells (Tregs) while suppressing pro-inflammatory Th17 cells, autoreactive T cells, and DC maturation. Consequently,\nfibroblasts may positively impact the onset and progression of autoimmune disease. Notably, fibroblasts offer a solution to scalability challenges often associated with MSC\ntherapy, rendering them a cost-effective alternative to MSCs, particularly for patients requiring long-term treatment and at risk of relapse.\nTCB190 for the Treatment of Certain Cancers\nOur research on certain cancers is just beginning and further information about the opportunity will be released as it becomes available.\nManufacturing and Supply\nWe currently produce our cell therapy product candidates at our laboratory facility in Houston, Texas. We are in the process of contracting with a CDMO for the transfer of our\nexperimental cell bank to produce our master cell bank, working cell bank and our fibroblast cell-based product candidate to enable clinical trials. If our product candidates\nreceive marketing approval, we will evaluate the longer-term feasibility of building our own cGMP manufacturing facility or continuing to outsource production to a CDMO\nfor clinical testing and commercial supply. We presently rely on third parties for certain portions of the cell therapy manufacturing process and will likely continue to do so in\nthe future.\nIntellectual Property\nWe were formed in April 2021 as a spinout from FibroGenesis. In connection with our formation, we issued the equivalent of 8,750,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to\nFibroGenesis in exchange for a patent assignment agreement, or the Patent Assignment Agreement, and an intellectual property cross-license agreement, or the Intellectual\nProperty Cross-License Agreement. The Patent Assignment Agreement transfers all right, title and interest to certain patents/applications from FibroGenesis to us, and the\nIntellectual Property Cross-License Agreement allocates between FibroGenesis and us, exclusive fields of use for both assigned and retained patents issued/pending.\nThrough the Patent Assignment Agreement and the Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreement, FibroGenesis has effectively granted to us exclusive rights to develop\nfibroblasts in the following fields of use:\n● diagnosis, treatment, prevention and palliation of spinal diseases, disorders or conditions;\n● certain cancers;\n● orthopedic diseases, disorders or conditions; and\n● multiple sclerosis.\nFibroGenesis has retained exclusive rights for all other fields of use for both issued patents and patent applications transferred to us or retained by FibroGenesis.\nThe issued patents and patent applications assigned to us, along with additional patent applications filed independently by us after inception, include, as of the date hereof, a\ntotal of 48 patents and 109 patent applications pending. Our patent protections for our issued patents generally expire in years ranging from 2027 to 2043.\nAll of our issued patents are covered by the Patent Assignment Agreement and consist of 10 issued patents in the United States, eight issued patents in Australia, four issued\npatents in Japan, four issued patents in the United Kingdom, three issued patents in France, three issued patents in Germany, three issued patents in Italy, three issued patents in\nSpain, three issued patents in Hong Kong, two issued patents in Canada, two issued patents in China, two issued patents in Switzerland, and the remaining issued patent in\nEurope. One of our issued patents is also covered by the Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreement, which patent was issued in the United States.\n14\nGiven present patent ineligibility laws concerning products of nature, there are presently no composition of matter patents covering CybroCell™, although there are patents\nrelated to the production of CybroCell™. We currently have patent applications pending for composition of matter for both CYMS101 and CYWC628.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our\nbusiness that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality\nagreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and partners. These agreements generally provide that all\nconfidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship.\nThese agreements also generally provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of\nemployment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security\nmeasures, to guard against misappropriation of our property.\nCompetition\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary and novel\nproducts and product candidates. Our competitors have developed, are developing or may develop products, product candidates and processes competitive with our product\ncandidates. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the\nfuture. We believe that a significant number of products are currently under development, and may become commercially available in the future, for the treatment of conditions\nfor which we may attempt to develop product candidates. In addition, our products may need to compete with off-label drugs used by physicians to treat the indications for\nwhich we seek approval. This may make it difficult for us to replace existing therapies with our products.\nWe are developing CybroCellTM for the treatment of degenerative disc disease. Our competitors in the market for degenerative disc disease include Aesculap Implant Systems,\nLLC, Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, DiscGenics, Inc., Spine BioPharma, Inc. and Ferring B.V. In July 2021, Aesculap Implant Systems, LLC announced the\nlong-term reporting from its pivotal trial for the activl® Artificial Disc.\nWe are developing CYMS101 as an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy to treat MS. Key companies currently providing MS treatments include Biogen, Inc., F. Hoffmann-\nLa Roche Ltd and Novartis AG. Various companies, such as Sanofi and Novartis AG, have been investing in the treatment for MS to bring novel therapeutics with high efficacy\nand potency for patients. These companies have recently launched therapeutics intended for the most prevalent form of MS. In August 2020, the FDA approved Novartis AG’s\nKesimpta, the only self-administered, targeted B-cell therapy for patients with relapsing MS, and in March 2021, Johnson & Johnson received FDA approval for the launch of\nPonvory as a daily oral drug for treatment against MS. TG Therapeutics, Inc.’s ublituximab for the indication of RMS was also recently approved by the FDA for treatment of\nMS.\nWe are in the early stages of developing CYWC628 as an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy for wound healing. We face competition from several treatments presently\navailable for treatment of chronic wounds, including Apligraf, Grafix, DermACELL and TheraSkin. In addition, increasing application of bioactive therapies like skin grafting\nand growth factors in urgent treatment of wounds like diabetic foot ulcers is resulting in high investment by companies in research and development of these therapies. In\nJanuary 2019, Applied Tissue Technologies LLC received FDA approval for its Platform Wound Dressing, NPWT device that eliminates the use of foam or gauze dressings. In\nApril 2019, PolarityTE, Inc. launched clinical trials for its SkinTE regenerative tissue product for chronic wounds. In January 2021, Smith & Nephew plc published that its\nPICO single-use negative pressure wound therapy system significantly reduced surgical site infections by 63.0% and the dehiscence by 30.0%, and in February 2021, Axio\nBiosolutions Private Limited received CE mark from Europe for its MaxioCel advanced wound care product, a bioactive microfiber gelling technology which helps wounds\nheal quickly.\n15\nMany of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources and\ncommercial expertise than we do. Large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, obtaining regulatory\napprovals, recruiting patients and manufacturing biotechnology products. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do and\nmay also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of development, and collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research\ninstitutions. Established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license\nnovel compounds that could make the product candidates that we develop obsolete. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in\neven more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly\nthrough collaborative arrangements with large and established companies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. As a result,\nour competitors may succeed in obtaining approval from the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities or in discovering, developing and\ncommercializing products in our field before we do. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that\nare safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe effects, are more convenient, have a broader label, are marketed more effectively, are reimbursed or are less expensive than\nany products that we may develop. Technological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our technologies or product candidates obsolete, less\ncompetitive or not economical. If we are unable to compete effectively, our opportunity to generate revenue from the sale of any products we may develop, if approved, could\nbe adversely affected.\nRegulatory Environment\nGovernment Regulation and Product Approval\nThe FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries and jurisdictions impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon\ncompanies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of products such as those we are developing. These entities regulate, among other\nthings, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion,\ndistribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, export and import of our product candidates. Any product candidates that we develop must be approved by the\nFDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in those foreign countries.\nGenerally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important\ndifferences.\nU.S. Product Development Process\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service\nAct and their implementing regulations. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent\ncompliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements\nat any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial\nsanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of\nletters, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or\ncivil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice or other governmental entities. In addition, an applicant may need to recall\na product. Additionally, certain of our product candidates are subject to regulation in the United States as a combination product. If marketed individually, each component\nwould be subject to different regulatory pathways and would require approval of independent marketing applications by the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned\nto a center within the FDA that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the\nsingle mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our CybroCell™ product candidate, we believe that the primary mode of action is\nattributable to the biologic component of the product. We expect to seek approval of this combination product candidate through a BLA, and we do not expect that the FDA will\nrequire a separate marketing authorization for each of the drug and biologic constituents of the product.\n16\nThe process required by the FDA before a new product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:\n● completion of nonclinical or preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP,\nrequirements and other applicable regulations;\n● submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;\n● approval by an IRB or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;\n● performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for\nits intended use, or with respect to biologics, the safety, purity and potency of the product candidate for each proposed indication;\n● submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA after completion of all pivotal trials;\n● a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review;\n● satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;\n● satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess\ncompliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of\nselected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs;\n● a potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and\n● the FDA’s review and approval of the NDA or BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.\nPreclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. The\nconduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies.\nPrior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA\nto administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical trials.\nSome preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics,\npharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support\nthe use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by\nthe FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical\nhold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not\nresult in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.\nIn addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the United States, certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic\nnucleic acid molecules are subject to oversight at the local level as set forth in the NIH Guidelines. Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer\ntrials includes evaluation and assessment by an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing\nrecombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the\nenvironment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being\nconducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies, and other institutions not\notherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.\n17\nClinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements,\nwhich include the requirement that all research subjects, or their legal representative, provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials\nare conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and\nthe effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and\nfor any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any\nclinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare\nand rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to\nanticipated benefits. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being\nexposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some clinical trials also include oversight by an independent group of qualified\nexperts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, which provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward\nat designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial and may recommend that the clinical trial be halted if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety\nrisk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to\npublic registries.\nHuman clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:\n● Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain cases such as certain cancers, patients with the target disease or\ncondition. These trials are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side\neffects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases,\nsuch as certain cancers, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often\nconducted in patients.\n● Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal\ndosages, dose tolerance and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain\ninformation prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.\n● Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical\nefficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall\nrisk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for physician labelling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical\ntrials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA.\nPost-marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional\nexperience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, such as with accelerated approval drugs, the FDA may mandate the\nperformance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval.\n18\nDuring the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end\nof Phase 2 clinical trials or before an NDA or BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share\ninformation about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors\ntypically use the meetings at the end of a Phase 2 clinical trial to discuss the clinical trial’s results and present plans for a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will\nsupport approval of their new drug.\nConcurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical\ncharacteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process\nmust be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity,\nstrength, quality and purity of the final product. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the\nproduct candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.\nWhile the IND is active and before product approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress\nreport must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected\nadverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a\nsignificant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator\nbrochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also\nmust notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.\nU.S. Review and Approval Process\nAssuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other\nnonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other\nrelevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials\nintended to test the safety and effectiveness of the use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing\napproval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.\nThe submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally,\nno user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.\nThe FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-\ncompliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in\neffect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity or BLA to review and act on the submission. This review\ntypically takes twelve months from the date the NDA or BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after the\napplication is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs or BLAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine\nwhether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event,\nthe NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.\nThe FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific\nexperts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the\nrecommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.\n19\nBefore approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it\ndetermines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required\nspecifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA\ndetermines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request\nadditional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy\nthe regulatory criteria for approval.\nAfter the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with\nprescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be\napproved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA and may require additional\nclinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or\nmanufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the\napplication. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.\nIf regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may contain limitations on the indicated uses for which such product\nmay be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA or BLA with a REMS to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to\nmanage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could\ninclude medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk\nminimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications.\nOnce approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product\nreaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more post-marketing studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness\nafter commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements,\nincluding those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise\nimpact ongoing development programs.\nOrphan Drug Designation\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than\n200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and\nmaking a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested\nbefore submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the\nFDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. Orphan designation entitles a party to\nfinancial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers.\nIf a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to\norphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven\nyears, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different\nproducts for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has\nexclusivity. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or\nif our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If an orphan designated product receives marketing\napproval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost\nif the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the\nneeds of patients with the rare disease or condition.\n20\nExpedited Development and Review Programs\nThe FDA has a number of programs intended to expedite the development or review of products that meet certain criteria. For example, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track\ndesignation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or\ncondition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has\nopportunities for more frequent interactions with the review team during product development, and the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling\nbasis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections\nof the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fee upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.\nA product, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as\npriority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative\ntherapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional\nresources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with\npriority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of standard NDAs or BLAs under its current PDUFA review goals.\nIn addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated\napproval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be\nmeasured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into\naccount the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor\nof a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of\npromotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.\nA product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development\nand review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product, alone or in combination with one or more other\ndrugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects\nobserved early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as\nearly as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.\nIn addition, the FDA may designate a product as a regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT. The RMAT designation is intended to facilitate an efficient development\nprogram for, and expedited review of, any product candidate that meets the following criteria: (i) the product candidate qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy,\ntherapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (ii) the product\ncandidate is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (iii) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product\ncandidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings\nwith the FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review of BLAs. Cell therapy candidates granted RMAT\ndesignation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance\nupon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites, as appropriate. RMAT-designated cell therapy candidates that receive\naccelerated approval may, as appropriate, fulfill their post-approval requirements through the completion of clinical trials, patient registries, or through submission of other\nsources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records, through the collection of larger confirmatory data sets, or via post-approval monitoring of all patients treated\nwith such therapy prior to approval of the therapy.\n21\nFast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, RMAT designation and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may\nexpedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no\nlonger meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nPost-Approval Requirements\nAny products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things,\nrequirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product.\nAfter approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are\ncontinuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA or BLA. Drug and biologic\nmanufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections\nby the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party\nmanufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being\nimplemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party\nmanufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain\ncompliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance.\nThe FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later\ndiscovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to\ncomply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to\nassess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program.\nOther potential consequences include, among other things:\n● restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;\n● fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;\n● clinical holds on clinical trials;\n● refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n● product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;\n● consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;\n● mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;\n● the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the\nproduct; or\n● injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\n22\nThe FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Newly discovered or developed\nsafety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the\nimplementation of other risk management measures.\nThe FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity\nand potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations\nprohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective\nadvertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are\nnot described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment\nfor many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s\ncommunications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper\npromotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter\ninto consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading\ninformation that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labeling.\nIn addition, the distribution of prescription biopharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs\nand drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the\ndistribution of prescription biopharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.\nBiosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are highly similar, or\n“biosimilar,” to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and\napproval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of\nsafety, purity, and potency, is generally shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to\nthe reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for\nproducts that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered\nwithout increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. A product shown to be biosimilar or interchangeable with an\nFDA-approved reference biological product may rely in part on the FDA’s previous determination of safety and effectiveness for the reference product for approval, which can\npotentially reduce the cost and time required to obtain approval to market the product.\nUnder the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by\nthe FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed.\nDuring this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing\nproduct containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product.\nThe BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed\n“interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.\n23\nA biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent\nterms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study\nin accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.\nData Privacy and Security\nOther federal legislation may affect our ability to obtain certain health information in conjunction with our research activities. We may be subject to data privacy and security\nregulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the\nHealth Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and its implementing regulations, collectively referred to as HIPAA, imposes obligations,\nincluding mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA also prohibits\nknowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representation, or making or\nusing any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment\nfor healthcare benefits, items or services. We may obtain health information from third parties, such as research institutions, that are subject to privacy and security\nrequirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could potentially be subject to\ncriminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a\nmanner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nIn addition, numerous federal and state laws and regulations that address privacy and data security, including state data breach notification laws, state health information\nprivacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of\nhealth-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability\nfor us, which could include civil and/or criminal penalties, private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our business.\nFailure to achieve and sustain compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws could result in government enforcement actions and create liability\nfor us, which could include civil and/or criminal penalties, private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nOther U.S. Regulatory Requirements\nBiopharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign\njurisdictions in which they conduct their business that may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and\ndistribute any products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and\ntransparency laws and regulations related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. If their operations are\nfound to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative,\ncivil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from\nparticipation in federal and state healthcare programs and responsible individuals may be subject to imprisonment.\nCoverage and Reimbursement\nSales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare\nprograms, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. In the United States, no uniform\npolicy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement levels for products can differ significantly from payor to\npayor. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement\npolicies for drugs and biologics. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is (i) a covered benefit under its health plan, (ii) safe,\neffective and medically necessary, (iii) appropriate for the specific patient, (iv) cost-effective and (v) neither experimental nor investigational. Decisions regarding the extent of\ncoverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical\nproducts, drugs and services. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult\nbecause of the higher prices often associated with such drugs.\n24\nIn addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on\ncoverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive\npolicies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a\nthird-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales.\nHealthcare Reform\nIn March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the\nbiopharmaceutical industry. The ACA contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and\nchanges to fraud and abuse laws. Additionally, the ACA:\n● increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price;\n● required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;\n● required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan\nBudget Act of 2018, effective as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their\ncoverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and\n● imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year.\nMoreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in\nseveral Congressional inquiries, proposed and enacted legislation and executive orders issued by the former Trump administration designed to, among other things, bring more\ntransparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for\ndrug products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing,\nincluding price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some\ncases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nInternational Regulation\nIn order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and\njurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products.\nWhether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can\ncommence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions.\n25\nThe regulation of our product candidates outside of the United States varies by country. Certain countries regulate human tissue products as a pharmaceutical product, which\nwould require us to make extensive filings and obtain regulatory approvals before selling our product candidates. Certain other countries classify our product candidates as\nhuman tissue for transplantation but may restrict its import or sale. Other countries may have no application regulations regarding the import or sale of products similar to our\nproduct candidates, creating uncertainty as to what standards we may be required to meet.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had ten full-time employees, including six employees with medical or doctoral degrees and eight employees directly engaged in research and\ndevelopment, with the rest providing administrative, business and operations support. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective\nbargaining agreements. We consider the relationship with our employees to be good.\nOur Facilities\nOur principal executive offices are located at 455 E. Medical Center Blvd., Suite 300, Houston, Texas, where we lease approximately 23,000 square feet of office space. The\nspace serves as the location of our corporate headquarters. The lease expires in April 2027. In addition, we have leased research labs and offices in Houston, Texas, for our\nresearch and cell manufacturing operations.\nWe believe that our facilities are adequate for our current and anticipated near-term needs and that suitable additional or substitute space would be available if needed.\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We are currently not a party to any material legal proceedings and, to the best of our\nknowledge, no material legal proceedings are currently pending or threatened. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and\nsettlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all other information included in this Annual\nReport. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to accomplish our strategic objectives could\nbe materially harmed. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described\nbelow are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations\nand the market price of our common stock. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See “Special Note Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain\nfactors, including those described below.\n26\nSummary of Risk Factors\n● The successful development of biopharmaceutical products is highly uncertain.\n● We have a limited operating history and none of our current product candidates have been approved for commercial sale, which may make it difficult for you to\nevaluate our current business and predict our future success and viability.\n● We have incurred significant net losses since inception, expect to continue to incur significant net losses for the foreseeable future, and may never achieve or maintain\nprofitability.\n● We will require substantial additional capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to raise such capital when needed, or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to\ndelay, reduce and/or eliminate one or more of our research and drug development programs or future commercialization efforts.\n● The regulatory approval processes of the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time\nconsuming and inherently unpredictable.\n● We may encounter substantial delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\n● The outcome of preclinical studies or early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and the results of our clinical trials may not satisfy\nthe requirements of the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\n● Interim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are\nsubject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\n● Our current or future product candidates may cause adverse events, toxicities or other undesirable side effects when used alone or in combination with other approved\nproducts or investigational new drugs that may result in a safety profile that could inhibit regulatory approval, prevent market acceptance, limit their commercial\npotential or result in significant negative consequences.\n● Even if approved, our product candidates may not achieve adequate market acceptance.\n● Our refrigerated product candidates require specific storage, handling and administration at the clinical sites.\n● We intend to identify and develop novel cell therapy product candidates, which makes it difficult to predict the time, cost and potential success of product candidate\ndevelopment.\n● Because cell therapy is novel and the regulatory landscape that governs any cell therapy product candidates we may develop is rigorous, complex, uncertain and\nsubject to change, we cannot predict the time and cost of obtaining regulatory approval, if we receive it at all, for any product candidates we may develop.\n● We may be unable to obtain U.S. or foreign regulatory approvals and, as a result, may be unable to commercialize our product candidates.\n● Any product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.\n● We have limited experience in designing clinical trials.\n● Our long-term prospects depend in part upon discovering, developing and commercializing additional product candidates, which may fail in development or suffer\ndelays that adversely affect their commercial viability.\n● We have never commercialized a fibroblast cell-based therapy product candidate before and may lack the necessary expertise, personnel and resources to successfully\ncommercialize any product candidates on our own or together with suitable collaborators.\n● We face significant competition.\n● If we are unable to establish sales or marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell or market our product candidates, we may not be able to\nsuccessfully sell or market our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval.\n● In order to successfully implement our plans and strategies, we will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this\ngrowth.\n● We are subject to risks related to our dependence on third parties (i) to conduct certain aspects of our preclinical studies and clinical trials and (ii) for certain portions\nof our manufacturing process.\n● We are highly dependent on our Houston, Texas facility and any failure to maintain the use of this facility would have a material and adverse effect on our business.\n● We are subject to extensive government regulations.\n● Our business entails a significant risk of product liability.\n● The FDA, the EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from trials conducted in locations outside of their jurisdiction.\n● Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they will be subject to significant post-marketing regulatory requirements and oversight.\n● Our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies, and we are subject to various risks relating to our intellectual\nproperty.\n● The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management\nand qualified board members.\n● We are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq Stock Market Rules because our insiders beneficially own more than 50% of the voting power of our\noutstanding voting securities.\n● We have 2,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock with super voting rights.\n● We have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting due to lack of segregation of duties.\n● An active trading market may not develop or continue to be liquid and the market price of our shares of common stock may be volatile.\n27\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nThe successful development of biopharmaceutical products is highly uncertain.\nSuccessful development of biopharmaceutical products is highly uncertain and is dependent on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Product candidates\nthat appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for several reasons, including:\n● clinical trial results showing the product candidates to be less effective than expected (for example, a clinical trial could fail to meet its primary or key secondary\nendpoint(s)) or have an unacceptable safety or tolerability profile;\n● failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals or a delay in receiving such approvals, which, among other things, may be caused by patients who fail the trial\nscreening process, slow enrollment in clinical trials, patients dropping out of trials, patients lost to follow-up, length of time to achieve trial endpoints, additional time\nrequirements for data analysis or NDA preparation, discussions with the FDA, an FDA request for additional preclinical or clinical data or unexpected safety or\nmanufacturing issues;\n● preclinical study results showing the product candidate to be less effective than desired or to have harmful side effects;\n● post-marketing approval requirements; or\n● the proprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies that may prevent our product candidates from being commercialized.\nThe length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly from\none product candidate to the next and from one country or jurisdiction to the next and may be difficult to predict.\nEven if we are successful in obtaining marketing approval, commercial success of approved products may also depend in large part on the availability of coverage and adequate\nreimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and managed care organizations in the United States or\ncountry-specific governmental organizations in foreign countries, which may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures designed to reduce the cost of\nhealthcare. Third-party payors could require us to conduct additional studies, including post-marketing studies related to the cost effectiveness of an approved product, to\nqualify for reimbursement, which could be costly and divert our resources. If government and other healthcare payors were to not provide coverage and adequate\nreimbursement for our products once approved, market acceptance and commercial success may be reduced.\nIn addition, if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, we will be subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding the submission of safety and other\npost-marketing information and reports and registration, and will need to continue to comply (or ensure that any third-party providers comply) with cGMPs and good clinical\npractices, or GCPs, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, there is always the risk that we, a regulatory authority or a third party might identify\npreviously unknown problems with a product post-approval, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency. Compliance with these requirements is costly, and\nany failure to comply or other issues with our product candidates post-approval could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a limited operating history and none of our current product candidates have been approved for commercial sale, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate\nour current business and predict our future success and viability.\n28\nBiopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We are a clinical-stage cell therapy company with a\nlimited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. None of our current product candidates are approved for commercial sale and we have not\ngenerated any revenue from such product candidates. To date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources and efforts to organizing and staffing our company, business\nplanning, executing partnerships, raising capital, discovering, identifying and developing potential product candidates, securing related intellectual property rights and\nconducting and planning preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. In relation to our current product candidates, we have not yet demonstrated our ability\nto successfully complete any Phase 3 clinical trials, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial-scale product or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or\nconduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. As a result, it may be more difficult for you to accurately predict our future success\nor viability than it could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing biopharmaceutical products.\nIn addition, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors and risks frequently experienced by clinical-stage\nbiopharmaceutical companies in rapidly evolving fields. We also may need to transition from a company with a research focus to a company capable of supporting commercial\nactivities. If we do not adequately address these risks and difficulties or successfully make such a transition, our business will suffer.\nWe have incurred significant net losses since inception, expect to continue to incur significant net losses for the foreseeable future, and may never achieve or maintain\nprofitability.\nWe have incurred significant net losses since our inception, have not generated any revenue from product sales to date and have financed our operations principally through\nprivate financings. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred net losses of $16.5 million, $5.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nwe had an accumulated deficit of $24.4 million and $7.9 million, respectively. Our losses have resulted principally from expenses incurred in research and development of our\nproduct candidates and from management and administrative costs and other expenses that we have incurred while building our business infrastructure. We expect that it will be\nseveral years, if ever, before we have a commercialized product and generate revenue from product sales. Even if we succeed in receiving marketing approval for, and\ncommercializing, one or more of our product candidates, we expect that we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenses as we discover,\ndevelop and market additional potential product candidates.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase substantially if and as we:\n● advance the development of our lead product candidates through clinical development, and, if approved by the FDA, commercialization;\n● advance our preclinical development programs into clinical development;\n● incur manufacturing costs for cell production to supply our product candidates;\n● seek regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n● increase our research and development activities to identify and develop new product candidates;\n● hire additional personnel;\n● expand our operational, financial and management systems;\n● meet the requirements and demands of being a public company;\n● invest in further development to protect and expand our intellectual property;\n● establish a sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval and\nintend to commercialize; and\n● expand our manufacturing and develop our commercialization efforts.\nThe net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from period to period, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of\nour future performance. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses\nand expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our working capital and our ability to achieve and maintain profitability.\n29\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue or execute other business development arrangements. We do not expect to generate\nsignificant revenue, if any, unless and until we are able to obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize, one or more product candidates we are developing or\nmay develop. Successful commercialization will require achievement of many key milestones, including demonstrating safety and efficacy in clinical trials, obtaining\nregulatory approval for these product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we may obtain regulatory approval, satisfying any post-\nmarketing requirements and obtaining reimbursement for our products from private insurance or government payors. Because of the uncertainties and risks associated with\nthese activities, we are unable to accurately and precisely predict the timing and amount of revenues, the extent of any further losses or if or when we might achieve\nprofitability.\nWe may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, we may never generate revenues that are significant enough for us to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve\nprofitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable could impair our ability to raise\ncapital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. If we continue to incur losses as we have since our inception, investors may not receive\nany return on their investment and may lose their entire investment.\nWe will require substantial additional capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to raise such capital when needed, or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to\ndelay, reduce and/or eliminate one or more of our research and drug development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nDeveloping biopharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a very time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years\nto complete. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception, and we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities,\nparticularly as we initiate and conduct clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for our current product candidates and any future product candidates. Even if one or more\nof the product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product\ncandidate. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA, the EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities to perform clinical trials or\npreclinical studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Other unanticipated costs may also arise. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product\ncandidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to drug sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Because the design and outcome of our\nanticipated clinical trials are highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of\nany product candidate we develop. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in order to maintain our continuing operations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $9.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. And subsequently raised approximately $1.9 million in February 2024. Based on\nour current business plans, we believe that our existing capital will enable us to fund our operations through at least February 28, 2025. Our estimate as to how long we expect\nour existing capital to be able to continue to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner\nthan we currently expect. Changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently\nanticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n● the initiation, progress, timeline, cost and results of our clinical trials for our product candidates;\n● the initiation, progress, timeline, cost and results of additional research and preclinical studies related to pipeline development and other research programs we initiate\nin the future;\n● the cost and timing of manufacturing activities, including our planned manufacturing scale-up activities associated with our product candidates and other programs as\nwe advance them through preclinical and clinical development through commercialization;\n● the potential expansion of our current development programs to seek new indications;\n● the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n30\n● the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, in-licensed or otherwise;\n● the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n● the payment of licensing fees, potential royalty payments and potential milestone payments;\n● the cost of general operating expenses;\n● the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval in regions where we\nchoose to commercialize our products on our own; and\n● the costs of operating as a public company.\nAdvancing the development of our product candidates will require a significant amount of capital. In order to fund all of the activities that are necessary to complete the\ndevelopment of our product candidates, we will be required to obtain further funding through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or\nother sources, which may dilute our stockholders or restrict our operating activities. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur failure to raise capital as and when needed or on acceptable terms would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy,\nand we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, suspend or eliminate one or more of our research-stage programs, clinical trials or future commercialization efforts, grant rights\nto develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves, obtain funds through arrangement with collaborators on terms\nunfavorable to us or pursue merger or acquisition strategies, all of which could adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates on\nunfavorable terms to us.\nWe may seek additional capital through a variety of means, including through equity, debt financings, or other sources, including up-front payments and milestone payments\nfrom strategic collaborations. We may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our\ncurrent or future operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted,\nand the terms may include liquidation or other preferences and anti-dilution protections that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder.\nSuch financing may also result in imposition of debt covenants, increased fixed payment obligations or other restrictions that may adversely affect our ability to conduct our\nbusiness. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to\nrelinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe are party to a share purchase agreement, dated November 12, 2021, with certain investors, or the Share Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we may elect to issue and\nsell to such investors, and if so elected, such investors will be obligated to purchase, for a period commencing on the first day on which our common stock trade on a principal\nU.S. securities exchange and ending 60 months from such date, up to $100,000,000 worth of shares of our common stock, or the Aggregate Limit. The Share Purchase\nAgreement is contingent upon our achieving a public listing of our common stock. Pursuant to the agreement, we are required to pay the investors a commitment fee equal to\n2% of the Aggregate Limit, payable in cash or shares of our common stock. The commitment fee is payable even if we do not utilize any drawdowns.\nIn addition, the agreement required us to issue to the investors, on our public listing date, a warrant to purchase up to the number of shares of our common stock that is equal to\n4% of our total equity interests outstanding immediately after the completion of our public listing, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the public offering price per share\n(in the case of an initial public offering) or the closing bid price per share on the public listing date (in the case of a public listing other than an initial public offering) or (ii) the\nquotient obtained by dividing $700,000,000 by the total number of equity interests.\n31\nOur election to issue and sell to the investors, shares of our common stock pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, or the exercise of the warrant we are issuing upon\nconsummation of our direct listing, will result in further dilution to our existing stockholders and investors who purchase shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA, the EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. If\nwe are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be unable to generate product revenue and our business will be substantially\nharmed.\nWe are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate in the United States without obtaining marketing approval from the FDA. Foreign\nregulatory authorities, such as the EMA, impose similar requirements. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA, the EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities is unpredictable, typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the type, complexity and\nnovelty of the product candidates involved. In addition, approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the\ncourse of a product candidate’s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays in the approval or the decision not to approve an application.\nRegulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and\nrequire additional preclinical, clinical or other data. Even if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of any regulatory filing for our product candidates, the\nFDA, the EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may approve our product candidates for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we\noriginally requested. We have not submitted for, or obtained, regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or\nany product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nFurther, development of our product candidates and/or regulatory approval may be delayed for reasons beyond our control.\nApplications for our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n● the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design, implementation or results of our clinical trials;\n● the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may determine that our product candidates are not safe and effective, only moderately effective\nor have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use;\n● the population studied in the clinical trial may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure efficacy and safety in the full population for which we seek\napproval;\n● the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n● the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, or other\nsubmission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n● we may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate’s risk-benefit ratio for its proposed\nindication is acceptable;\n● the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve our manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications or facilities\nor those of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n● the approval policies or regulations of the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our\nclinical data insufficient for approval.\n32\nThis lengthy, uncertain approval process, as well as the unpredictability of the results of clinical trials, may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market any of\nour product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects. In addition, the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities may change their policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations or take other actions, which may prevent or delay approval of our future\nproduct candidates under development on a timely basis. Such policy or regulatory changes could impose additional requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain\napprovals, increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain any marketing authorizations we may have obtained.\nWe may encounter substantial delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must complete\npreclinical development and extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and\nimplement, can take many years to complete and its ultimate outcome is uncertain. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of the process. The outcome of\npreclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials.\nWe do not know whether our future clinical trials will begin on time or enroll patients on time, or whether our ongoing and/or future clinical trials will be completed on\nschedule or at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays related to:\n● the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreeing as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n● obtaining regulatory authorizations to commence a trial or reaching a consensus with regulatory authorities on trial design;\n● any failure or delay in reaching an agreement with CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly\namong different CROs and trial sites;\n● obtaining approval from one or more independent institutional review boards, or IRBs;\n● IRBs refusing to approve, suspending or terminating the trial at an investigational site, precluding enrollment of additional subjects, or withdrawing their approval of\nthe trial;\n● delays in enrollment due to travel or quarantine policies, or other factors related pandemics or other events outside our control;\n● changes to clinical trial protocol;\n● clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n● manufacturing sufficient quantities of a product candidate or obtaining sufficient quantities of combination therapies for use in clinical trials;\n● subjects failing to enroll or remain in our trial at the rate we expect, or failing to return for post- treatment follow-up;\n● subjects choosing an alternative treatment for the indication for which we are developing our product candidates, or participating in competing clinical trials;\n● lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial;\n● subjects experiencing severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects;\n● occurrence of serious adverse events in trials of the same class of agents conducted by other companies;\n● selection of clinical endpoints that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting data;\n● a facility manufacturing our product candidates or any of their components being ordered by the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to\ntemporarily or permanently shut down due to violations of cGMP regulations or other applicable requirements, or infections or cross-contaminations of product\ncandidates in the manufacturing process;\n● any changes to our manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired;\n● third-party clinical investigators losing the licenses or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or\nconsistent with the clinical trial protocol, GCP or other regulatory requirements;\n● third-party contractors not performing data collection or analysis in a timely or accurate manner; or\n● third-party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA, the EMA or other government or regulatory authorities for violations of\nregulatory requirements, in which case we may need to find a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or all of the data produced by such contractors\nin support of our marketing applications.\n33\nConducting clinical trials in foreign countries, as we may do for our product candidates, presents additional risks that may delay completion of our clinical trials. These risks\ninclude the failure of enrolled patients in foreign countries to adhere to clinical protocol as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional\nadministrative burdens associated with foreign regulatory schemes, as well as political and economic risks relevant to such foreign countries.\nAdditionally, if the results of our clinical trials are inconclusive or if there are safety concerns or serious adverse events associated with our product candidates, we may:\n● be delayed in obtaining marketing approval, if at all;\n● obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n● obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n● be required to perform additional clinical trials to support approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n● be subject to the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n● be sued; or\n● experience damage to our reputation.\nOur development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or obtaining marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical\ntrials will begin as planned, need to be restructured or be completed on schedule, if at all. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay the submission of a BLA\nto the FDA or similar applications with comparable foreign regulatory authorities and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, and generate\nproduct revenue. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our claims for differentiation or the effectiveness or\nsafety of our product candidate. The FDA has substantial discretion in the review and approval process and may disagree that our data support the claims we propose.\nMoreover, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such\nservices. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The\nFDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of\ninterest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study. The FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may therefore question the integrity of the data\ngenerated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing\napplications by the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of one or\nmore of our product candidates.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed,\nand our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. Moreover, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs,\nslow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues.\nIn addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical trials may also ultimately lead to\nthe denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any delays to our clinical trials that occur as a result could shorten any period during which we may have the exclusive\nright to commercialize our product candidates and our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product\ncandidates could be significantly reduced. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\n34\nThe outcome of preclinical studies or early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and the results of our clinical trials may not satisfy the\nrequirements of the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nPositive results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials do not mean that future clinical trials will be successful. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial\nprocess. We do not know whether any of our product candidates will perform in current or future clinical trials as they have performed in preclinical studies and early clinical\ntrials. Product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA and other comparable\nforeign regulatory authorities despite having progressed through preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors,\nincluding changes in trial protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations, differences in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other trial protocols and the\nrate of dropout among clinical trial participants. Patients treated with our product candidates may also be undergoing surgical, radiation and chemotherapy treatments and may\nbe using other approved products or investigational new drugs, which can cause side effects or adverse events that are unrelated to our product candidate. As a result,\nassessments of efficacy can vary widely for a particular patient, and from patient to patient and site to site within a clinical trial. This subjectivity can increase the uncertainty\nof, and adversely impact, our clinical trial outcomes. We do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety\nsufficient to obtain marketing approval to market our product candidates. Most product candidates that begin clinical trials are never approved by regulatory authorities for\ncommercialization.\nAdditionally, some of our planned clinical trials may utilize an “open-label” trial design. An “open-label” clinical trial is one where both the patient and investigator know\nwhether the patient is receiving either the investigational product candidate or an existing approved pharmaceutical or placebo. Most typically, open-label clinical trials test\nonly the investigational product candidate and sometimes may do so at different dose levels. Open-label clinical trials are subject to various limitations that may exaggerate any\ntherapeutic effect as patients in open-label clinical trials are aware when they are receiving treatment. Open-label clinical trials may be subject to a “patient bias” where patients\nperceive their symptoms to have improved merely due to their awareness of receiving an experimental treatment. In addition, open-label clinical trials may be subject to an\n“investigator bias” where those assessing and reviewing the physiological outcomes of the clinical trials are aware of which patients have received treatment and may interpret\nthe information of the treated group more favorably given this knowledge. The results from an open-label trial may not be predictive of future clinical trial results with any of\nour product candidates for which we include an open-label clinical trial when studied in a controlled environment with a placebo or active control.\nMoreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses and many companies that believed their product candidates performed\nsatisfactorily in preclinical studies or clinical trials nonetheless failed to obtain FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authority approval. We cannot guarantee that the\nFDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities will interpret trial results as we do, and more trials could be required before we are able to submit applications\nseeking approval of our product candidates. This is particularly true for clinical trials in rare diseases, where the very small patient population makes it difficult to conduct two\ntraditional, adequate and well-controlled studies, and therefore the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities are often required to exercise flexibility in\napproving therapies for such diseases. To the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for\nsupport of a marketing application, we may be required to expend significant resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential\napproval of our product candidates. Even if regulatory approval is secured for any of our product candidates, the terms of such approval may limit the scope and use of our\nproduct candidate, which may also limit its commercial potential. Furthermore, the approval policies or regulations of the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval, which may lead to the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities delaying, limiting or denying approval of our product candidates.\n35\nInterim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are\nsubject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose interim, preliminary or topline data from our preclinical studies or clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-\navailable data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or\ntrial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and\ncarefully evaluate all data. As a result, the interim, topline or preliminary results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or\nconsiderations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Interim, preliminary and topline data also remain subject to audit and\nverification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim, topline and\npreliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Adverse differences between preliminary, topline or interim data and final data could\nsignificantly harm our business prospects.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the\nimportance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate and our\ncompany in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information,\nand you or others may not agree with what we determine is material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure. If the interim, topline or preliminary data\nthat we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and\ncommercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nOur current or future product candidates may cause adverse events, toxicities or other undesirable side effects when used alone or in combination with other approved\nproducts or investigational new drugs that may result in a safety profile that could inhibit regulatory approval, prevent market acceptance, limit their commercial potential\nor result in significant negative consequences.\nAs is the case with biopharmaceuticals generally, it is likely that there may be side effects and adverse events associated with our product candidates’ use. Results of our clinical\ntrials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects or unexpected characteristics. Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could\ncause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA,\nthe EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or\nresult in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nIf our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have unexpected characteristics in preclinical studies or clinical trials when used alone or in\ncombination with other approved products or investigational new drugs we may need to interrupt, delay or abandon their development or limit development to more narrow\nuses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Treatment-\nrelated side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial, or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these\noccurrences may prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and may harm our business, financial condition and prospects\nsignificantly.\nPatients in our ongoing and planned clinical trials in the future may suffer significant adverse events or other side effects not observed in our preclinical studies or previous\nclinical trials. Some of our product candidates may be used as chronic therapies or be used in pediatric populations, for which safety concerns may be particularly scrutinized\nby regulatory agencies. In addition, if our product candidates are used in combination with other therapies, our product candidates may exacerbate adverse events associated\nwith the therapy. Patients treated with our product candidates may also be undergoing surgical, radiation or chemotherapy treatments, which can cause side effects or adverse\nevents that are unrelated to our product candidate but may still impact the success of our clinical trials. The inclusion of critically ill patients in our clinical trials may result in\ndeaths or other adverse medical events due to other therapies or medications that such patients may be using or due to the gravity of such patients’ illnesses.\n36\nIf significant adverse events or other side effects are observed in any of our current or future clinical trials, we may have difficulty recruiting patients to the clinical trials,\npatients may drop out of our trials, or we may be required to abandon the trials or our development efforts of that product candidate altogether. We, the FDA, the EMA, other\ncomparable regulatory authorities or an IRB may suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons, including a belief that subjects in such trials are\nbeing exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects.\nAdditionally, if any of our product candidates receives regulatory approval and becomes a product, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such\nproduct, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result. For example, the FDA could require us to adopt a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or\nREMS, to ensure that the benefits of treatment with such product outweigh the risks for each potential patient, which may include, among other things, a communication plan to\nhealth care practitioners, patient education, extensive patient monitoring or distribution systems and processes that are highly controlled, restrictive and more costly than what is\ntypical for the industry. We or our collaborators may also be required to adopt a REMS or engage in similar actions, such as patient education, certification of health care\nprofessionals or specific monitoring, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by any product that we develop alone or with collaborators. Other potentially\nsignificant negative consequences include that:\n● we may be forced to suspend marketing of that product, or decide to remove the product from the marketplace;\n● regulatory authorities may withdraw or change their approvals of that product;\n● regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or limit access of that product to selective specialized centers with additional safety reporting and\nwith requirements that patients be geographically close to these centers for all or part of their treatment;\n● we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of the product for patients, or to conduct post-marketing studies;\n● we may be required to change the way the product is administered;\n● we could be subject to fines, injunctions, or the imposition of criminal or civil penalties, or be sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects or patients; and\n● the product may become less competitive, and our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of our product candidates and prevent us from achieving or maintaining market\nacceptance of the affected product candidate, if approved by applicable regulatory authorities.\nEven if approved, our product candidates may not achieve adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical\ncommunity necessary for commercial success.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval and become a product, they may not gain adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors\nand others in the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n● the efficacy and safety profile as demonstrated in clinical trials compared to alternative treatments;\n● the timing of market introduction of the product as well as competitive products;\n● the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n● restrictions on the use of our product, such as boxed warnings or contraindications in labeling, or a REMS, if any, which may not be required of alternative treatments\nand competitor products;\n● the potential and perceived advantages of products over alternative treatments;\n● the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n● the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement, as well as pricing, by third-party payors, including government authorities;\n● relative convenience and ease of administration;\n37\n● the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n● the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;\n● unfavorable publicity relating to our products or similar approved products or product candidates in development by third parties; and\n● the approval of other new therapies for the same indications.\nIf any of our product candidates is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate\nor derive sufficient revenue from that product candidate and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nOur refrigerated product candidates require specific storage, handling and administration at the clinical sites.\nOur refrigerated drug product candidates must be stored at low temperatures in specialized refrigerated containers until immediately prior to use. For administration, the drug\nproduct container must be carefully removed from storage, warmed to room temperature and inverted to place cells into suspension prior to drawing the product into syringes.\nThe handling, warming and administration of the cell therapy product must be performed according to specific instructions. Failure to correctly handle the product, follow the\ninstructions for warming and administration and/or failure to administer the product within the specified period post-warming could negatively impact the efficacy and or safety\nof the product.\nBecause cell therapy is novel and the regulatory landscape that governs any cell therapy product candidates we may develop is rigorous, complex, uncertain and subject to\nchange, we cannot predict the time and cost of obtaining regulatory approval, if we receive it at all, for any product candidates we may develop. At the moment, only a\nsmall number of cell therapy products have been approved in the United States and the European Union.\nThe regulatory requirements that will govern any novel cell therapy product candidates we develop are not entirely clear and are subject to change. Within the broader genetic\nmedicine field, very few therapeutic products have received marketing authorization from the FDA or the EMA. Even with respect to more established products that fit into the\ncategories of gene therapies or cell therapies, the regulatory landscape is still developing. Regulatory requirements governing cell therapy products have changed frequently and\nwill likely continue to change in the future. Moreover, there is substantial overlap in those responsible for regulation of existing cell therapy products. For example, in the\nUnited States, the FDA has established the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to consolidate the review of cell\ntherapy and related products. Although the FDA has approved other cell-based therapies, there is no assurance that these previous approvals will affect the FDA’s review of our\nproduct candidates.\nOur cell therapy product candidates will need to meet safety and efficacy standards applicable to any new biologic under the regulatory framework administered by the FDA. In\naddition to FDA oversight and oversight by IRBs, under the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules,\nor NIH Guidelines, cell therapy clinical trials are also subject to review and oversight by an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that\nreviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any\npotential risk to public health or the environment. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by\ninstitutions receiving National Institutes of Health, or NIH, funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not\notherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. Although the FDA decides whether individual cell therapy protocols may proceed, the review process and\ndeterminations of other reviewing bodies can impede or delay the initiation of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the trial and approved its initiation.\nThe same applies in the European Union. The EMA’s Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, is responsible for assessing the quality, safety, and efficacy of advanced-\ntherapy medicinal products. Advanced-therapy medicinal products include cell therapy medicines, somatic-cell therapy medicines and tissue-engineered medicines. The role of\nthe CAT is to prepare a draft opinion on an application for marketing authorization for a cell therapy medicinal candidate that is submitted to the EMA. In the European Union,\nthe development and evaluation of a cell therapy product must be considered in the context of the relevant EU guidelines. The EMA may issue new guidelines concerning the\ndevelopment and marketing authorization for cell therapy products and require that we comply with these new guidelines. As a result, the procedures and standards applied to\ncell therapy products may be applied to any cell therapy product candidate we may develop, but that remains uncertain at this point.\n38\nAdverse developments in preclinical studies or clinical trials conducted by others in the field of cell therapy and cell regulation products may cause the FDA, the EMA and\nother regulatory bodies to revise the requirements for approval of any product candidates we may develop or limit the use of products utilizing cell therapy technologies, either\nof which could harm our business. In addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities and the criteria these regulators use to\ndetermine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use and market of the potential products.\nThe regulatory approval process for product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known, or more extensively studied\npharmaceutical or other product candidates. Further, as we are developing novel potential treatments for diseases in which, in some cases, there is little clinical experience with\npotential new endpoints and methodologies, there is heightened risk that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory bodies may not consider the clinical trial endpoints to provide\nclinically meaningful results, and the resulting clinical data and results may be more difficult to analyze. In addition, we may not be able to identify or develop appropriate\nanimal disease models to enable or support planned clinical development. Any natural history studies that we may conduct or rely upon in our clinical development may not be\naccepted by the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities. Regulatory agencies administering existing or future regulations or legislation may not allow production and\nmarketing of products utilizing cell therapy technology in a timely manner or under technically or commercially feasible conditions. In addition, regulatory action or private\nlitigation could result in expenses, delays or other impediments to our research programs or the commercialization of resulting products. Further, approvals by one regulatory\nagency may not be indicative of what other regulatory agencies may require for approval.\nThe regulatory review committees and advisory groups described above and the new guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to\nperform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and\ncommercialization of these product candidates, or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As we advance our research programs and develop future product\ncandidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and to comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay\nor discontinue development of any product candidates we identify and develop. These additional processes may result in a review and approval process that is longer than we\notherwise would have expected. Delays as a result of an increased or lengthier regulatory approval process or further restrictions on the development of our product candidates\ncan be costly and could negatively impact our ability to complete clinical trials and commercialize our current and future product candidates in a timely manner, if at all.\nWe may be unable to obtain U.S. or foreign regulatory approvals and, as a result, may be unable to commercialize our product candidates.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research, testing, development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy,\napproval, recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, storage, packaging, advertising and promotion, pricing, marketing and distribution of drugs. Rigorous preclinical studies and\nclinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process must be successfully completed in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be\nmarketed. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time-consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. We cannot provide any assurance\nthat any product candidate we may develop will progress through required clinical testing and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us to begin selling them.\nWe have not conducted, managed or completed large-scale or pivotal clinical trials nor managed the regulatory approval process with the FDA, the EMA or any other\nregulatory authority with respect to our current product candidates. The time required to obtain approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities is unpredictable and\nrequires successful completion of extensive clinical trials which typically takes many years, depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. The\nstandards that the FDA and its foreign counterparts use when evaluating clinical trial data can and often changes during drug development, which makes it difficult to predict\nwith any certainty how they will be applied. We may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, including future legislation or\nadministrative action, or changes in FDA policy during the period of drug development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review.\n39\nAny delay or failure in seeking or obtaining required approvals would have a material and adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the particular product\ncandidate for which we are developing and seeking approval. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product candidate may be subject to significant limitations on\nthe approved uses or indications for which we may market the product candidate or the labeling or other restrictions. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a REMS\nas part of approving an NDA or BLA, or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved product candidate.\nThese requirements or restrictions might include limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to\npatients who meet certain safe-use criteria and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry. These limitations and restrictions may significantly limit the size of the market\nfor the product candidate and affect reimbursement by third-party payors.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization,\npricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process varies among countries, and generally includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval\ndescribed above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval may differ from that\nrequired to obtain FDA approval.\nWe may develop our current and future product candidates in combination with other therapies, which exposes us to additional risks, and certain of our product candidates\nare regulated as combination products.\nWe may develop our current and future product candidates in combination with one or more other approved or unapproved therapies to treat skin and connective tissue diseases\nor other diseases. We may also develop certain product candidates as biologic/drug combination products. Additional time may be required to obtain regulatory approval for our\nproduct candidates because they are combination products. Our product candidates that are biologic/drug combination products require coordination within the FDA and similar\nforeign regulatory agencies for review of their biologic and drug components. Although the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies have systems in place for the review\nand approval of combination products such as ours, we may experience delays in the development and commercialization of our product candidates due to regulatory timing\nconstraints and uncertainties in the product development and approval process.\nIn addition, even if any product candidate we develop were to receive marketing approval or be commercialized for use in combination with other existing therapies, we would\ncontinue to be subject to the risks that the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could revoke approval of the therapy used in combination with our\nproduct or that safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues could arise with any of those existing therapies. If the therapies we use in combination with our product\ncandidates are replaced as the standard of care for the indications we choose for any of our product candidates, the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities\nmay require us to conduct additional clinical trials. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in our own product candidates, if approved, being removed from the market\nor being less successful commercially.\nWe also may choose to evaluate our current product candidates or any future product candidates in combination with one or more therapies that have not yet been approved for\nmarketing by the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We will not be able to market and sell our product candidates we develop in combination with an\nunapproved therapy for a combination indication if that unapproved therapy does not ultimately obtain marketing approval either alone or in combination with our product\ncandidate. In addition, unapproved therapies face the same risks described with respect to our product candidates currently in development and clinical trials, including the\npotential for serious adverse effects, delay in their clinical trials and lack of FDA approval.\nIf the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities do not approve these other products or revoke their approval of, or if safety, efficacy, quality, manufacturing\nor supply issues arise with, the products we choose to evaluate in combination with our product candidates we develop, we may be unable to obtain approval of or market such\ncombination therapy.\n40\nAny product candidates for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each as amended, or collectively, the ACA, includes a\nsubtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are\nbiosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA\nuntil four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the\nFDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing\nversion of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-\ncontrolled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a\nresult, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully\nadopted by the FDA, any such processes could have an adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nThere is a risk that any of our product candidates approved as a biological product under a BLA would not qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity or that this exclusivity\ncould be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider our product candidates to be reference products for competing products,\npotentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions,\nhave also been the subject of litigation. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is\nsimilar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still\ndeveloping. If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our candidates, if approved, our products may become subject to competition from\nsuch biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and potential adverse consequences.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more\nprofitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs, therapeutic platforms and product candidates that we identify for specific\nindications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other therapeutic platforms or product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have\ngreater commercial potential or a greater likelihood of success. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable\nmarket opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs, therapeutic platforms and product candidates for specific indications may not\nyield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish\nvaluable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain\nsole development and commercialization rights.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur company has limited experience in designing clinical trials and may experience delays or unexpected difficulties in obtaining regulatory approval for our current and\nfuture product candidates.\nWe have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. We cannot be certain that our\nplanned clinical trials or any future clinical trials will be successful. It is possible that the FDA may refuse to accept any or all of our planned BLAs for substantive review or\nmay conclude after review of our data that our application is insufficient to obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates. If the FDA does not approve any of our\nplanned BLAs, it may require that we conduct additional costly clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing validation studies before it will reconsider our applications.\nDepending on the extent of these or any other FDA-required studies, approval of any BLA or other application that we submit may be significantly delayed, possibly for several\nyears, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available. Any failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing our\nproduct candidates, generating revenues and achieving and sustaining profitability. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered\nsufficient by the FDA to approve any BLA or other application that we submit. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon the development of our product\ncandidates, which would materially adversely affect our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations. We face similar risks for our applications in foreign\njurisdictions.\n41\nWe intend to identify and develop novel cell therapy product candidates, which makes it difficult to predict the time, cost and potential success of product candidate\ndevelopment.\nOur strategy is to identify, develop and commercialize cell therapy product candidates using our proprietary fibroblast technology, which involves collecting skin biopsies from\ndonor patients, isolating cells and expanding them in culture. Our future success depends on the successful development of these novel therapeutic approaches. To date, no\nfibroblast therapy products have been approved. In addition, there have been a few number of clinical trials involving fibroblasts as compared to other, more conventional\nforms of therapy.\nThe sizes of the markets for our product candidates are estimates, and these markets may be smaller than estimated.\nThe estimates in this annual report of the annual addressable markets for our product candidates are based on a number of third-party estimates. While we believe the\nassumptions and the data underlying the estimates are reasonable, these assumptions and estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting the assumptions or\nestimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. As a result, the estimates of the annual addressable market for our\nproduct candidates may prove to be incorrect.\nOur long-term prospects depend in part upon discovering, developing and commercializing additional product candidates, which may fail in development or suffer delays\nthat adversely affect their commercial viability.\nOur future operating results are dependent on our ability to successfully discover, develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize product candidates beyond those\nwe currently have in clinical development. A product candidate can unexpectedly fail at any stage of preclinical or clinical development. The historical failure rate for product\ncandidates is high due to risks relating to safety, efficacy, clinical execution, changing standards of medical care and other unpredictable variables. The results from preclinical\nstudies or early clinical trials of a product candidate may not be predictive of the results that will be obtained in later stage clinical trials of the product candidate.\nThe success of other product candidates we may develop will depend on many factors, including the following:\n● generating sufficient data to support the initiation or continuation of clinical trials;\n● obtaining regulatory permission to initiate clinical trials;\n● contracting with the necessary parties to conduct clinical trials;\n● successful enrollment of patients in, and the completion of, clinical trials on a timely basis;\n● the timely manufacture of sufficient quantities of the product candidate and other key materials needed for use in clinical trials; and\n● adverse events in the clinical trials.\nEven if we successfully advance any other product candidates into clinical development, their success will be subject to all of the clinical, regulatory and commercial risks\ndescribed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to discover, develop, obtain regulatory approval of,\ncommercialize or generate significant revenue from our product candidates.\n42\nWe have never commercialized a fibroblast cell-based therapy product candidate before and may lack the necessary expertise, personnel and resources to successfully\ncommercialize any product candidates, if approved, on our own or together with suitable collaborators.\nWe have never commercialized a fibroblast cell-based therapy product candidate, and we currently have no sales force, marketing or distribution capabilities. To achieve\ncommercial success for our current product candidates, which we may license to others, we will rely on the assistance and guidance of those collaborators. For any approved\nproduct candidates for which we retain commercialization rights, we will have to develop our own sales, marketing and supply organization or outsource these activities to a\nthird party.\nFactors that may affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates on our own include recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing\npersonnel, obtaining access to or persuading adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our product candidates and other unforeseen costs associated with creating an\nindependent sales and marketing organization. Developing a sales and marketing organization will be expensive and time-consuming and could delay the launch of our product\ncandidates, if approved. We may not be able to build an effective sales and marketing organization. If we are unable to build our own distribution and marketing capabilities or\nto find suitable partners for the commercialization of our product candidates, we may not generate revenues from them or be able to reach or sustain profitability.\nWe face significant competition, and if our competitors develop and market technologies or products more rapidly than we do or that are more effective, safer or less\nexpensive than the product candidates we develop, our commercial opportunities will be negatively impacted.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary and novel\nproducts and product candidates. Our competitors have developed, are developing or may develop products, product candidates and processes competitive with our product\ncandidates. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the\nfuture. We believe that a significant number of products are currently under development, and may become commercially available in the future, for the treatment of conditions\nfor which we may attempt to develop product candidates. See “Business—Competition” for additional details. In addition, our products may need to compete with off-label\ndrugs used by physicians to treat the indications for which we seek approval. This may make it difficult for us to replace existing therapies with our products.\nMany current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources and commercial\nexpertise than we do. Large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, recruiting\npatients and manufacturing biotechnology products. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products\nthat have been approved or are in late stages of development, and collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions.\nEstablished pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel\ncompounds that could make the product candidates that we develop obsolete. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly\nthrough collaborative arrangements with large and established companies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. As a result,\nour competitors may succeed in obtaining approval from the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities or in discovering, developing and\ncommercializing products in our field before we do.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe\neffects, are more convenient, have a broader label, are marketed more effectively, are reimbursed or are less expensive than any product candidates that we may develop. Our\ncompetitors also may obtain marketing approval from the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for their products more rapidly than we may obtain\napproval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Even if the product candidates we develop\nachieve marketing approval, they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive products if any have been approved by then, resulting in reduced competitiveness.\nTechnological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our technologies or product candidates obsolete, less competitive or uneconomical. If we are\nunable to compete effectively, our opportunity to generate revenue from the sale of any products we may develop, if approved, could be adversely affected.\n43\nWe are currently a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq Stock Market Rules because our insiders beneficially own more than 50% of the voting power\nof our outstanding voting securities.\nOur founder and Chief Executive Officer, Pete O’Heeron, collectively and beneficially owns approximately 59% of the voting power of our outstanding voting securities and\nwe are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the listing rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. We may rely on certain exemptions from corporate governance rules,\nincluding an exemption from the rule that a majority of our board of directors must be independent directors. Although we currently do not intend to rely on the “controlled\ncompany” exemption under the Nasdaq listing rules, we could elect to rely on this exemption in the future. In the event that we elected to rely on the “controlled company”\nexemption, a majority of the members of our board of directors might not be independent directors, and our nominating and corporate governance and compensation\ncommittees might not consist entirely of independent directors. Our status as a controlled company could cause our shares of our common stock to be less attractive to certain\ninvestors or otherwise harm our trading price. As a result, you would not have the same protection afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to these corporate\ngovernance requirements.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. We are\nsubject to financial reporting and other requirements for which our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared.\nAs a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur\nas a private company. In addition, the federal securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and\nrules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requirements to file annual,\nquarterly, and event driven reports with respect to their business and financial condition, and to establish and maintain effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate\ngovernance practices. These rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make certain activities more time-consuming and costly, and require\nour management and other personnel to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance initiatives.\nDespite our best efforts, we may not be able to produce reliable financial statements or file such financial statements as part of a periodic report in a timely manner with the\nSEC or comply with Nasdaq listing requirements. We also expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and\nofficer liability insurance.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we will be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, including an\nattestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm, beginning with the first full year after we become a\npublic company. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting\nissued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we will be engaged in a process to document\nand evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. We will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage\noutside consultants, adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as\nappropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed\ntimeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This could result in an adverse reaction in the\nfinancial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. We could also become subject to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory\nauthorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\n44\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures means our controls and other procedures that are\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,\nwithin the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting\nwill prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. We believe a control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that\nthe control system’s objectives will be met. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements\ndue to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and any design may not succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations\nin our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to lack of segregation of duties. Failure to maintain effective internal control\nover financial reporting could cause our investors to lose confidence in us and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If our internal controls over\nfinancial reporting are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nDuring the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting due to a lack of segregation of duties. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial\nreporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely\nbasis.\nSpecifically, our management identified a deficiency in our internal controls within the financial reporting function that resulted from a lack of segregation of duties for the\nperiod of time covered by our financial statements prior to our Chief Financial Officer joining us in June 2022 when all financial functions were handled by a single individual.\nWith the addition of our Chief Financial Officer and the changes made to our accounting and financial reporting processes and internal controls during the last half of fiscal\nyear 2022, we have strengthened our internal controls and will continue to evaluate segregation of duties and take initiatives to improve our internal controls over financial\nreporting as we grow. However, the implementation of these initiatives may not fully address the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and we\ncannot assure you that we will not identify other material weaknesses or deficiencies, which could negatively impact our results of operations in future periods.\nRisks Relating to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties, including independent clinical investigators and CROs, to conduct certain aspects of our preclinical studies and\nclinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, comply with applicable regulatory requirements or meet expected deadlines, we\nmay not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be adversely harmed.\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third parties, including independent clinical investigators and third-party CROs, to conduct certain aspects of our\npreclinical studies and clinical trials and to monitor and manage data for our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical\nstudies and clinical trials, and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies and trials is conducted in\naccordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on these third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.\nWe, our third-party contractors and CROs are required to comply with GCP requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign\nregulatory authorities for all of our product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors,\nprincipal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties or our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may\nbe deemed unreliable and the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing\napplications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP\nregulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products manufactured under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us\nto repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be adversely affected if any of these third parties violates federal or\nstate fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws.\n45\nFurther, there is no guarantee that any such CROs, investigators or other third parties on which we rely will devote adequate time and resources to our development activities or\nperform as contractually required. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be\nconducting clinical trials or other product development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If independent investigators or CROs fail to devote\nsufficient resources to the development of our product candidates, or if CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if\nthey need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory\nrequirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully\ncommercialize our product candidates. Consequently, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could\nincrease and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed or halted entirely.\nOur CROs have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an uncured material breach. In addition, some of our CROs have an ability to terminate their\nrespective agreements with us if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the subjects participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination, if we make a\ngeneral assignment for the benefit of our creditors or if we are liquidated.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable\nterms. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO\ncommences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Additionally, CROs may lack the\ncapacity to absorb higher workloads or take on additional capacity to support our needs. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no\nassurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business,\nfinancial condition and prospects.\nIf we decide to establish additional collaborations but are not able to establish those collaborations on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to alter our\ndevelopment and commercialization plans.\nOur product candidate development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. We may\ncontinue to seek to selectively form collaborations to expand our capabilities, potentially accelerate research and development activities and provide for commercialization\nactivities by third parties. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that\ndilute our existing stockholders, or disrupt our management and business.\nWe would face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Whether we reach a definitive\nagreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed\ncollaboration and the proposed collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by\nthe FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and\ndelivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of intellectual property and\nindustry and market conditions generally. The potential collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be\navailable to collaborate on and whether such collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. Further, we may not be successful in our\nefforts to establish a collaboration or other alternative arrangements for future product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for\ncollaborative effort and third parties may not view them as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy.\n46\nIn addition, mergers among large biopharmaceutical companies may result in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. Even if we are successful in entering into a\ncollaboration, the terms and conditions of that collaboration may restrict us from entering into future agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators.\nIf and when we seek to enter into collaborations, we may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we\nmay have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential\ncommercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own\nexpense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be\navailable to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and\ngenerate product revenue.\nIn the future we may enter into collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of product candidates. If those collaborations are not\nsuccessful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nWe may in the future seek third-party collaborators for the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our likely collaborators for any future\ncollaboration arrangements include large and mid-size biopharmaceutical companies, regional and national biopharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. We\nhave and will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product\ncandidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators’ abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to\nthem in these arrangements. Collaborations involving our product candidates could pose numerous risks to us, including the following:\n● collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations and may not perform their obligations as\nexpected;\n● collaborators may deemphasize or not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or\ncommercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators’ strategic focus, including as a result of a sale or disposition of a business unit\nor development function, or available funding or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n● collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct\nnew clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n● collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators\nbelieve that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n● a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to multiple products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of our product\ncandidates relative to other products;\n● collaborators may not properly obtain, maintain, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information and intellectual property in\nsuch a way as to invite litigation or other intellectual property-related proceedings that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information and intellectual\nproperty or expose us to potential litigation or other intellectual property-related proceedings;\n● disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates\nor that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n● collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable\nproduct candidates;\n● collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all; and\n● if a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product candidate development or\ncommercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\n47\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs, suppliers and vendors may engage in misconduct or other\nimproper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs, suppliers and vendors may\nengage in misconduct or other improper activities. Misconduct by these parties could include failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the\nFDA, comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, accurately report financial information or data or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In\nparticular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct,\nkickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales\ncommission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by these parties could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the\ncourse of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by these parties,\nand the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental\ninvestigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not\nsuccessful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant penalties,\nincluding civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare\nprograms, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the\ncurtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing\nManufacturing cell therapy products is complex and subject to both human and systemic risks. Our third-party manufacturers or we may encounter difficulties in\nproduction and sourcing and may be subject to variations and supply constraints of critical components. If we or any of our third-party manufacturers encounter such\ndifficulties, our ability to supply our product candidates for clinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or prevented.\nThe manufacture of biologic cell therapy product candidates, and products, if approved, is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including\ndeveloping advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of biologic products often encounter difficulties in production and sourcing, particularly in\nscaling up or out, validating the production process, and assuring high reliability of the manufacturing processes (including the absence of contamination), in light of variations\nand supply constraints of critical components. These problems include logistics and shipping, difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including\nconsistency, stability, purity, and efficacy of the product, product testing, operator error, and availability of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced\nfederal, state and foreign regulations. Furthermore, if contaminants are discovered in our supply of our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities, such\nmanufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. We cannot assure you that any stability, purity, and\nefficacy failures, deficiencies, or other issues relating to manufacturing our product candidates will not occur in the future.\nAdditionally, our product candidates are derived from cells collected from humans. Such cells may vary in type and quality as the donors may vary in age, medical history and\nmany other factors. We have strict specifications for donor cell material and our product candidates. The donor cell material variability may exceed our manufacturing process\ncapability or deviate from the specified ranges and result in failure in the production of the cell therapy product, lower quality batches, or even require adjustments to the\nspecifications approved by authorities. The donor cell material may also be variable in factors that we currently may not be able to detect with the analytical methods used or\nmay not know how to measure. We may also discover failures with the material after production. As a result, we may not be able to deliver the quality and consistency of our\ncell therapy products that we need or may need to re-collect cell material which can increase costs and/or cause delay, adversely impact patient outcomes and otherwise harm\nour clinical trials, reputation, business and prospects.\n48\nWe may fail to manage the logistics of collecting and shipping patient material to the manufacturing site, shipping the product candidate back to the relevant parties, and\nexperiencing delays or shortages of certain clinical or commercial-grade supplies and components. Logistical and shipment delays and problems caused by us, our vendors, or\nother factors not in our control, including business interruptions, global supply chain issues, and weather, could prevent or delay the delivery of product candidates to patients.\nAdditionally, we have to maintain a complex chain of identity and chain of custody with respect to donor material as it moves to the manufacturing facility, through the\nmanufacturing processes, and ultimately to a patient. Failure to maintain a chain of identity and chain of custody could result in patient death, loss of product, or regulatory\naction.\nThe transfer or production of our cell banks to a contract development manufacturing organization may fail and result in delays, additional costs, or technical failure.\nWe currently purchase our cell therapy product candidates from a contract development and manufacturing organization, or CDMO. We are in the process of contracting with a\nCDMO, for the transfer of our experimental cell bank to produce our master cell bank, working cell bank and our fibroblast cell-based product candidates to enable clinical\ntrials. If the transfer of our experimental cell bank to the CDMO is not successful, we may encounter delays, additional costs, or technical failure of one or more of our product\ncandidates. Similarly, if the CDMO is unable to produce from the experimental cell bank our master cell bank, working cell bank and our fibroblast cell-based product\ncandidates to enable clinical trials, we may encounter delays, additional costs, or technical failure of one or more of our product candidates.\nChanges in the methods of product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.\nAs product candidates proceed through preclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials towards potential marketing approval and commercialization, it is common that various\naspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods, formulation, materials and processes, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and\nproduct characteristics. Such alterations can also occur due to changes in manufacturers. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve their intended objectives. Any\nsuch changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with product\ncandidates produced using the modified manufacturing methods, materials and processes. Such changes may also require additional testing, FDA notification or FDA approval.\nThis could delay the completion of clinical trials, require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials beyond those we currently\nanticipate, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to commercialize our product candidates if approved. In addition, we\nmay be required to make significant changes to our upstream and downstream processes across our pipeline, which could delay the development of future product candidates.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.\nResearch and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical and biological materials, by us and our third-party\nmanufacturers. We currently outsource all manufacturing to third parties. Still, we and our manufacturers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the\nUnited States governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of medical and hazardous materials. Although we believe that our manufacturers’ procedures for\nusing, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting\nfrom medical or hazardous materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability, or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of\nthese materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our\nresources. We do not currently have any insurance for liabilities arising from medical or hazardous materials. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is\nexpensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\n49\nWe rely on third parties for our manufacturing process and may, in the future, depend on third-party manufacturers for our product candidates, and this increases the risk related\nto the timely and sufficient production of our product candidates.\nWe do not have complete control over all aspects of the manufacturing process of, and are dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP\nregulations for manufacturing our cell therapy product candidates. Third-party manufacturers may be unable to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory\nrequirements outside the United States. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory\nrequirements of the FDA, the EMA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain marketing approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we do not have\ncontrol over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA, the EMA or a comparable\nforeign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to\nfind alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain marketing approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.\nOur failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions,\ncivil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any\nof which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates and harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, the raw materials for our\nproduct candidates may be sourced, in some cases, from a single-source supplier. If we were to experience an unexpected loss of supply of any of our product candidates or any\nof our future product candidates for any reason, whether as a result of manufacturing, supply, or storage issues or otherwise, we could experience delays, disruptions,\nsuspensions or terminations of, or be required to restart or repeat, any pending or ongoing clinical trials.\nWe currently rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates for use in development and commercialization under the guidance of members of our\norganization. In the event that we or any of our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with such requirements or to perform with certain requirements in relation to quality,\ntiming, or otherwise, or if our supply of components or other materials becomes limited or interrupted for other reasons, we may be forced to enter into an agreement with\nanother third party, which we may not be able to do on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In particular, any replacement of our third-party manufacturers could require\nsignificant effort and expertise because there may be a limited number of qualified replacements. In some cases, the technical skills or technology required to manufacture our\nproduct candidates may be unique or proprietary to us or the third-party manufacturer. We may have difficulty transferring such skills or technology to another third party, and a\nfeasible alternative may not exist. In addition, certain of our product candidates and our own proprietary methods have never been produced or implemented outside of our\ncompany. Therefore, we may experience delays in our development programs if we attempt to establish new third-party manufacturing arrangements for these product\ncandidates or methods. These factors would increase our reliance on such manufacturers or require us to obtain a license from such manufacturers in order to have another third\nparty manufacture our product candidates. If we are required to or voluntarily stop manufacturing our product candidates for any reason, we will be required to verify that the\nnew manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines and that the product produced is\nequivalent to that produced in our facility. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer and equivalent product could negatively affect our ability to\ndevelop product candidates in a timely manner or within budget.\nOur or a third party’s failure to execute our manufacturing requirements, do so on commercially reasonable terms and timelines, and comply with cGMP requirements could\nadversely affect our business in a number of ways, including:\n● inability to meet our product specifications and quality requirements consistently;\n● inability to initiate or continue clinical trials of our product candidates under development;\n● delays in submitting regulatory applications or receiving marketing approvals for our product candidates, if at all;\n● inability to commercialize any product candidates that receive marketing approval on a timely basis;\n● loss of the cooperation of future collaborators;\n50\n● subjecting third-party manufacturing facilities or our manufacturing facilities to additional inspections by regulatory authorities;\n● requirements to cease development or to recall batches of our product candidates; and\n● in the event of approval to market and commercialize our product candidates, an inability to meet commercial demands for our product candidates or any future\nproduct candidates.\nAny contamination or interruption in our manufacturing processes, shortages of raw materials, or failure of our suppliers to deliver necessary components could result in\ndelays in our clinical development or marketing schedules.\nGiven the nature of cell therapy manufacturing, there is a risk of contamination. Any contamination could adversely affect our ability to produce product candidates on schedule\nand could, therefore, harm our results of operations and cause reputational damage. Additionally, although our cell therapies are tested for contamination prior to release if a\ncontaminated product candidate was administered to a patient, it could result in harm to the patient. Some of the raw materials required in our manufacturing process are\nderived from biological sources. Such raw materials are difficult to procure and may be subject to contamination or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall, or\nrestriction on the use of biologically derived substances in the manufacture of our product candidates could adversely impact or disrupt the commercial manufacturing or the\nproduction of clinical material, which could adversely affect our development timelines and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Compliance Matters\nOur relationships with healthcare professionals, clinical investigators, CROs and third-party payors in connection with our current and future business activities may be\nsubject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security\nlaws, which could expose us to, among other things, criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, exclusion from governmental healthcare programs,\nreputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our\ncurrent and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, clinical investigators, CROs, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and\nabuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our\nproduct candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n● the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any\nremuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for the purchase, lease,\norder, arrangement, or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program,\nsuch as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to\nviolate it to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil fines and criminal penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved,\nimprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a\nviolation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties;\n● the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties and\nauthorize civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things: knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal\ngovernment, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false statement of record material to a false or\nfraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or\ndecreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act even when they do not submit\nclaims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The federal False Claims Act also permits a private\nindividual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the federal False Claims Act and to share in any\nmonetary recovery;\n51\n● the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, a person from knowingly and willfully executing, or\nattempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the\nmoney or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and\nwillfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or\nrepresentations in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-\nKickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n● HIPAA, as further amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing\nregulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose certain requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and\nhealthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities, that perform services for them that\ninvolve the use, creation, maintenance, receipt or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of\nindividually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly\napplicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal\nHIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, there are additional federal, state and non-U.S. laws which\ngovern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances to which we may be subject and many of which differ from each\nother in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts;\n● federal government price reporting laws, which require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government\nprograms;\n● federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;\n● The ACA, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations, which require applicable\nmanufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program\nto report annually to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to\npayments or other transfers of value made to physicians, nurse practitioners, certified nurse anesthetists, physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists, and certified\nnurse midwives as well as teaching hospitals and to disclose ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n● many state laws that govern the privacy of personal information in specified circumstances. For example, in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the\nCCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal\ninformation, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the sale of personal information, and creating a\nnew and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and\npractices to prevent data breaches. While clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA are currently exempt from the CCPA, other personal information\ncollection practices may be subject to the CCPA and possible changes to the CCPA may broaden its scope.\n52\nAdditionally, we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in\nscope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and may apply to our\nbusiness practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-\ngovernmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require biopharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of\nInspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions\nwith Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require biopharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the\nstate and require the registration of biopharmaceutical sales representatives. Privacy and data protection laws from outside of the United States, including, for example, the\nEuropean Union General Data Protection Regulation and the UK Data Protection Act 2018, or, collectively, the GDPR, also govern the privacy and security of personal\ninformation, including health information in some circumstances, and many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. In\naddition, in the United States, there are a number of states that have enacted laws that govern the privacy and security of personal information, many of which differ from each\nother in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state\nrequirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement we could be subject to penalties.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of\napplicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare\nproviders, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Ensuring business arrangements comply with\napplicable healthcare and privacy laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time and resource-consuming and can divert a\ncompany’s attention from the business.\nEnsuring that our internal operations and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs.\nIt is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law\ninvolving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other\ngovernmental laws and regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines,\ndisgorgement, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our\noperations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-\ncompliance with these laws. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly and time consuming, and may require significant financial and personnel resources.\nTherefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. If any of the physicians or other\nproviders or entities with whom we do, or expect to do, business is found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative\nsanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs and imprisonment. If any of the above occur, our ability to operate our business and our results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nWe may be or become subject to evolving global data protection laws and regulations, which may require us to incur substantial compliance costs, and any failure or\nperceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations may harm our business and operations.\nThe global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and we may be or become subject to or affected by numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as\nregulatory guidance, governing the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, security and processing of personal data, such as information that we collect about participants and\nhealthcare providers in connection with clinical trials. Implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, which may\ncreate uncertainty in our business, affect our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to collect, store, transfer use and share personal data, result in liability or impose\nadditional compliance or other costs on us. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state, or foreign laws or self-regulatory standards could result in\nnegative publicity, diversion of management time and effort and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. For example, states, such as California, Virginia,\nColorado, Utah and Connecticut have recently enacted consumer privacy laws that grant rights to data subjects and places privacy and security obligations on entities handling\npersonal data of consumers or households. Some observers note that the CCPA and similar legislation could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy\nlegislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\n53\nIn addition to our operations in the United States, which may be subject to healthcare and other laws relating to the privacy and security of health information and other\npersonal information, we may seek to conduct clinical trials in the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area, or the EEA, and may become subject to additional\nEuropean data privacy laws, regulations and guidelines. We will be subject to the data protection laws of the European Union and United Kingdom in relation to personal data\nwe collect from these territories. These laws impose additional obligations and risk upon our business, including substantial expenses and changes to business operations that\nare required to comply with these laws. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, or Brexit, and the subsequent separation of the data protection\nregimes of these territories mean we are required to comply with separate data protection laws in the European Union and United Kingdom, which may lead to additional\ncompliance costs and could increase our overall risk.\nThe GDPR, which deals with the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, imposes a broad range of strict requirements, including requirements\nrelating to having lawful bases for processing personal data and transferring such information outside the EEA/UK, including to the United States, providing details to those\nindividuals regarding the processing of their personal data, keeping personal data secure, having data processing agreements with third parties who process personal data,\nresponding to individuals’ requests to exercise their rights in respect of their personal data, reporting security breaches involving personal data to the competent national data\nprotection authority and affected individuals, appointing data protection officers, conducting data protection impact assessments and record-keeping.\nThe GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA/UK to countries not regarded by European Commission and the United Kingdom government as\nproviding adequate protection, or the third countries, including the United States. These transfers are prohibited unless an appropriate safeguard specified by data protection\nlaws is implemented, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses, or the SCCs, approved by the European Commission, or a derogation applies. The UK has published its own\ntransfer mechanism, the International Data Transfer Agreement and International Data Transfer Addendum, which enables transfers from the UK and has implemented a similar\nTransfer Equivalence Test. The international transfer obligations under the EU and UK data protection regimes require effort and cost and may result in us needing to make\nstrategic considerations around where EEA/UK personal data is located and which service providers we utilize for the processing of EEA/UK personal data, particularly as the\nenforcement around GDPR international transfer compliance obligations is currently unclear. The UK Government has also now introduced a Data Protection and Digital\nInformation Bill, or the UK Bill, into the UK legislative process with the intention for this bill to reform the UK’s data protection regime. If passed, the final version of the UK\nBill may have the effect of further altering the similarities between the UK and EU data protection regime. This may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our\noverall risk.\nWe cannot assure you that any efforts to comply with any obligations under European privacy laws will be sufficient. If we are investigated by a European data protection\nauthority, we may face fines and other penalties. Any such investigation or charges by European data protection authorities could have a negative effect on our reputation and\nmaterially harm our business.\nOur business entails a significant risk of product liability and if we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage such inability could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness and financial condition.\nOur business exposes us to significant product liability risks inherent in the development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of therapeutic treatments. Product liability\nclaims could delay or prevent completion of our development programs. If we succeed in marketing product candidates, such claims could result in an FDA, EMA or other\nregulatory authority investigation of the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates, our manufacturing processes and facilities or our marketing programs. FDA, EMA\nor other regulatory authority investigations could potentially lead to a recall of our product candidates or more serious enforcement action, limitations on the approved\nindications for which they may be used or suspension or withdrawal of approvals. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may also result in decreased\ndemand for our product candidates, if approved, injury to our reputation, costs to defend the related litigation, a diversion of management’s time and our resources and\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients. We currently have product liability insurance that we believe is appropriate for our stage of development and may\nneed to obtain higher levels prior to marketing any of our product candidates, if approved. Any insurance we have or may obtain may not provide sufficient coverage against\npotential liabilities. Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance at\na reasonable cost to protect us against losses caused by product liability claims that could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n54\nAny product candidates we develop may become subject to unfavorable third-party coverage and reimbursement practices, as well as pricing regulations.\nThe availability and extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, private health coverage\ninsurers, managed care organizations and other third-party payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments. Sales of any of our product candidates\nthat receive marketing approval will depend substantially, both in the United States and internationally, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be\ncovered and reimbursed by third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our\nproduct candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize\nan adequate return on our investment. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIf coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not successfully commercialize any product candidate for which\nwe obtain marketing approval. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult\nbecause of the higher prices often associated with such drugs.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and\nreimbursement for products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement levels for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The Medicare and\nMedicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and\nbiologics. However, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product candidate does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the\nproduct candidate. As a result, the coverage determination process is often time-consuming and costly. This process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for\nthe use of our product candidates to each third-party payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in\nthe first instance. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is: (i) a covered benefit under its health plan; (ii) safe, effective and\nmedically necessary; (iii) appropriate for the specific patient; (iv) cost-effective; and (v) neither experimental nor investigational.\nIncreasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for\nmedical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product\ncandidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific\nproduct candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive\npharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our product candidates. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered\nmedically necessary or cost effective. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product candidate that we commercialize and, if\nreimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be.\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing\nemphasis on cost containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of therapeutics such as our\nproduct candidates. In many countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, medical product prices are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of\nnational health systems. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after a product receives marketing approval. To obtain\nreimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other\navailable therapies. In general, product prices under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for\nproducts, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge\nfor our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our product candidates may be reduced compared with the United States\nand may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.\n55\nIf we are unable to establish or sustain coverage and adequate reimbursement for any future product candidates from third-party payors, the adoption of those product\ncandidates and sales revenue will be adversely affected, which, in turn, could adversely affect the ability to market or sell those product candidates, if approved. Coverage\npolicies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more product candidates\nfor which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nWe face potential liability related to the privacy of health information we obtain from clinical trials sponsored by us.\nMost healthcare providers, including research institutions from which we obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security regulations promulgated under\nHIPAA, as amended by the HITECH. We are not currently classified as a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA and thus are not directly subject to its requirements\nor penalties. However, any person may be prosecuted under HIPAA’s criminal provisions either directly or under aiding-and-abetting or conspiracy principles. Consequently,\ndepending on the facts and circumstances, we could face substantial criminal penalties if we knowingly receive individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-\ncovered healthcare provider or research institution that has not satisfied HIPAA’s requirements for disclosure of individually identifiable health information. In addition, we\nmay maintain sensitive personally identifiable information, including health information, that we receive throughout the clinical trial process, in the course of our research\ncollaborations, and directly from individuals (or their healthcare providers) who enroll in our patient assistance programs. As such, we may be subject to state laws requiring\nnotification of affected individuals and state regulators in the event of a breach of personal information, which is a broader class of information than the health information\nprotected by HIPAA.\nFurthermore, certain health privacy laws, data breach notification laws, consumer protection laws and genetic testing laws may apply directly to our operations and/or those of\nour collaborators and may impose restrictions on our collection, use and dissemination of individuals’ health information. Patients about whom we or our collaborators obtain\nhealth information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may have statutory or contractual rights that limit our ability to use and disclose the\ninformation. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws. Claims that we\nhave violated individuals’ privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and could\nresult in adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nIf we or third-party contract manufacturing organizations, CROs or other contractors or consultants fail to comply with applicable federal, state or local regulatory\nrequirements, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions that could affect our or our contractors’ ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates and\ncould harm or prevent sales of any affected product candidates that we are able to commercialize, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of developing,\ncommercializing and marketing our product candidates. Any threatened or actual government enforcement action could also generate adverse publicity and require that we\ndevote substantial resources that could otherwise be used in other aspects of our business. Increasing use of social media could give rise to liability, breaches of data security or\nreputational damage.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material\nadverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment\nand disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our\noperations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of\ncontamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting\ndamages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\n56\nAlthough we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous\nmaterials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may\nbe asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and\nregulations may impair our research, development or commercialization efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties\nor other sanctions.\nThe FDA, the EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from trials conducted in locations outside of their jurisdiction.\nWe may choose to conduct international clinical trials in the future. The acceptance of study data by the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authority from\nclinical trials conducted outside of their respective jurisdictions may be subject to certain conditions. In cases where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the\nbasis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will generally not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless (i) the data are applicable to the\nUnited States population and United States medical practice; (ii) the trials are performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence and pursuant to current GCP\nrequirements; and (iii) the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate mean. Additionally, the FDA’s clinical trial requirements, including\nthe adequacy of the patient population studied and statistical powering, must be met. In addition, such foreign trials would be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign\njurisdictions where the trials are conducted. There can be no assurance that the FDA, the EMA or any applicable foreign regulatory authority will accept data from trials\nconducted outside of its applicable jurisdiction. If the FDA, the EMA or any applicable foreign regulatory authority does not accept such data, it would result in the need for\nadditional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay aspects of our business plan, and which may result in our product candidates not receiving approval for\ncommercialization in the applicable jurisdiction.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of\nour product candidates in other jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in\nany other jurisdiction. For example, even if the FDA or the EMA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions\nmust also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion and reimbursement of the product candidate in those countries. However, a failure or delay in obtaining\nregulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve\nrequirements and administrative review periods different from those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials as clinical trials conducted in\none jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for\nreimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our product candidates is also subject to approval.\nObtaining foreign regulatory approvals and establishing and maintaining compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and\ncosts for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates in certain countries. If we or any future collaborator fail to comply with the regulatory\nrequirements in international markets or fail to receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of\nour product candidates will be harmed.\n57\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval and become products, they will be subject to significant post-marketing regulatory requirements and oversight.\nAny regulatory approvals that we may receive for our product candidates will require the submission of reports to regulatory authorities and surveillance to monitor the safety\nand efficacy of the products, may contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, and may include\nburdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. For example, the FDA may require a REMS in order to approve our product candidates, which could entail\nrequirements for a medication guide, physician training and communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient\nregistries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA, the EMA or foreign regulatory authorities approve our product candidates, the manufacturing processes,\nlabeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for our product candidates will be subject to\nextensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as on-\ngoing compliance with cGMPs and GCP for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to\ncontinual review and periodic, unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations and standards. If we or a regulatory\nagency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facilities where the product\nis manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the\nmarket or suspension of manufacturing. In addition, failure to comply with FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory requirements may subject our company to\nadministrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n● delays in or the rejection of product approvals;\n● restrictions on our ability to conduct clinical trials, including full or partial clinical holds on ongoing or planned trials;\n● restrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing process;\n● warning or untitled letters;\n● civil and criminal penalties;\n● injunctions;\n● suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n● product seizures, detentions or import bans;\n● voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n● total or partial suspension of production; and\n● imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue and could require us to expend\nsignificant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity.\nThe FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval\nof our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to\nmaintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United\nStates or abroad. For example, certain policies of the current U.S. administration may impact our business and industry. Namely, the previous U.S. administration took several\nexecutive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA’s ability to engage\nin routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It is\ndifficult to predict whether or how these executive actions, including the Executive Orders, will be implemented, or whether they will be rescinded or replaced under the new\nU.S. administration. If these executive actions impose constraints on FDA’s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may\nbe negatively impacted.\n58\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved and we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses of those products, we may become subject to significant liability.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for\nuses that are not approved by the FDA, the EMA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product’s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for a\nproduct candidate, physicians may nevertheless prescribe it to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-\nlabel uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The U.S. federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper\npromotion of off-label use and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The government has also required companies to enter into consent decrees\nor imposed permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If we cannot successfully manage the promotion of our product\ncandidates, if approved, we could become subject to significant liability, which would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may face difficulties from changes to current regulations and future legislation.\nExisting regulatory policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product\ncandidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United\nStates or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain\nregulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nFor example, the ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. biopharmaceutical\nindustry. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare\npayments and may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, all of which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product\ncandidates, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations.\nThere have also been several changes and challenges to the 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications\nsold to certain health care facilities. It is unclear how these developments could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our future product candidate and affect the rates\nwe may charge such facilities for our approved product candidates in the future, if any.\nMoreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in recent years over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has\nresulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product\npricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical\nproducts. The U.S. Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.\nFurther, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain\ninvestigational new product candidates that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances,\neligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation\nfor a drug manufacturer to make its products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional\ndownward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product candidates. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result\nin a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to\ngenerate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for biotechnology products. We cannot\nbe sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on\nthe marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by Congress of the FDA’s approval process may significantly delay or prevent\nmarketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\n59\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection for our product candidates, proprietary technologies\nand their uses to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. If we or our licensors are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual\nproperty rights are inadequate for our technology or our product candidates, our competitive position could be harmed. We and our licensors generally seek to protect our\nproprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our product candidates, proprietary technologies and their uses that are important to\nour business. Our in-licensed patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless, and until, patents issue\nfrom such applications, and then only to the extent the issued claims cover the technology. There can be no assurance that our in-licensed patent applications will result in\npatents being issued or that issued patents will afford sufficient protection against competitors with similar technology, nor can there be any assurance that the patents if issued\nwill not be infringed, designed around, invalidated or rendered unenforceable by third parties. Even issued patents may later be found invalid or unenforceable or may be\nmodified or revoked in proceedings instituted by third parties before various patent offices or in courts. The degree of future protection for our and our licensors’ proprietary\nrights is uncertain. Only limited protection may be available and may not adequately protect our or our licensors’ rights or permit us or our licensors to gain or keep any\ncompetitive advantage. These uncertainties and/or limitations in our and our licensors’ ability to properly protect the intellectual property rights relating to our product\ncandidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we may in-license issued patents in the United States and foreign countries, we cannot be certain that the claims in our other in-licensed U.S. pending patent\napplications, corresponding international patent applications and patent applications in certain foreign countries will be considered patentable by the United States Patent and\nTrademark Office, or USPTO, courts in the United States or by the patent offices and courts in foreign countries, nor can we be certain that the claims in our in-licensed issued\npatents will not be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged.\nThe patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or our licensors or any of our potential future collaborators\nwill be successful in protecting our product candidates by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n● the USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during\nthe patent process, the noncompliance with which can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, and partial or complete loss of patent rights in\nthe relevant jurisdiction;\n● patent applications may not result in any patents being issued;\n● patents may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;\n● the degree and range of protection any issued patents will afford us against competitors, including whether third parties will find ways to invalidate or otherwise\ncircumvent our patents;\n● whether others will apply for or obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications;\n● whether the patent applications that we own or in-license will result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates or uses thereof in the United States\nor in other foreign countries;\n● our competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources than we or our licensors do and many of whom have made significant investments in competing\ntechnologies, may seek or may have already obtained patents that will limit, interfere with or block our ability to make, use and sell our product candidates;\n60\n● there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the\nUnited States for disease treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and\n● countries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better\nopportunity to create, develop and market competing products.\nThe patent prosecution process is also expensive and time-consuming, and we or our licensors may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent\napplications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous. It is also possible that we or our licensors\nmay not identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we do not have\nthe right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, directed to technology that we license, including those from our\nlicensors and from third parties. We also may require the cooperation of our licensors in order to enforce the licensed patent rights, and such cooperation may not be provided.\nTherefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. We cannot be certain that patent\nprosecution and maintenance activities by our licensors have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which may affect the validity and\nenforceability of such patents or any patents that may issue from such applications. If they fail to do so, this could cause us to lose rights in any applicable intellectual property\nthat we in-license, and as a result our ability to develop and commercialize products or product candidates may be adversely affected and we may be unable to prevent\ncompetitors from making, using and selling competing products.\nComposition of matter patents for biological and pharmaceutical products such as cell therapy product candidates often provide a strong form of intellectual property protection\nfor those types of products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. We cannot be certain, however, that the claims in our pending patent\napplications covering the composition of matter of our product candidates will be considered patentable by the USPTO, or by patent offices in foreign countries, or that the\nclaims in any of our issued patents will be considered valid and enforceable by courts in the United States or foreign countries. Method of use patents protect the use of a\nproduct for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is\noutside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these\nproducts “off-label” for those uses that are covered by our method of use patents. Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method of\nuse patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.\nIn addition, although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to patentable aspects of our research and development output,\nsuch as our employees, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, third-party manufacturers, consultants, advisors, licensors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach\nsuch agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection.\nIf the scope of any patent protection our licensors obtain is not sufficiently broad, or if our licensors lose any of the patent protection we license, our ability to prevent our\ncompetitors from commercializing similar or identical product candidates would be adversely affected.\nThe patent position of biopharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has been the subject of much litigation in\nrecent years. As a result, the existence, issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our in-licensed patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and\nfuture in-licensed patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our product candidates or that effectively prevent others from commercializing\ncompetitive product candidates.\nMoreover, the scope of claims in a patent application can be significantly reduced before any claims in a patent is issued, and claim scope can be reinterpreted after issuance.\nEven if patent applications we license currently or in the future issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent\ncompetitors or other third parties from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Any patents that we license may be challenged or\ncircumvented by third parties or may be narrowed or invalidated as a result of challenges by third parties. Consequently, we do not know whether our product candidates will be\nprotectable or remain protected by valid and enforceable patents. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or\nalternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n61\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our licensed-in patents may not cover our product candidates or may be\nchallenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. We may be subject to a third party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become\ninvolved in opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, post-grant review, or PGR, and inter partes review, or IPR, or other similar proceedings in the USPTO or foreign\npatent offices challenging our patent rights. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to validity of our in-\nlicensed patents, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we or our licensors and the patent examiner were unaware during\nprosecution. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our in-licensed patents and patent applications or those of our licensors has been found. There\nis also no assurance that there is not prior art of which we or licensors are aware, but which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a claim in our patents and\npatent applications or those of our licensors, which may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a claim. An adverse determination in any\nsuch submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate or render unenforceable, our in-licensed patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our\nproduct candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us. Such loss of licensed patent rights, loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated\nor held unenforceable could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent\nprotection of our product candidates. Such proceedings also may result in substantial cost and require significant time from our scientists and management, even if the eventual\noutcome is favorable to us. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it could\ndissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nWe may not identify relevant third-party patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a third-party patent, which might adversely affect our\nability to develop and market our product candidates.\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our patent searches or analyses, including the identification of relevant patents, the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents,\nare complete or thorough, nor can we be certain that we have identified each and every third-party patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is\nrelevant to or necessary for the commercialization of our product candidates in any jurisdiction. The scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the\nwritten disclosure in a patent and the patent’s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which\nmay negatively impact our ability to market our products. We may incorrectly determine that our products are not covered by a third-party patent or may incorrectly predict\nwhether a third-party’s pending application will issue with claims of relevant scope. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that\nwe consider relevant may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product candidates. Our failure to identify and correctly interpret\nrelevant patents may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product candidates.\nOne aspect of the determination of patentability of our inventions depends on the scope and content of the “prior art,” information that was or is deemed available to a person of\nskill in the relevant art prior to the priority date of the claimed invention. There may be prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the patentability of our patent claims\nor, if issued, affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim. Further, we may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product\ncandidates or their intended uses, and as a result the impact of such third-party intellectual property rights upon the patentability of our own patents and patent applications, as\nwell as the impact of such third-party intellectual property upon our freedom to operate, is highly uncertain. Because patent applications in the United States and most other\ncountries are confidential for typically a period of 18 months after filing, or may not be published at all, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application\nrelated to our product candidates. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Furthermore, for U.S.\napplications in which all claims are entitled to a priority date before March 16, 2013, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party or instituted by the USPTO to\ndetermine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. For U.S. applications containing a claim not entitled to priority\nbefore March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law in view of the passage of the America Invents Act, which brought into effect significant changes\nto the U.S. patent laws, including new procedures for challenging pending patent applications and issued patents.\n62\nOur patents or pending patent applications may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. For example, we may be subject to a third-party\npre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or become involved in PGR procedures, oppositions, derivations, reexaminations or IPR proceedings, in the United States or\nelsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims\nbeing narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical\ntechnology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. In addition, given the amount of time required for the development,\ntesting and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. Any\nfailure to obtain or maintain patent protection with respect to our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects.\nIn the future, some of our intellectual property may be discovered through government-funded programs and thus may be subject to federal regulations such as “march-\nin” rights, certain reporting requirements and a preference for U.S.-based companies. Compliance with such regulations may limit our exclusive rights and limit our\nability to contract with non-U.S. manufacturers.\nSome of the intellectual property rights we may acquire or license in the future may be generated through the use of U.S. government funding and may therefore be subject to\ncertain federal regulations. These U.S. government rights may include retained rights in the intellectual property, including a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable\nworldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government may have the right, under certain limited circumstances, to require us to\ngrant exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that: (i) adequate steps have not been taken to\ncommercialize the invention; (ii) government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (iii) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public\nuse under federal regulations (also referred to as “march-in rights”). The U.S. government may also have the right to take title to these inventions if the grant recipient fails to\ndisclose the invention to the government or fails to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. Intellectual property generated under a\ngovernment funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may require us to expend substantial resources. In addition, the U.S.\ngovernment requires that any products embodying any of these inventions or produced through the use of any of these inventions be manufactured substantially in the United\nStates. This preference for U.S. industry may be waived by the federal agency that provided the funding if the owner or assignee of the intellectual property can show that\nreasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United\nStates or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. This preference for U.S. industry may limit our ability to contract with non-U.S.\nproduct manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property. To the extent any of our future intellectual property is also generated through the use of U.S.\ngovernment funding, the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act may similarly apply.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our\nbusiness or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:\n● others may be able to develop products that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license;\n● we or our licensors or future collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we\nown or license;\n● we or our licensors or future collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n63\n● others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n● it is possible that our licensors’ pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n● issued patents that we own or license may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n● our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such\nactivities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n● we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n● we cannot predict the scope of protection of any patent issuing based on our patent applications, including whether the patent applications that we own or in-license\nwill result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates or uses thereof in the United States or in other foreign countries;\n● the claims of any patent issuing based on our patent applications may not provide protection against competitors or any competitive advantages, or may be challenged\nby third parties;\n● if enforced, a court may not hold that our patents are valid, enforceable and infringed;\n● we may need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings to enforce and/or defend our patent rights which will be costly whether we win or lose;\n● we may choose not to file a patent application in order to maintain certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent application and\nobtain an issued patent covering such intellectual property;\n● we may fail to adequately protect and police our trademarks and trade secrets; and\n● the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business, including if others obtain patents claiming subject matter similar to or improving that covered by our\npatents and patent applications.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Claims by third parties\nthat we infringe their proprietary rights may result in liability for damages or prevent or delay our developmental and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. However, our research, development and\ncommercialization activities may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate patents or other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by third parties.\nOther entities may have or obtain patents or proprietary rights that could limit our ability to make, use, sell, offer for sale or import our product candidates and products that\nmay be approved in the future, or impair our competitive position. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and\nother intellectual property rights in the biopharmaceutical industry, including patent infringement lawsuits, oppositions, reexaminations, IPR proceedings and PGR proceedings\nbefore the USPTO and/or foreign patent offices. Numerous third-party U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications exist in the fields in which we are\ndeveloping product candidates. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment\nrelated to the use or manufacture of our product candidates.\nAs the biopharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent\nrights of third parties. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our current product candidates or future products,\nresulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties.\nBecause patent applications are maintained as confidential for a certain period of time, until the relevant application is published, we may be unaware of third-party patents that\nmay be infringed by commercialization of any of our product candidates, and we cannot be certain that we were the first to file a patent application related to a product\ncandidate or technology. Moreover, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued\npatents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, identification of third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our technology is difficult because patent\nsearching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. It is also possible that\npatents owned by third parties of which we are aware, but which we do not believe are relevant to our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop,\ncould be found to be infringed by our product candidate. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these\npatents. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time consuming and could:\n● result in costly litigation that may cause negative publicity;\n64\n● divert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n● cause development delays;\n● prevent us from commercializing any of our product candidates until the asserted patent expires or is held finally invalid or unenforceable or not infringed in a court of\nlaw;\n● require us to develop non-infringing technology, which may not be possible on a cost-effective basis;\n● subject us to significant liability to third parties; or\n● require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or which might be non-exclusive,\nwhich could result in our competitors gaining access to the same technology.\nAlthough, to our knowledge, no third party has asserted a claim of patent infringement against us as of the date of this annual report, others may hold proprietary rights that\ncould prevent our product candidates from being marketed. Any patent-related legal action against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin activities relating to our product\ncandidates or processes could subject us to potential liability for damages, including treble damages if we were determined to willfully infringe, and require us to obtain a\nlicense to manufacture or develop our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a\nsubstantial diversion of management and employee resources from our business. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions or that any license required\nunder any of these patents would be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Moreover, even if we or our future strategic partners were able to obtain a\nlicense, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. In addition, we cannot be certain that we could\nredesign our product candidates or processes to avoid infringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the failure\nto obtain necessary licenses, could prevent us from developing and commercializing our product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating\nresults.\nParties making claims against us may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources or\nmore mature and developed intellectual property portfolios, or both. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual\nproperty litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, any uncertainties\nresulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise have a material adverse\neffect on our business, our ability to compete in the marketplace, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful. Further, our\nin-licensed issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or other intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of our licensors. To cease such infringement or unauthorized use, we\nand/or our licensors may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Further, our licensors may need to file infringement claims, and\nour licensors may elect not to file such claims. Our pending patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications\nunless and until a patent issues from such applications. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent we own or license is not valid, is\nunenforceable and/or is not infringed. If we or any of our licensors or potential future collaborators were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent\ndirected at one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable in whole or in part. In patent litigation, defendant\ncounterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge include an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory\nrequirements, including lack of novelty or written description, obviousness, written description, or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could include an\nallegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent intentionally withheld material information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during\nprosecution.\n65\nIf a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on such product\ncandidate. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will construe the patent’s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to\nstop the other party from using the invention at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover the invention, or decide that the other party’s use of our patented\ntechnology falls under the safe harbor to patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. §271(e)(1). In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent\napplications or those of our licensors is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product\ncandidates. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine\nthat the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in\nquestion. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to our intellectual property rights may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our\ntechnical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the\nresources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such\nlitigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their\ngreater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the\nmarketplace.\nEven if we establish infringement, the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may or\nmay not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or other legal\nproceedings relating to our intellectual property rights, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of\nlitigation or other proceedings.\nIntellectual property litigation may lead to unfavorable publicity that harms our reputation and causes the market price of our common shares to decline.\nDuring the course of any intellectual property litigation, there could be public announcements of the initiation of the litigation as well as results of hearings, rulings on motions,\nand other interim proceedings in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the perceived value of our existing product\ncandidates, programs or intellectual property could be diminished. Such announcements could also harm our reputation or the market for our future product candidates, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDerivation or interference proceedings may be necessary to determine priority of inventions, and an unfavorable outcome may require us to cease using the related\ntechnology or to attempt to license rights from the prevailing party.\nDerivation or interference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or our licensors, or declared by the USPTO or similar proceedings in foreign patent offices\nmay be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to, or correct the inventorship of, our or our licensors’ patents or patent applications. An unfavorable\noutcome could result in a loss of our current patent rights and require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our\nbusiness could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our or our licensors’ defense of such proceedings may fail and,\neven if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with such proceedings could have\na material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third\nparties or enter into development or manufacturing partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\n66\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued\npatents.\nIn September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act could increase uncertainties and costs surrounding\nthe prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent\nlaw. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, and provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors to\nchallenge the validity of patents. In particular, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned in March 2013 to a “first inventor to file” system in which, assuming\nthat other requirements of patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent regardless of whether a third party was first to invent\nthe claimed invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after March 2013 but before we file an application covering the same invention, could therefore\nbe awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by such third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward\nof the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Furthermore, our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences\nbetween our technology and the prior art allow our technology to be patentable over the prior art. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are\nconfidential for a period of time after filing or until issuance, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our\nproduct candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our or our licensors’ patents or patent applications. Even\nwhere we have a valid and enforceable patent, we may not be able to exclude others from practicing the claimed invention where the other party can show that they used the\ninvention in commerce before our filing date or the other party benefits from a compulsory license.\nThe Leahy-Smith Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These\ninclude allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered\npost-grant proceedings, including PGR, IPR, and derivation proceedings. An adverse determination in any such submission or proceeding could reduce the scope or\nenforceability of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nBecause of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a\nthird party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to\ninvalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would\nnot have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. Thus, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the\nuncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our or licensors’ patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in U.S. patent law, or laws in other countries, could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the\nbiopharmaceutical industry involves a high degree of technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time-\nconsuming and inherently uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability\nto protect our inventions, obtain, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights, and, more generally, could affect the value of our intellectual property and may increase\nthe uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that\nmay be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. In addition, Congress or other foreign legislative bodies may pass patent reform legislation that is\nunfavorable to us or narrows the scope of our owned and licensed patents.\n67\nFor example, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or\nweakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our or our licensors’ ability to obtain patents in the future, this\ncombination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. federal courts, the\nUSPTO, or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our or our licensors’\nability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents we might obtain in the future. We cannot predict how future decisions by Congress, the federal courts\nor the USPTO may impact the value of our patents.\nWe or our licensors may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our or our in-licensed patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an ownership interest in our in-licensed patents or other intellectual property\nas an inventor or co-inventor. The failure to name the proper inventors on a patent application can result in the patents issuing thereon being unenforceable. Inventorship\ndisputes may arise from conflicting views regarding the contributions of different individuals named as inventors, the effects of foreign laws where foreign nationals are\ninvolved in the development of the subject matter of the patent, conflicting obligations of third parties involved in developing our product candidates or as a result of questions\nregarding co-ownership of potential joint inventions. For example, we may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are\ninvolved in developing our product candidates. Alternatively, or additionally, we may enter into agreements to clarify the scope of our rights in such intellectual property.\nLitigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we or our licensors fail in defending any such claims, in addition\nto paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership or a right to use. Such an outcome could have a material adverse\neffect on our business. Even if we or our licensors are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management\nand other employees.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute\nagreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual\nproperty that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be\nforced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Such\nclaims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after its first effective filing\ndate. Various extensions may be available, but the term of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents directed to our product candidates are obtained, once\nthe patent term has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review\nof product candidates, patents directed to our product candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may\nnot provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. In addition, although upon issuance in the United States a\npatent’s life can be increased based on certain delays caused by the USPTO, this increase can be reduced or eliminated based on certain delays caused by the patent applicant\nduring patent prosecution.\n68\nIf we or our licensors do not obtain patent term extension for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval, if any, of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited\npatent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch- Waxman Amendments\npermit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. A maximum of\none patent may be extended per FDA-approved product as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot\nextend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for\nusing it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Patent term extension may also be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product\ncandidates. However, we or our licensors may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to\nexpiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be\nless than we request. If we or our licensors are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors\nmay obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may\ntake advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the\ncase. If we do not have sufficient patent life to protect our products, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nAlthough we have in-licensed pending patent applications in the United States and certain other countries, filing, prosecuting and defending patents in all countries throughout\nthe world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United\nStates. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state\nlaws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our in-licensed inventions in all countries outside the United States or from\nselling or importing products made using our in-licensed inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our in-licensed technologies in\njurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we or our\nlicensors have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates, and our or our licensors\npatents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of many foreign\ncountries do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult in those jurisdictions for us to stop the\ninfringement or misappropriation of our or our licensors’ patents or other intellectual property rights, or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights.\nProceedings to enforce our or our licensors’ patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our\nbusiness, could put our or our licensors’ patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and our or our licensors’ patent applications at risk of\nnot issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We or our licensors may not prevail in any lawsuits that we or our licensors initiate, and the damages or\nother remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Similarly, if our trade secrets are disclosed in a foreign jurisdiction, competitors worldwide could have\naccess to our proprietary information and we may be without satisfactory recourse. Such disclosure could have a material adverse effect on our business. Accordingly, our or\nour licensors’ efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property\nthat we develop or license.\nIn addition, certain countries, including China and India, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In\nthose countries, we and our licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third-party, which could\nmaterially diminish the value of those patents. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these\ncountries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or our licensors are forced to grant a license to third\nparties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects\nmay be adversely affected.\n69\nBecause of the expense and uncertainty of litigation in certain foreign jurisdictions, we may conclude that even if a third-party is infringing our issued patents, any patents that\nmay be issued as a result of our pending or future patent applications or other intellectual property rights, the risk-adjusted cost of bringing and enforcing such a claim or action,\nwhich typically last for years before they are concluded, may be too high or not in the best interest of our company or our stockholders, or it may be otherwise impractical or\nundesirable to enforce our intellectual property against some third parties. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation or\nproceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. In such cases, we may\ndecide that the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result\nof the proceedings and that the more prudent course of action is to simply monitor the situation or initiate or seek some other non-litigious action or solution. In addition, the\nuncertainties associated with litigation could compromise our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our internal research programs, in-\nlicense needed technology or other product candidates, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by\nregulations and governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to the USPTO and various foreign patent\noffices at various points over the lifetime of our patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we rely on third parties to pay these\nfees when due. Additionally, the USPTO and various foreign patent offices require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar\nprovisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be\ncured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with rules applicable to the particular jurisdiction. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can\nresult in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If such an event were to occur,\nit could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by other types of intellectual property, we rely on the protection of our trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and\nother proprietary information to maintain our competitive position. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into\nconfidentiality agreements with third parties (including, but not limited to, contractors, collaborators, and outside scientific advisors), and confidential information and\ninventions agreements with employees, consultants, licensors and advisors, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and any of\nthese parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such\nbreaches. We require our employees to enter into written confidentiality agreements that assign to us any inventions, developments, creative works and useful ideas of any\ndescription that are conceived of, reduced to practice or developed in the course of their employment. In addition, we require our third-party contractors to enter into a written\nnon-disclosure agreement that requires the third party to not disclose certain of our confidential information in any manner or for any purpose other than as necessary and/or\nappropriate in connection with their obligations for a defined period of time, subject to certain exclusions. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a\ntrade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or\nunwilling to protect trade secrets. We may need to share our proprietary information, including trade secrets, with our current and future business partners, collaborators,\ncontractors and others located in countries at heightened risk of theft of trade secrets, including through direct intrusion by private parties or foreign actors, and those affiliated\nwith or controlled by state actors.\nMoreover, third parties may still obtain this information or may come upon this or similar information independently, and we would have no right to prevent them from using\nthat technology or information to compete with us. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets, the value of this information may be\ngreatly reduced and our competitive position would be harmed. If we or our licensors do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication or if we cannot otherwise\nmaintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret\ninformation may be jeopardized.\n70\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential\ninformation or trade secrets of their former employers.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nAs is common in the biopharmaceutical industry, in addition to our employees, we engage the services of consultants to assist us in the development of our product candidates.\nMany of these consultants, and many of our employees, were previously employed at, or may have previously provided or may be currently providing consulting services to,\nother biopharmaceutical companies including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims that we, our employees, independent contractors, or\nconsultants inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other information proprietary to their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation\nmay be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property\nrights or personnel, which could adversely affect our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a\ndistraction to our management team and other employees.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be\nadversely affected.\nOur current or future trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, or declared generic or descriptive or determined to be infringing on other marks.\nWe may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names, which we need for name recognition by potential\npartners or customers in our markets of interest. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections of our applications by the USPTO or in other foreign\njurisdictions. Although we would be given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in\ncomparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks.\nOpposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. If we are unable to establish name\nrecognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. We may license our trademarks\nand trade names to third parties, such as distributors. Though these license agreements may provide guidelines for how our trademarks and trade names may be used, a breach\nof these agreements or misuse of our trademarks and tradenames by our licensees may jeopardize our rights in or diminish the goodwill associated with our trademarks and\ntrade names.\nMoreover, any name we have proposed to use with product candidates in the United States may need FDA approval, regardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to\nregister it, as a trademark. Similar requirements exist in Europe. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for\nconfusion with other product names. If the FDA (or an equivalent administrative body in a foreign jurisdiction) objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we\nmay be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the\nexisting rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. Furthermore, in many countries, owning and maintaining a trademark registration may not provide an adequate\ndefense against a subsequent infringement claim asserted by the owner of a senior trademark. At times, competitors or other third parties may adopt trade names or trademarks\nsimilar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark\ninfringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. If\nwe assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted\ntrademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.\n71\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing our Growth\nIf we are unable to establish sales or marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell or market our product candidates, we may not be able to\nsuccessfully sell or market our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval.\nWe currently do not have and have never had a marketing or sales team. In order to commercialize any product candidates, if approved, we must build marketing, sales,\ndistribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for each of the territories in which we may have\napproval to sell or market our product candidates. We may not be successful in accomplishing these required tasks.\nEstablishing an internal sales or marketing team with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize our product candidates will be expensive and\ntime-consuming, and will require significant attention of our executive officers to manage. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and\ndistribution capabilities could adversely impact the commercialization of any of our product candidates that we obtain approval to market, if we do not have arrangements in\nplace with third parties to provide such services on our behalf. Alternatively, if we choose to collaborate, either globally or on a territory-by-territory basis, with third parties\nthat have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and\ndistribution systems, we will be required to negotiate and enter into arrangements with such third parties relating to the proposed collaboration. If we are unable to enter into\nsuch arrangements when needed, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory\napproval, or any such commercialization may experience delays or limitations. If we are unable to successfully commercialize our approved product candidates, either on our\nown or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we may incur significant additional losses.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled executive officers and employees.\nTo succeed, we must recruit, retain, manage and motivate qualified clinical, scientific, technical and management personnel, and we face significant competition for\nexperienced personnel. We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific and medical staff. If we do not succeed in attracting and retaining\nqualified personnel, particularly at the management level, it could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. In particular, the loss\nof one or more of our executive officers could be detrimental to us if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. The competition for qualified personnel in the\nbiotechnology field is intense and as a result, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the future success of our business. We could\nin the future have difficulty attracting experienced personnel to our company and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and\nretention efforts.\nMany of the other biotechnology companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer\nhistory in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better prospects for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more\nappealing to high-quality candidates than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can\ndiscover, develop and commercialize our product candidates will be limited and the potential for successfully growing our business will be harmed.\nIn order to successfully implement our plans and strategies, we will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had ten full-time employees. In order to successfully implement our development and commercialization plans and strategies, we expect to need\nadditional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other personnel. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management,\nincluding:\n● identifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining and motivating additional employees;\n● managing our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical, FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory agencies’ review process of our\nproduct candidates and any other product candidate we develop, while complying with any contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties we may have;\nand\n● improving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\n72\nOur future financial performance and our ability to successfully develop and, if approved, commercialize any of our current product candidates and any other product candidate\nwe may develop will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth, and our management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of its\nattention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities.\nWe currently rely, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain independent organizations, advisors and consultants to provide certain\nservices, including key aspects of clinical development and manufacturing. We cannot assure you that the services of independent organizations, advisors and consultants will\ncontinue to be available to us on a timely basis when needed, or that we can find qualified replacements. In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced\nactivities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by third party service providers is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or\nterminated, and we may not be able to obtain marketing approval of any current or future product candidates or otherwise advance our business. We cannot assure you that we\nwill be able to manage our existing third party service providers or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and/or engaging additional third party service providers, we may not be able to successfully\nimplement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize our product candidates and any future product candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve our research,\ndevelopment and commercialization goals.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market may not develop or continue to be liquid and the market price of shares of our common stock may be volatile.\nOur common stock is listed and traded on Nasdaq. Prior to the listing on Nasdaq, there has not been a public market for any of our securities, and an active market for our\ncommon stock may not develop or be sustained, which could depress the market price of shares of our common stock and could affect the ability of our stockholders to sell our\ncommon stock. In the absence of an active public trading market, investors may not be able to liquidate their investments in our common stock. An inactive market may also\nimpair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, our ability to motivate our employees through equity incentive awards and our ability to acquire other\ncompanies, products or technologies by using shares of our common stock as consideration.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade on Nasdaq, and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nFurthermore, because of our novel listing process on Nasdaq, Nasdaq’s rules for ensuring compliance with its initial listing standards, such as those requiring a valuation or\nother compelling evidence of value, are untested. In the absence of a prior active public trading market for our common stock, if the price of our common stock or our market\ncapitalization falls below those required by Nasdaq’s eligibility standards, we may not be able to satisfy the ongoing listing criteria and may be required to delist.\nIn addition, because of our novel listing process, individual investors, retail or otherwise, may have greater influence in setting the public prices of our common stock on\nNasdaq and may participate more in our trading than is typical for a firm-commitment underwritten initial public offering. These factors could result in a public price of our\ncommon stock that is higher than other investors (such as institutional investors) are willing to pay, which could cause volatility in the trading price of our common stock and\nan unsustainable trading price if the price of our common stock significantly rises and institutional investors believe our common stock is worth less than retail investors, in\nwhich case the price of our common stock may decline over time. Further, if the public price of our common stock is above the level that investors determine is reasonable for\nour common stock, some investors may attempt to short our common stock, which would create additional downward pressure on the public price of our common stock. To the\nextent that there is a lack of consumer awareness among retail investors, such a lack of consumer awareness could reduce the value of our common stock and cause volatility in\nthe trading price of our common stock.\n73\nThe public price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the risk factors described in this annual report and others beyond our control,\nincluding:\n● changes in the industries in which we operate;\n● variations in our operating performance and the performance of our competitors in general;\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n● publication of research reports by securities analysts about us or our competitors or our industry;\n● the public’s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n● our failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analysts’ projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market;\n● additions and departures of key personnel;\n● changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n● commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n● changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n● the volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale; and\n● general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, foreign currency fluctuations, international tariffs, social, political and\neconomic risks and acts of war or terrorism.\nIn addition, securities exchanges have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many\ncompanies. Stock prices of many companies have fluctuated in a manner often unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. These fluctuations may be even\nmore pronounced in the trading market for our common stock following the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq as a result of the supply and demand forces described\nabove. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it\ncould subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture sales of common stock by our Registered Stockholders and other existing stockholders could cause our share price to decline.\nOur common stock is listed and traded on Nasdaq. Prior to listing on Nasdaq, there has been no public market for our common stock and there has not been a sustained history\nof trading in our common stock in “over-the-counter” markets. While our common stock may be sold on Nasdaq by the registered stockholders or by our other existing\nstockholders in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act, there can be no assurance that any registered stockholders or other existing stockholders will sell any of\ntheir shares of common stock and there may be a lack of supply of, or demand for, common stock on Nasdaq. There can be no assurance that the Registered Stockholders and\nother existing stockholders will not sell all of their shares of common stock, resulting in an oversupply of our common stock on Nasdaq. In the case of a lack of supply of our\ncommon stock, the trading price of our common stock may rise to an unsustainable level. Further, institutional investors may be discouraged from purchasing our common\nstock if they are unable to purchase a block of our common stock in the open market due to a potential unwillingness of our existing stockholders to sell a sufficient amount of\ncommon stock at the price offered by such institutional investors and the greater influence individual investors have in setting the trading price. If institutional investors are\nunable to purchase our common stock, the market for our common stock may be more volatile without the influence of long-term institutional investors holding significant\namounts of our common stock. In the case of a lack of market demand for our common stock, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly and rapidly\nafter our listing. Therefore, an active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock may not initially develop or be sustained, which could significantly depress the\npublic price of our common stock and/or result in significant volatility, which could affect your ability to sell your shares of common stock.\n74\nWe have 2,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock with super voting rights.\nOur capital stock as of the date hereof consists of voting common stock (which we sometimes refer to herein as “common stock”), and Series C Preferred Stock. Our board of\ndirectors and stockholders have each approved the creation and issuance of an aggregate of 2,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, all of which Series C Preferred Stock were\nissued in January 2024 to Pete O’Heeron, our founder and Chief Executive Officer.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock (i) have no dividend rights, (ii) convert into common stock upon any transfer from the initial holder, (iii) have a liquidation preference of $18.00\nper share (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock split, combination, or other similar recapitalization) upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up and\n(iv) are entitled to 13,000 votes for each share of Series C Preferred Stock.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock are subject to an irrevocable proxy issued by Pete O’Heeron, the holder of all of the Series C Preferred Stock, in favor and for the benefit of, our\nboard of directors, granting our board of directors the irrevocable proxy, for as long as the Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding, to vote all of the Series C Preferred\nStock on all matters on which the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, in any manner that our board of directors may determine in its sole and absolute discretion;\nprovided, however, that such irrevocable proxy shall not, without the written consent of Pete O’Heeron, permit our board of directors to vote the Series Preferred Stock with\nrespect to any proposal to amend, delete or waive any rights of Pete O’Heeron with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock as set forth in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation. In light of the superior voting rights associated with the Series C Preferred Stock, the irrevocable proxy is intended to ensure that such superior voting rights are\nutilized in our best interest and to avoid or mitigate conflicts that may arise in the future for Pete O’Heeron as an individual stockholder employee.\nIn addition to the dilutive effect on the voting power and value of our common stock, the foregoing structure of our capital stock may render our common stock ineligible for\ninclusion in certain securities market indices, and thus adversely affect the price and liquidity of, and public sentiment regarding, our common stock or other securities. The\nexistence of, and voting rights associated with, our Series C Preferred Stock, either alone or in conjunction with certain of the other provisions of our amended and restated\ncertificate of incorporation, such as the requirement to have a staggered board, could also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in our control or make\nthe removal of our management more difficult.\nWe are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq Stock Market Rules because our insiders beneficially own more than 50% of the voting power of our\noutstanding voting securities.\nOur founder and Chief Executive Officer, Pete O’Heeron, collectively beneficially owns approximately 59% of the voting power of our outstanding voting securities and we are\na “controlled company” within the meaning of the listing rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. We may rely on certain exemptions from corporate governance rules,\nincluding an exemption from the rule that a majority of our board of directors must be independent directors. Although we currently do not intend to rely on the “controlled\ncompany” exemption under the Nasdaq listing rules, we could elect to rely on this exemption in the future. In the event that we elected to rely on the “controlled company”\nexemption, a majority of the members of our board of directors might not be independent directors, and our nominating and corporate governance and compensation\ncommittees might not consist entirely of independent directors. Our status as a controlled company could cause our shares of common stock to be less attractive to certain\ninvestors or otherwise harm our trading price. As a result, you do not have the same protection afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to these corporate\ngovernance requirements.\nYou may be diluted by future issuances of preferred stock or additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise; future sales of\nsuch shares in the public market, or the expectations that such sales may occur, could lower our stock price.\nWe have adopted an amended and restated certificate of incorporation which authorizes us to issue shares of common stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights\nrelating to our common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion. We could issue a significant\nnumber of shares of common stock in the future in connection with investments or acquisitions. Any of these issuances could dilute our existing stockholders, and such dilution\ncould be significant. Moreover, such dilution could have a material adverse effect on the market price for the shares of our common stock.\n75\nThe future issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of shares of our common stock, either by diluting the\nvoting power of our common stock if the preferred stock votes together with the common stock as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right\nto block an action on which they have a separate class vote, even if the action were approved by the holders of our shares of our common stock.\nThe future issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock\ncould adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive. For example, investors in the common stock may\nnot wish to purchase common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively\nbe entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price, causing economic dilution to the holders of common stock.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a\nprice greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development, commercialization and growth of our business, and therefore we do not\nanticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare dividends will be made at the discretion\nof our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our board of\ndirectors may deem relevant. Our future ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock may also be limited by the terms of any future debt securities or credit facility. As a\nresult, capital appreciation, if any, of the common stock you purchase or own will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller\nreporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain\nexemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including (i) not being\nrequired to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) having the option of delaying the adoption of certain new or revised\nfinancial accounting standards, (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this annual report and our periodic reports and proxy statements and\n(iv) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not\npreviously approved. We may take advantage of these exemptions until such time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. Accordingly, the information contained\nherein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. Further, pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, we have\nelected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private\ncompanies. As a result, our operating results and financial statements may not be comparable to the operating results and financial statements of other companies who have\nadopted the new or revised accounting standards.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) December 31, 2028, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at\nleast $1.235 billion, (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would\noccur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates was $700.0 million or more as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year or (iv) the\ndate on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\n76\nWe are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging\ngrowth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies until the fiscal year following the determination that our\nvoting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is $250 million or more measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenues are\nless than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is $700 million or more measured on\nthe last business day of our second fiscal quarter.\nIt is possible that some investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of the foregoing, which may result in a less active trading market for our common stock\nand higher volatility in our stock price.\nOur management and principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder\napproval.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our executive officers, directors and five percent or greater stockholders and their respective affiliates, beneficially own, in the aggregate,\napproximately 19% of our outstanding common stock on an as converted basis. To the extent that the same group continue to own a significant percentage of our common\nstock, these stockholders, if they act together, will be able to control the management and affairs of our company and most matters requiring stockholder approval, including the\nelection of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and approval of any merger, sale of substantially all our assets or other significant corporate transactions.\nThis concentration of ownership may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you or other stockholders may feel are in your\nor their best interest as one of our stockholders.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, in each case, may delay or prevent a take-over that may not be in the best interests of our\nstockholders.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, in each case, may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects, which include, among others, (i) the\nexistence of our Series C Preferred Stock entitled to 13,000 votes per share of Series C Preferred Stock, as more particularly described elsewhere in this annual report, (ii) a\nclassified board of directors serving staggered three-year terms, (iii) who can fill vacancies of our board of directors, (iv) supermajority voting thresholds for the removal of\nmembers of our board, and (v) when and by whom special meetings of our stockholders may be called, and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock which will have such rights and preferences\ndetermined from time to time by our board of directors. Following the adoption of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors may, without\nstockholder approval (except as may be required under Nasdaq rules), issue additional preferred shares with dividends, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could\nadversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. Further, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will authorize the issuance\nof “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a “poison pill”).\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, in each case, will provide for an exclusive forum in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for certain\ndisputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or\nemployees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, in each case, will provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (i) the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent\npermitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary\nduty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (c) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the\nState of Delaware, or the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine and (ii) to the fullest\nextent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause or causes of\naction arising under the Securities Act, including all causes of action asserted against any defendant to such complaint. Pursuant to our planned amended and restated certificate\nof incorporation, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our common stock will be deemed to have had notice of and\nconsented to the forum selection clause in our planned amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in this paragraph.\n77\nThe foregoing provision would not preclude stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in federal court, to the extent that the Exchange\nAct confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over such claims, subject to applicable law.\nWe believe our choice of forum provision may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law by chancellors and judges particularly\nexperienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-\nforum litigation. However, our choice of forum provision may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in pursuing claims and may limit a stockholder’s ability to\nbring a claim in a judicial forum that it believes to be favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with\nrespect to such claims. In addition, while the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to\nbring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the choice of forum provision, and there can be no assurance that such provision will be enforced by a court in those\nother jurisdictions. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur\nadditional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nGeneral Risks\nReports published by analysts, including projections in those reports that differ from our actual results, could adversely affect the price and trading volume of our common\nstock.\nSecurities research analysts may establish and publish their own periodic projections for our Company. These projections may vary widely and may not accurately predict the\nresults we actually achieve. The price of our common stock may decline if our actual results do not match the projections of these securities research analysts. Similarly, if one\nor more of the analysts who write reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one\nor more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of any of our CROs, manufacturers, other contractors, consultants, collaborators or potential future collaborators, may fail or\nsuffer security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data or\npersonal data, which could result in additional costs, loss of revenue, significant liabilities, harm to our brand and material disruption of our operations.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future CROs and other contractors, consultants, collaborators\nand third-party service providers, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, cybersecurity threats, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and\ntelecommunication and electrical failure. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and often are not recognized\nuntil launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that\nmay remain undetected for an extended period. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations or result in the unauthorized acquisition of or access to\npersonally identifiable information or individually identifiable health information (violating certain privacy laws such as HIPAA and GDPR), it could result in a material\ndisruption of our drug discovery and development programs and our business operations, whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other similar disruptions. Some of the\nfederal, state and foreign government requirements include obligations of companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving particular personally identifiable\ninformation, which could result from breaches experienced by us or by our vendors, contractors or organizations with which we have formed strategic relationships.\nNotifications and follow-up actions related to a security breach could impact our reputation, cause us to incur significant costs, including legal expenses and remediation costs.\nFor example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to\nrecover or reproduce the lost data. We also rely on third parties for certain portions of our manufacturing process, and similar events relating to their computer systems could\nalso have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data, or inappropriate\ndisclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could be exposed to litigation and governmental investigations, the further development and commercialization of our\nproduct candidates could be delayed, and we could be subject to significant fines or penalties for any noncompliance with certain state, federal and/or international privacy and\nsecurity laws.\n78\nOur insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the potential losses arising from any such disruption, failure or security breach. In addition, such insurance\nmay not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and could have high\ndeductibles in any event, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management attention.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, severe weather conditions, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist activity and other events beyond our\ncontrol, which could harm our business.\nOur facility is located in a region which experiences severe weather from time to time. We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our\nbusiness and financial results from a major tornado, flood, fire, earthquake, power loss, terrorist activity or other disasters and do not have a recovery plan for such disasters. In\naddition, we do not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for actual losses from interruption of our business that may occur, and any losses or damages incurred by us\ncould harm our business. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have processes for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, which are an integral part of decision-making at every level. Such processes include physical,\nprocedural and technical safeguards, response plans, and routine review of our policies and procedures to identify risks and refine our practices.\nWe have engaged an external Information Technology Managed Service Provider, or IT MSP, to help our management team design, implement and maintain our information\ntechnology systems and infrastructure. Members of our executive leadership team provide oversight of the activities of the IT MSP to ensure appropriate controls. Furthermore,\nthe Audit Committee has oversight with respect to our internal controls and managing the risks of cybersecurity threats.\nGovernance\nOur Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing cybersecurity risk and periodically updates our Board of Directors on such matters. The Audit\nCommittee receives periodic updates from management regarding cybersecurity matters and is notified between such updates regarding any significant new cybersecurity\nthreats or incidents. We do not believe that there are currently any known risks from cybersecurity threats that are reasonably likely to materially affect us or our business\nstrategy, results of operations or financial condition, and have not had previous cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected us.\nItem 2. Properties\nWe lease approximately 23,000 square feet of office space for our headquarters in Houston, Texas. This lease ends in November 2027.\nWe lease approximately 1,600 square feet of office and lab space in Houston, Texas. This lease ends in July 2024.\nWe believe that our leased facilities are adequate to meet our current needs.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time we may be involved in legal proceedings relating to intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters arising in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Such matters are subject to uncertainty and there can be no assurance that such legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, financial position or cash flows. There are no legal proceedings at this time.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n79\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information for Common Stock\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “FBLG”.\nStockholders\nAs of February 20, 2024, we have 32,634.366 shares of common stock outstanding held by 1,170 stockholders of record, and 2,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock held by\none holder of record. The actual number of stockholders is greater than this number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are\nheld in street name by brokers and other nominees. The number of holders of record also does not include stockholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. We\ncurrently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings, if any, to fund the development and expansion of our business. Any future determination related to\ndividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations,\nfinancial condition, contractual restrictions and capital requirements.\nSales of Unregistered Securities\nThere were no sales of unregistered securities by us during the year ended December 31, 2023, that were not previously reported in our Registration on Form S-1 filed with the\nSEC on February 12, 2023.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Parties\nNone.\nItem 6. Reserved\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes and other\nfinancial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report,\nincluding information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many\nfactors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this annual report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by\nthe forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage cell therapy company focused on developing and commercializing fibroblast-based therapies for patients suffering from chronic diseases with significant\nunmet medical needs, including degenerative disc disease, multiple sclerosis, wound healing, and certain cancers, and potential extension of life applications including thymic\nand splenic involution reversal. At present, our novel manufacturing process entails collecting excess tissue from surgical procedures and using the allogeneic fibroblasts to\ngrow a cell bank for use in our procedures. Our most advanced product candidates are CybroCell™ and CYMS101.\n80\nCybroCell™ is an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy for degenerative disc disease and is being designed as an alternative method for repairing the cartilage of the\nintervertebral disc (or any other articular cartilage). We have completed two animal studies. The results from the studies were positive and resulted in “first in human” trial\napproval. We have received IND clearance from the FDA, conditional upon approval of our master cell bank, to run a Phase 1/2 study for patients suffering from degenerative\ndisc disease and will be conducting this study within the United States. A timeline will be determined through discussions with the FDA.\nWe are developing CYMS101 as an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy to treat MS. After completing animal studies using CYMS101 (allogeneic fibroblast cells), we\nreceived approval to conduct clinical investigations in Mexico using the fibroblast cell composition for patients with MS and have completed a Phase 1 study. The study was\nconducted in five participants. The primary objective of the study was to assess safety, and the secondary objective was to assess efficacy. We are currently conducting further\nresearch to determine the mode of action of fibroblasts in oligodendrocyte expansion and expect to file an IND application for a Phase 2 clinical trial in MS. We will likely seek\na strategic partner to collaborate with us on the development of CYMS101 either before initiating the Phase 2 study, or after its completion, if successful, and prior to\ncommencing with a Phase 3 clinical trial.\nWe are in the early stages of developing CYWC628 as an allogeneic fibroblast cell-based therapy for wound healing. Our studies are presently focused on utilizing fibroblasts\nand fibroblast-derived cells to treat wounds in diabetic mice and rats. Based upon our results achieved to date, we plan to pursue an IND submission with the FDA for wound\nhealing as early as 2024.\nWe also have cancer and extension of life programs in the early stages of development, and we plan to accelerate such programs as funding allows.\nWe currently purchase our cell therapy product candidates from a contract development and manufacturing organization, or CDMO. We are in the process of contracting with a\nCDMO for the transfer of our experimental cell bank to produce our master cell bank, working cell bank and our fibroblast cell-based product candidates to enable clinical\ntrials. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we will evaluate the longer-term feasibility of building our own cGMP manufacturing facility or continuing to\noutsource production to a CDMO for clinical testing and commercial sales.\nSince our spinoff from FibroGenesis in April 2021, our operations have included business planning, hiring personnel, raising capital, building our intellectual property portfolio\nand performing research and development on our product candidates and our fibroblast technology, leveraging the clinical benefits of fibroblasts as the basis of our cell therapy\nplatform.\nWe have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities. To date, we have funded our\noperations primarily through investment from FibroGenesis, the sale of $5.6 million of our convertible promissory notes, which were all subsequently converted to equity, the\nsale of $18.6 million of preferred stock, and $1.9 million in proceeds from the sale of common stock through the GEM Capital Stock Purchase Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $9.2 million. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We incurred net\nlosses of approximately $16.5 million and $5.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit\nof approximately $24.4 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the next several years.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase substantially if and as we:\n● advance the development of our lead product candidates through clinical development, and, if approved by the FDA, commercialization;\n81\n● advance our preclinical development programs into clinical development;\n● incur manufacturing costs for cell production to supply our product candidates;\n● seek regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n● increase our research and development activities to identify and develop new product candidates;\n● hire additional personnel;\n● expand our operational, financial and management systems;\n● meet the requirements and demands of being a public company;\n● invest in further development to protect and expand our intellectual property;\n● establish a sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval and\nintend to commercialize; and\n● expand our manufacturing and develop our commercialization efforts.\nDue to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biopharmaceutical product development and the economic and developmental uncertainty, we may be unable to\naccurately predict the timing or magnitude of all expenses. Our ability to ultimately generate revenue to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the development, approval,\nand subsequent commercialization of our product candidates. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable\nto continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nAs a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our long-term continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate\nsignificant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, which may include\ncollaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may not be able to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when\nneeded on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we will have to significantly delay, reduce or eliminate the\ndevelopment and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If our\ndevelopment efforts for any of our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. We cannot\npredict if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. We may never succeed in obtaining\nregulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates and include:\n● employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation for our research and development personnel;\n82\n● laboratory equipment and supplies;\n● direct third-party costs such as expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and CMOs;\n● consultants that conduct research and development activities on our behalf;\n● costs associated with conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n● costs associated with technology; and\n● facilities and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and other facility related costs and other supplies.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research\nand development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to\ndeveloping our product candidates as they advance into later stages of clinical development and our other product candidates in preclinical development as they advance into\nclinical development. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and the successful development of\nour product candidates is highly uncertain. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to\nwhat extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with\ndeveloping product candidates, including uncertainty related to:\n● the duration, costs and timing of clinical trials of our current development programs and any further clinical trials related to new product candidates;\n● the sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n● the acceptance of IND applications for future clinical trials;\n● the successful and timely enrollment and completion of clinical trials;\n● the successful completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n● successful data from our clinical program that supports an acceptable risk-benefit profile of our product candidates in the intended populations;\n● the receipt and maintenance of regulatory and marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n● establishing agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply for our clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if any of our product candidates are\napproved;\n● the entry into collaborations to further the development of our product candidates;\n● obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; and\n● successfully launching our product candidates and achieving commercial sales, if and when approved.\n83\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our programs or any product candidate we develop would significantly change the\ncosts, timing and viability associated with the development and/or regulatory approval of such programs or product candidates.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses\nOur general, administrative, and other expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, allocated facilities costs, and other expenses for outside professional services, including\nlegal, marketing, investor relations, human resources services, and accounting services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our\ngeneral and administrative personnel. We expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the\nrules and regulations of the SEC, Nasdaq, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. We also expect to\nincrease the size of our administrative function to support the growth of our business.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense consists primarily of accrued interest expense and amortization of discount on our convertible notes.\nStatements of Operations\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Fiscal Years December 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFiscal Year Ended\nDecember 31, Change Amount\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 2,368 $ 1,147 $ 1,221\nGeneral, administrative and other 6,521 3,320 3,201\nTotal operating expenses 8,889 4,467 4,422\nLoss from operations (8,889) (4,467) (4,422)\nChange in fair value of liability instrument (7,236) (7,236)\nOther (loss) (213) — (213)\nInterest expense (147) (654) 507\nNet loss $ (16,485) $ (5,121) $ (11,364)\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses were $2.4 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase of $1.3 million was\nprimarily due to:\n● increased personnel related expenses of $0.8 million due to hiring a net four additional research scientists during 2023 and increased stock compensation expense in\n2023 resulting from stock option grants.\n● increased research supplies of $0.2 million due to increased laboratory personnel and preclinical studies; and\n● increased research facility and equipment depreciation costs of $0.1 million due to increased personnel and costs associated with moving to a new rented lab facility.\n84\nResearch and development expenses are not tracked by product candidate.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses\nGeneral, administrative and other expenses were $6.5 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase of $3.2 million was\nprimarily due to:\n● increased personnel-related expenses of $1.7 million due to stock compensation expense in 2023 resulting from stock option grants, bonus paid to the chief executive\nofficer in 2023, the timing of hiring our chief financial officer in June 2022, and the timing of benefits made available in July 2022;\n● increased accounting, legal, marketing, consulting and travel expenses of $0.9 million for costs associated with preparing to become a public company;\n● increased facilities expense of $0.3 million for the cost of our leased office space, and\n● increased board of directors expenses of $0.3 million due to stock compensation expense in 2023 resulting from stock option grants.\nOther Loss\nOther loss was $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and was comprised of the following:\n● a loss of $7.2 million due to an increase in the liability instrument prior to our Direct Listing; and\n● a loss of $0.2 million due to an increase in the derivative liability related to the 2022 Notes prior to conversion.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $0.1 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease of $0.6 million was due to the conversion in\n2023 of convertible notes issued in December 2021, January 2022, and April 2022. Interest expense was recorded in 2022 and 2023, up to the point of the conversion, which\noccurred from February 2023 to June 2023, for the nominal interest rate of 6.0% plus the amortization of the discount on the 2022 convertible notes.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate was 0.0% for all periods. Currently, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nThrough February 20, 2024, we have financed our operations primarily with investment from FibroGenesis, proceeds from borrowings under our convertible loan agreements,\nproceeds from the issuance of preferred stock, and proceeds from the sale of common stock through the GEM Capital Stock Purchase Agreement. From inception through\nDecember 31, 2023, we have received aggregate proceeds of approximately $5.6 million from sales of our convertible notes and $18.6 million from the sales of preferred stock.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $9.2 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $17.1 million. As of December 31,\n2023, we had no outstanding debt.\n85\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (6,401) $ (4,066)\nNet cash used in investing activities (495) —\nNet cash provided by financing activities 13,793 5,925\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 6,897 $ 1,859\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $6.4 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and consisted primarily of net losses of\n$16.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively. Net losses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were partially offset by $7.2 million in other loss due to increase in liability\ninstrument, $1.8 million in noncash stock-based compensation expense, an increase of $0.7 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, $0.1 million increase in payable\nto Parent, $0.1 million net change in operating lease right-of-use asset and liability, and other noncash expenses of $0.1 million in noncash amortization of convertible notes\ndebt discount and $0.1 million in other loss on derivative liability. An increase of $0.5 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, plus noncash expenses of $0.3 million\nin stock-based compensation expense and $0.4 million in amortization of convertible notes debt discount, partially offset the net losses for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $0.5 million and none for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2023, we purchased\napproximately $0.5 million of equipment for cash and $0.3 million of equipment in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $13.8 million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2023, we\nreceived $14.9 million from the sale of Series B Preferred Stock, $1.2 million from the sale of Series B-1 Preferred Stock, and $0.3 million in repayment of a note receivable\nfrom FibroGenesis, and we paid $2.6 million to FibroGenesis pursuant to the ROFN Agreement. In 2022, we received $4.3 million from the issuance of convertible notes in\nJanuary and April 2022, and received $2.2 million from the issuance of preferred stock in December 2022. We repaid $0.2 million and loaned $0.4 million to FibroGenesis in\n2022, and FibroGenesis repaid $0.1 million to us in 2022.\nFunding Requirements\nWe do not have any products approved for sale, and we have never generated any revenue from contracts with customers. We do not expect to generate any meaningful revenue\nunless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our current or future product candidates and we do not know when, or if, that will occur. We expect\nto continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our\ncurrent and future product candidates, and begin to commercialize any approved products. We are subject to all the risks typically related to the development of new product\ncandidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. Moreover,\nfollowing the completion of our direct listing, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nThe financial statements have been prepared as though we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the\nnormal course of business. We have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated\ndeficit of approximately $17.1 million. Management expects to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows.\n86\nWe will need to raise additional capital to continue to fund our operations. We believe we will be able to obtain additional capital through equity financings or other\narrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that such additional financing, if available, can be obtained on acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain\nsuch additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued.\nWe believe that our existing capital will enable us to fund our operations through at least February 28, 2025. We may need to raise additional capital in connection with our cash\nneeds for capital expenditures and working capital beyond December 31, 2024. We have based the foregoing estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we\ncould use our capital resources sooner than we expect.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n● the initiation, progress, timeline, cost and results of our clinical trials for our product candidates;\n● the initiation, progress, timeline, cost and results of additional research and preclinical studies related to pipeline development and other research programs we initiate\nin the future;\n● the cost and timing of manufacturing activities, including our planned manufacturing scale-up activities associated with our product candidates and other programs as\nwe advance them through preclinical and clinical development through commercialization;\n● the potential expansion of our current development programs to seek new indications;\n● the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n● the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, in-licensed or otherwise;\n● the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n● the payment of licensing fees, potential royalty payments and potential milestone payments;\n● the cost of general operating expenses;\n● the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval in regions where we\nchoose to commercialize our products on our own; and\n● the costs of operating as a public company.\nFurther, our operating plan may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials and other research and\ndevelopment expenditures.\nIf we need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing\nwhen needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our preclinical studies, clinical trials, research and development programs or\ncommercialization efforts. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and\nother licensing arrangements. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions,\nsuch as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other\ncollaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future\nrevenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\n87\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nPlease see “Part II., Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Need for Additional Capital.”\nWe have material cash requirements and other contractual obligations related to our office and lab rent (as described in Note 10, “Leases” to the financial statements in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements or holdings in any variable interest entities.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. In accordance with GAAP,\nwe evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nActual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe define our critical accounting estimates as those under GAAP that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to\nhave a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. While our significant accounting\npolicies are more fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report, we believe the following are the critical accounting estimates\nused in the preparation of our financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs consist of costs incurred in performing research and development\nactivities, including salaries and bonuses, scientist recruiting costs, employee benefits, facilities costs, laboratory supplies, manufacturing expenses, preclinical expenses,\nresearch materials, and consulting and other contracted services. Costs for certain research and development activities are recognized based on the terms of the individual\narrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure all stock option grants to employees, directors and non-employees based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize the corresponding compensation\nexpense of those awards using the straight-line method over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Forfeitures are accounted\nfor as they occur.\nWe classify stock-based compensation expense in our statements of operations in the same way the award recipient’s payroll costs are classified or in which the award\nrecipient’s service payments are classified.\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses as inputs the fair value of our common stock and assumptions\nwe make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock\noptions and our expected dividend yield.\n89\nThe estimated fair value of our common stock underlying our stock-based awards has been determined by our board of directors as of each option grant date with input from\nmanagement, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock and our board of directors’ assessment of additional objective and subjective\nfactors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. These third-party valuations were\nperformed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-\nCompany Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (the Practice Aid).\nNow that a public trading market for our common stock has been established in connection with the completion of the Direct Listing, it will no longer be necessary for our\nboard of directors to estimate the fair value of our common stock in connection with our accounting for granted stock options and other such awards we may grant, as the fair\nvalue of our common stock will be determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock.\nSee Note 11 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further information concerning the assumptions we used in in determining stock-\nbased compensation.\nROFN Agreement\nIn January 2023, we entered into an Agreement Regarding Right of First Negotiation with FibroGenesis, or the ROFN Agreement. In exchange for FibroGenesis’ consent to\namend our certificate of incorporation to (i) eliminate upon our underwritten initial public offering or the direct listing of our common stock on a securities exchange (which we\ncollectively refer to as an IPO) or sale of our company, the liquidation preference for the Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) make the Series B Preferred Stock liquidation preference\nequal to Series A Preferred Stock, and (iii) to provide that upon an IPO or sale of our company, the Series A Preferred Stock will be canceled for no consideration, we agreed to\npay to FibroGenesis 15% of the gross proceeds from any equity investments in us prior to an IPO or sale of our company. In addition, we received a five-year right of first\nnegotiation if FibroGenesis decides to license externally any of its technology. Based upon our management’s estimates at execution of the ROFN Agreement of capital to be\nraised in advance of a public listing, we recorded a derivative liability of $2.6 million for the expected future payments to FibroGenesis. As a deemed dividend, the derivative\nliability was recorded first against the net Parent Investment and then to Additional paid-in capital after the net Parent Investment was eliminated. Amounts paid to\nFibroGenesis in excess of the derivative liability are recorded as other losses in the statement of operations. The deemed dividend is included as a reduction to net loss in the\ncalculation of amount available to common stockholders in determining earnings per share.\nLiability Instrument\nOn November 12, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with certain investors for the sale of up to $100,000 thousand of common stock at the option of\nthe Company (the “Aggregate Limit”) at 90% of the average applicable Daily Closing Price during the Draw Down Pricing Period. This agreement is contingent upon the\nCompany achieving a public listing of its common stock. Major terms of the agreement include five-year warrants issued to the investors at the time of public listing to\npurchase common stock shares equal to 4% of the total equity interests of the Company at the lesser of a) the price per share at the time of the public listing or b) the quotient of\n$700,000 thousand divided by the total number of equity interests (fully diluted common shares). The Company may request a drawdown, or sale of common stock shares to\nthe investors, over the five-year term of this agreement following the public listing unless terminated earlier.\nUpon issuance, the warrants will be freestanding derivative financial instruments and must be liability classified until such time as they qualify for equity classification. A\nchange to equity classification may not occur until the Adjustment Date when the strike price adjustment period is concluded. For accounting purposes, the warrants are\nconsidered issued regardless of the contingent event (public listing) for future issuance. The Company valued the contingent warrant at inception at $0 based upon the low\nlikelihood of a future public listing. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the contingent warrant was included with the contingent put option and recognized as Liability\ninstrument, and the increase in fair value since inception was recognized as other loss (Change in fair value of liability instrument) in the Statement of Operations. Any future\nchanges in the fair value of the Liability instrument, up to the point of reclassification to equity classification, will be recognized in other gains and losses in the Statement of\nOperations each reporting period. The Company will reassess the liability classification criteria each reporting period to determine if reclassification to equity classification is\nrequired, and any prior gains and losses recognized in earnings up to the point of reclassification will not be reversed.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the liability instrument includes the contingent warrant and the contingent put option as a single unit of account. As of December 31, 2023, the\nliability instrument value was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model and management’s assumption of a 50% likelihood as of December 31, 2023, of becoming a\npublic company prior to the expiration of the Stock Purchase Agreement. Inputs used in the Black-Scholes valuation model included an estimated number of warrants, an\nassumed common stock share price of $15.00 per share, the five-year time to maturity, a 0% dividend yield, an annual risk-free interest rate of 3.84% for the five-year time to\nmaturity, and an assumed annualized volatility of 96% based on comparable companies with a five-year history of stock prices. As of December 31, 2023, the Company\nevaluated the put option component of the liability instrument and determined that any value as it relates to the liability instrument would be de minimus given the Company’s\nfinancial condition, intention to seek other sources of financing as needed, and ability do so given access to public markets.\nThe JOBS Act\nWe are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards\nissued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies.\nWe have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private\ncompanies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided\nin the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company\neffective dates. If we were to subsequently elect instead to comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to the JOBS Act.\n90\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) December 31, 2028, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at\nleast $1.235 billion, (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would\noccur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates was $700.0 million or more as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year or (iv) the\ndate on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and are not required to provide the\ninformation specified under this item.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe financial statements required by this item are attached to this Form 10-K beginning with page F-1, and is incorporated here by reference.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a–15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of\nachieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision, and with the participation, of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered\nby this Annual Report on Form 10–K. During the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our management identified a material\nweakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to a lack of segregation of duties. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,\nin internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis.\nSpecifically, our management identified a material weakness in our internal controls within the financial reporting function that resulted from an ineffective design and\nimplementation of controls over proper segregation of duties for the period of time covered by our financial statements prior to our Chief Financial Officer joining us in June\n2022 when all financial functions were handled by a single individual, and afterward, through December 31, 2023, due to a limited number of individuals. Based upon such\nevaluation, and due to the material weakness identified, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were not effective.\nRemediation Plan for Material Weakness\nWith the addition of our Chief Financial Officer and the changes made to our accounting and financial reporting processes and internal controls during the last half of fiscal\nyear 2022 and through December 31, 2023, we have strengthened our internal controls and will continue to add staff, evaluate segregation of duties, and implement initiatives\nto improve our internal controls over financial reporting as we grow.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that occurred during the year ended December\n31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of\ninherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within an organization have been detected.\nAccordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. We continue to implement, improve and refine our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting.\n91\nItem 9B. Other Information\nNone\nItem 9C.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\nCertain Relationships and Related Transactions\nThe following is a summary of transactions or series of transactions since inception, or currently proposed transactions or series of transactions, to which we were, or will be, a\nparty, in which the amount involved exceeded, or will exceed, $120,000, and in which any of our directors, executive officers, or to our knowledge, beneficial owners of 5% or\nmore of our capital stock, or 5%+ Security Holders, or any member of the immediate family of, or entities affiliated with, any of the foregoing persons, had, or will have, a\ndirect or indirect material interest.\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nIn May 2021, as part our formation, we issued the equivalent of 8,750,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock to FibroGenesis in exchange for a Patent Assignment\nAgreement, which assigns certain patents/applications to us, and an Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreement, which provides to us an exclusive license within defined\nfields of use for patents/applications retained by FibroGenesis and provides to FibroGenesis an exclusive license to the patents/applications assigned to FibroBiologics for all\nother fields of use.\nIn connection with the Direct Listing, all of our then outstanding Series A Preferred Stock was automatically canceled, without the payment of additional consideration by or to\nthe holder thereof.\nSeries C Preferred Stock\nIn January 2024, in conjunction with our Direct Listing, we issued 2,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock with super voting rights to our CEO for no consideration.\nFibroGenesis Loans\nIn July 2022, we loaned $300,000 to FibroGenesis at 0% interest and one year maturity date. In October 2022, we loaned an additional $60,000 to FibroGenesis at 0% interest\nand one year maturity. The $60,000 was fully repaid in December 2022 and the $300,000 was fully repaid in April 2023.\nROFN Agreement\nIn January 2023, we entered into an Agreement Regarding Right of First Negotiation with FibroGenesis, or the ROFN Agreement. In exchange for FibroGenesis’ consent to\namend our certificate of incorporation to (i) eliminate upon our underwritten initial public offering or the direct listing of our common stock on a securities exchange (which we\ncollectively refer to as an IPO) or sale of our company, the liquidation preference for the Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) make the Series B Preferred Stock liquidation preference\nequal to Series A Preferred Stock and (iii) to provide that upon an IPO or sale of our company, the Series A Preferred Stock will be canceled for no consideration, we agreed to\npay to FibroGenesis 15% of the gross proceeds from any equity investments in us prior to an IPO or sale of our company. In addition, we received a five-year right of first\nnegotiation if FibroGenesis decides to license externally any of its technology. Through December 31, 2023, we have paid a total of $2.6 million to FibroGenesis under the\nROFN Agreement based upon gross proceeds from equity investments received through December 31, 2023.\n2021 and 2022 Convertible Notes\nIn December 2021, we issued and sold to investors, some of whom hold more than 5% shares, in a private placement $1.3 million of our convertible promissory notes, or the\n2021 Notes. The 2021 Notes bore interest at an initial interest rate of 6.0% per annum and would have automatically converted into shares of our common stock in the event of\na qualified financing. The conversion price of the 2021 Notes was equal to $200.0 million divided by the total number of equity interests prior to the dilution from the offering.\nThe 2021 Notes were unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full to all of our commercial finance lenders, insurance companies, lease\nfinancing institutions or other lending institutions approved by our board of directors and regularly engaged in the business of lending money. In April 2023, $1.3 million of\nthese notes were converted into shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and none of the 2021 Notes are outstanding.\nIn January 2022 and April 2022, we issued and sold to investors, some of whom hold more than 5% of shares, in a private placement $0.35 million and $3.95 million,\nrespectively, of our convertible promissory notes, or the 2022 Notes. The 2022 Notes bore interest at an initial interest rate of 6.0% per annum, had a one-year maturity, and\ncould have been converted at the holder’s request into shares of our common stock in the event of a qualified financing. The conversion price of the 2022 Notes was the lesser\nof (i) a 15% discount to the offering price of our common stock in the event of an IPO or (i) the quotient of $200.0 million divided by total equity interests prior to the dilution\nfrom the offering. The 2022 Notes were unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full to all of our commercial finance lenders, insurance\ncompanies, lease financing institutions or other lending institutions approved by our board of directors and regularly engaged in the business of lending money. In February\n2023 through June 2023, $4.3 million of these notes were converted into shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and none of the 2022 Notes are outstanding.\n108\nEquity and Compensation Arrangements\nWe adopted on August 10, 2022, and our stockholders approved on August 18, 2022, our 2022 Stock Plan, or the 2022 Plan. The 2022 Plan provides for the grant of incentive\nstock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, and other stock awards. We issued in 2022 a total of\nthe equivalent of 101,250 options with an exercise price the equivalent of $3.28 per share to employees, directors, and scientific advisory board members under the 2022 Plan.\nIn February 2023, we issued an additional equivalent of 3,689,750 options with an exercise price the equivalent of $2.28 per share to employees and directors. Generally,\nawards granted by the Company vest over three years and have an exercise price equal to the estimated fair value of the common stock as determined by our board of directors\nwith consideration given to contemporaneous valuations of our common stock prepared by an independent third-party valuation firm.\nDirector Independence\nOur common stock is listed on Nasdaq. As a company listed on Nasdaq, we are required under Nasdaq listing rules to maintain a board comprised of a majority of independent\ndirectors as determined affirmatively by our board. Under Nasdaq listing rules, a director will only qualify as an independent director if, in the opinion of that listed company’s\nboard of directors, the director does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In\naddition, the Nasdaq listing rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of our audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees\nbe independent.\nAudit committee members must also satisfy the additional independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the\nExchange Act, and Nasdaq listing rules applicable to audit committee members. Compensation committee members must also satisfy the additional independence criteria set\nforth in Nasdaq listing rules applicable to compensation committee members.\nOur board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each of our directors. Based on information provided by each director concerning his or her background,\nemployment and affiliations, our board of directors has determined that all members of our board of directors, except Pete O’Heeron, do not have a relationship that would\ninterfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is an “independent director” as defined\nunder the listing standards of Nasdaq. Pete O’Heeron is not considered an independent director because of his position as our Chief Executive Officer.\nIn making these determinations, our board of directors considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all other facts\nand circumstances that our board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee\ndirector, and the transactions involving them described in the section titled “Related Person Transactions.”\nThere are no family relationships among any of our directors, director nominees or executive officers.\nItem 14.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements of operations,\nchanges in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n“financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect\nto the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ WithumSmith+Brown, PC.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022.\nEast Brunswick, New Jersey\nFebruary 29,

the Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2023\n1. Organization, Description of Business, and Liquidity\nOrganization and Business\nFibroBiologics, Inc. (the “Company” or “FibroBiologics”) was originally formed as a limited liability company (“LLC”) under the laws of the State of Texas on April 8,\n2021 (“Inception”) and then converted to a Delaware corporation on December 14, 2021. FibroBiologics is an early stage, cell therapy company headquartered in Houston,\nTexas, developing innovative treatments for chronic diseases using fibroblast cells. The Company’s primary focus is the initiation and progression of preclinical studies and\nclinical-stage U.S. Food and Drug Administration trials related to fibroblast treatments for Degenerative Disc Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Cancer, Wound Healing and other\ndiseases. Prior to Inception, preclinical research and development related to these disease pathways took place under the parent company, SpinalCyte, LLC (the “Parent” or\n“FibroGenesis”).\nDirect Listing\nOn January 31, 2024, the Company completed a direct listing of its common stock on Nasdaq (the “Direct Listing”). Upon completion of the Direct Listing, all outstanding\nshares of the Company’s Non-voting Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series B-1 Preferred Stock automatically converted into shares of Voting Common Stock\non a one-for-one basis.\nGoing Concern and Management’s Plan\nThe Company has incurred operating losses since Inception and expects such losses to continue in the future as it builds infrastructure, develops intellectual property and\nconducts research and development activities. The Company has primarily relied on a combination of angel investors and private debt placements to funds its operations. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $24,357 thousand and cash and cash equivalents of $9,163 thousand. A transition to profitability will depend\non the successful development, approval and commercialization of product candidates and on the achievement of sufficient revenues to support the Company’s cost structure.\nThe Company currently does not generate revenues and may never achieve profitability. Unless and until such time that revenue and net income are generated, the Company\nwill need to continue to raise additional capital. As further described in Note 8, management has entered into a share purchase agreement as of November 12, 2021. With the\ncompletion of the Company’s Direct Listing, this agreement provides the Company with access to additional liquidity. In February 2024, the Company utilized this facility to\nraise a total of $1,924 thousand. As a result, the Company believes it has adequate capital to fund its current operating plan for at least the next 12 months from the date of\nissuance of these Financial Statements.\nSegments\nOperating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating\ndecision maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. The chief executive officer, who is the chief operating decision maker, reviews\nfinancial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Company operates and manages its business as a\nsingle operating segment and therefore has one reportable segment.\nF-6\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding annual financial reporting.\nDuring the period from January 1, 2021, to its formation on April 8, 2021, the Company operated as a line of business of FibroGenesis rather than as a separate stand-alone\nentity. Consequently, prior to the Company’s formation on April 8, 2021, the financial statements were derived from the historical accounting records of the Parent. All general\nand administrative expenses and research and development expenses directly associated with the business activity of the Company that were originally incurred by the Parent\nfrom January 1, 2021, through the Company’s formation on April 8, 2021, were allocated and included in the Company’s financial statements. The resulting net Parent\ninvestment was presented within stockholders’ equity/(deficit) and represented the Parent’s interest in the recorded net assets of the Company and has been eliminated through\nthe ROFN Agreement as further described in Notes 7 and 11.\nIn October 2023, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware to immediately effect a 1-for-4 shares reverse stock split.\nAll share and per share amounts have been adjusted on a retroactive basis to reflect the effect of the reverse stock split.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. These\nestimates are based on information available as of the date of the Financial Statements; therefore, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company has significant\ncash balances at financial institutions, which, throughout the year, regularly exceed the federally insured limit of $250,000. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds\ncould have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe Company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, changes in any of the following areas that the Company believes could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the future financial position or results of operations: the timing of, and the Company’s ability to advance its current and future product candidates into\nand through clinical development; costs and timelines associated with the manufacture of clinical supplies of the Company’s product candidates; regulatory approval and\nmarket acceptance of its product candidates; performance of third-party contract research organizations (“CROs”) and contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”);\ncompetition from pharmaceutical companies with greater financial resources or expertise; protection of the intellectual property, litigation or claims against the Company based\non intellectual property, or other factors; the need to obtain additional funding; and its ability to attract and retain employees necessary to support its growth. Disruption from\nCROs’, CMOs’ or suppliers’ operations would likely have a negative impact on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of unrestricted cash balances and short-term, liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less at the time of\npurchase. There were no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nF-7\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally three to five years, and includes laboratory equipment that is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of five years. Depreciation expense is classified in either research and development expense or in general and administrative expense,\ndepending upon the nature of the asset, in the accompanying Statements of Operations. When property and equipment assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and\nrelated accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheets and the resulting gain or loss is recorded in other income (loss) in the period realized. Maintenance and\nrepairs are expensed as incurred.\nProperty and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.\nConditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or\nmanner in which an asset is used, or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable. For long-lived\nassets to be held and used, the Company will recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and measure any\nimpairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. There were no such losses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. An arrangement is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a\nperiod of time in exchange for consideration. If a lease is identified, classification is determined at lease commencement. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the present\nvalue of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate and therefore the Company estimates its\nincremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the interest rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a\ncollateralized basis an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment over a similar term. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets are based on the\ncorresponding lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before commencement, initial direct costs, and lease incentives. Renewals or early terminations are not\naccounted for unless the Company is reasonably certain to exercise these options. Operating lease expense is recognized and the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis\nover the lease term.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use asset, operating lease liability, short-term, and operating lease liability, long-term on the Company’s Balance\nSheets.\nThe Company has elected in accordance with ASC 842-20-25-2 an accounting policy to not record short-term leases, defined as those with terms of 12 months or less, on\nthe Balance Sheets. Rent expense recorded under leases, for financial statement purposes, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term based on the most recent\ncontractual terms available.\nFair Value Measurements\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a fair value hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguishes\nbetween assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). Observable inputs are inputs that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the\nCompany’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the\ncircumstances. ASC 820 identifies fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a three-tiered value hierarchy\nthat distinguishes between the following:\nLevel 1 - Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted market prices, interest rates and yield curves.\nF-8\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). Level 3 inputs include management’s own assumptions about the\nassumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk).\nCategorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nDerivatives\nDerivative financial instruments, including the Liability instrument, are recorded at fair value on the Balance Sheet. Liability classified derivatives are remeasured at their\nfair value at each reporting date, with decreases or increases in the fair value recognized as other gain or loss, respectively, within the Statement of Operations. Equity classified\nderivatives are not remeasured at each reporting date. If a liability classified derivative becomes eligible for reclassification to an equity classified derivative, any gains or\nlosses recognized up to the point of reclassification are not reversed.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs consist of costs incurred in performing research and development\nactivities, including salaries and bonuses, scientist recruiting costs, employee benefits, facilities costs, laboratory supplies, manufacturing expenses, preclinical expenses,\nresearch materials, and consulting and other contracted services. Costs for certain research and development activities are recognized based on the terms of the individual\narrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the Financial Statements as prepaid or accrued research and development.\nPatent Costs\nAs the Company continues to incur costs to obtain market approval of patented technology, patent costs are expensed as incurred in general, administrative and other\nexpense in the Statements of Operations. Costs include fees to renew or extend the term of recognized intangible assets, patent defense costs, and patent application costs.\nManagement will continue to expense such costs until market approval is obtained through regulatory approval by the appropriate governing body.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is a C corporation, and accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined\nbased on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected\nto reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nUnder the provisions of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, the Company evaluates uncertain tax positions by reviewing against applicable tax law all positions taken by the\nCompany with respect to tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open. ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized\nwhen it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical\nmerits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of the income tax expense line in the\naccompanying Statements of Operations.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees and nonemployees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date\nof grant and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award. Forfeitures are recognized as they\noccur. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires management to apply judgment and make\nestimates, including:\n● Fair Value of Common Stock—The estimated fair value of our common stock underlying our stock-based awards has been determined by our board of directors as\nof each option grant date with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock and our board of directors’\nassessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation\nthrough the date of the grant. These third-party valuations were performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants’ Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation (the Practice Aid). Now that a\npublic trading market for our common stock has been established in connection with the completion of the Direct Listing, the fair value of common stock in future\ngrants will be based on the closing price as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.\n● Expected Term—The expected term represents the period that a stock-based award is expected to be outstanding. The Company uses the simplified method to\ndetermine the expected term, which is based on the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the option.\n● Expected Volatility— Due to the Company’s limited operating history and lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, the expected volatility is\nestimated based on the average historical volatilities of common stock of comparable publicly traded entities over a period of time commensurate with the\nexpected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies are chosen based on their size, stage in the product development cycle, or area of specialty.\nThe Company will continue to apply this process until sufficient historical information regarding the volatility of its own stock price becomes available.\nF-9\n● Risk-Free Interest Rate—The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with\nmaturities approximately equal to the expected term of the awards.\n● Expected Dividend—The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and has no plans to pay dividends on its common stock. Therefore, the\nCompany used an expected dividend yield of zero.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWith the completion of the Direct Listing, the Company is an emerging growth company (EGC), as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS\nAct). Under the JOBS Act, an EGC can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those\nstandards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have\ndifferent effective dates for public and private companies; however, the Company may adopt new or revised accounting standards early if the standard allows for early\nadoption.\nIn addition, the Company will utilize other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided to EGCs by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in\nthe JOBS Act, an EGC is not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on the company’s system of internal controls over financial reporting\npursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-EGC public companies under the\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\nregarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion\nand analysis), or (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items, such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the\nchief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThere have been no accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted by the Company that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Financial\nStatements.\n3. Net Loss per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe following table summarizes the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of the Company:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 2023 2022\nNumerator:\nNet loss $ (16,485) $ (5,121)\nAdjustment to numerator for earnings per share:\nDeemed dividend (2,573) —\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders: $ (19,058) $ (5,121)\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average number of common shares outstanding, basic and diluted 28,230,842 28,230,842\nNet loss per common share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted $ (0.68) $ (0.18)\nF-10\nAs further described in Note 7, the Company issued 28,230,842 shares of non-voting common stock on August 18, 2022. The weighted average number of shares\noutstanding for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, is based upon the non-voting common stock shares issued on August 18, 2022. Because the issuance of\nnonvoting common stock shares was treated as a stock split for accounting purposes, these shares are treated as having been issued on January 1, 2022, and outstanding for the\nentire years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAs further described in Note 11, the Company agreed to pay to FibroGenesis 15% of the gross proceeds from any equity investments in FibroBiologics prior to an Initial\nPublic Offering (“IPO”), Direct Listing or Sale of the Company to eliminate upon the occurrence of such event the Series A Preferred Stock and its $35 million liquidation\npreference. This redemption of preferred stock created a derivative liability that exceeded the net Parent Investment of $1,461 thousand by $1,112 thousand, and is reflected\nhere as a reduction of the amount available to common stockholders in the calculation of earnings per share.\nThe Company had $5,600 thousand of convertible notes outstanding as of December 31, 2022, which could have been converted into common stock in the event that the\nCompany sold and issued shares of capital stock in excess of $10,000 thousand, and were all converted by December 31, 2023, into shares of Series B Preferred Stock as\nfurther described in Note 6. As of December 31, 2022, the estimated number of shares of common stock that would have been issued upon conversion was 801,145 shares. For\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company reported net losses and, accordingly, potential common shares were not included since such inclusion would have\nbeen anti-dilutive. As a result, the Company’s basic and diluted net losses per share are the same because it generated a net loss in all periods presented.\n4. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, net consist of the following:\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nLaboratory equipment $ 816 $ —\nComputer equipment, software, and other 28 —\nTotal property and equipment at cost 844 —\nLess: Accumulated depreciation (47) —\nProperty and equipment, net $ 797 $ —\nThe useful life of Laboratory equipment is five years, and the useful life of Computer equipment, software, and other is three years, for deprecation. Depreciation expense\nwas $47 thousand and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company measured its derivative liability related to the conversion option feature in the 2022 Notes, as described in Note 6, at fair value. As\nof December 31, 2023, the 2022 Notes had been converted, which eliminated the derivative liability.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company measured its liability instrument to investors under the Share Purchase Agreement, as further described in Note 8, at $7,236\nthousand. This liability instrument is classified within Level 3 of the value hierarchy because the liability was based upon a valuation model that used inputs and assumptions\nincluding potential outcomes, interest rates, probabilities, and timing. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, this liability instrument was assigned no value by the Company.\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on the three-tier fair value hierarchy:\nFair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2023\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities:\nDerivative liability — — — —\nLiability instrument — — 7,236 7,236\nTotal fair value — — 7,236 7,236\nF-11\nFair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2022\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities:\nDerivative liability — — 538 538\nLiability instrument — — — —\nTotal fair value — — 538 538\nThe following table summarizes the transfers in and out of Level 3 financial liabilities:\n(in thousands) Derivative Liability Liability Instrument\nFair value at December 31, 2021 $ — $ —\nAddition to derivative liability for debt issuance discount 538 —\nFair value at December 31, 20222 538 —\nReclassification of derivative liability for conversion of Notes to Series B Preferred Stock (538) —\nIncrease in the fair value of the liability instrument — 7,236\nFair value at December 31, 2023 $ — $ 7,236\nAs of December 31, 2023, the liability instrument includes the contingent warrant and the contingent put option as a single unit of account. The liability instrument value\nwas determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model and management’s assumption of a 50% likelihood as of December 31, 2023, of becoming a public company prior to\nthe expiration of the Stock Purchase Agreement. Inputs used in the Black-Scholes valuation model included an estimated number of warrants, an assumed common stock share\nprice of $15.00 per share, the five-year time to maturity, a 0% dividend yield, an annual risk-free interest rate of 3.84% for the five-year time to maturity, and an assumed\nannualized volatility of 96% based on comparable companies with a five-year history of stock prices. As of December 31, 2023, the Company evaluated the put option\ncomponent of the liability instrument and determined that any value as it relates to the liability instrument would be de minimus given the Company’s financial condition,\nintention to seek other sources of financing as needed, and ability to do so given access to public markets.\nThe derivative liability was determined based upon a valuation model that used inputs and assumptions including potential outcomes, interest rates, probabilities, and\ntiming.\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, convertible notes payable, and Parent\ncompany payable and receivable approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities.\nOther than those transfers noted in the table above, there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022.\n6. Convertible Notes Payable\nThe Company entered into multiple convertible promissory note agreements in December 2021 (collectively, the “2021 Notes”).\nF-12\nAt the inception of the 2021 Notes, and at December 31, 2021 and 2022, the Company determined that an embedded derivative for the conversion feature did not meet the\ncriteria because it met the “indexed to the entity’s own stock” exception per the guidance in ASC 815-10-15-74(a) and therefore was not required to be bifurcated from the host\ninstrument.\nThe Company issued additional convertible promissory notes between January and April 2022 with a total principal amount of $4,300 thousand and a one-year maturity\n(collectively, the “2022 Notes”). The 2022 Notes may be converted at the lesser of a) a 15% discount to the offering price of the Company’s common stock in the event of an\ninitial public offering of the Company or b) the quotient of $200,000 thousand divided by total equity interests prior to the dilution from the offering. The conversion option\nfeature in the 2022 Notes was evaluated in accordance with ASC 815, and a derivative liability for the $538 thousand estimated fair value of the conversion option was\nrecorded at the time the notes were issued and as of December 31, 2022. An offsetting discount on the issuance of the notes was recorded and is being amortized to interest\nexpense over the expected life of the 2022 Notes.\nThe interest expense, excluding amortization of the discount recorded on the 2022 Notes, on the 2021 and 2022 Notes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nwas $65 thousand and $265 thousand, respectively. Accrued interest was outstanding and included within accounts payable and accrued expenses at December 31, 2022.\nIn February 2023, the Company converted the principal and interest on $3,700 thousand of principal value of the 2022 Notes into 799,603 shares of Series “B” Preferred\nStock. In April 2023, the Company also converted the principal and interest on $1,300 thousand of principal value of the 2021 Notes and $300 thousand of principal value on\nthe 2022 Notes into 353,713 shares of Series “B” Preferred Stock. In September 2023, the Company converted the principal and interest on $300 thousand of principal value of\nthe 2022 Notes into 66,077 shares of Series “B” Preferred Stock. No interest was outstanding and included within accounts payable and accrued expenses at December 31,\n2023.\nThe convertible debt balances consisted of the following at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nConvertible notes principal $ — $ 5,600\nConvertible notes discount — (149)\nConvertible notes payable, net of discount $ — $ 5,451\n7.

As of December 31,\n2022, the Company had issued 8,750,000 Series “A” Preferred Stock shares to FibroGenesis, which were tendered pursuant to the formation of the Company in exchange for\nthe contribution of certain in-process research and development and patent assets through Patent Assignment and Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreements. The Series\n“A” Preferred Stock shares had the right to vote and ranked prior to non-voting common stock and common stock with respect to payment of dividends and distributions and\nupon liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or otherwise. In addition, the Series “A” Preferred Stock had a liquidation preference equal to $35,000 thousand to be allocated\namong the holders of the Series “A” Preferred Stock shares in the event of a liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Company, which was subsequently eliminated as part\nof the ROFN Agreement as further described below, and each share of Series “A” Preferred Stock could have been converted into one share of common stock at any time at the\nelection of the holder of such shares of Series “A” Preferred Stock. Unless otherwise elected by the holder(s), a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the\nmajority surviving entity or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation would have been a deemed liquidation event. The Company had also authorized\n62,500,000 shares of non-voting common stock, and issued during the year ended December 31, 2022, a total of 28,230,842 shares. In August 2022, the Company issued\n28,179,592 shares of non-voting common stock to its Parent, which in turn distributed the shares to its members. This issuance of non-voting common stock was accounted for\nas stock split and no proceeds were received by the Company. The Company also issued to its board of directors, a consultant, and an employee an additional 51,250 total\nshares in 2022 and recorded $168 thousand of expense for the issuance of these shares, which was based upon a third-party valuation of the shares at the time of issuance.\nF-13\nIn December 2022, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to authorize 2,500,000 shares of Series “B” Preferred Stock and issued 381,658 shares in\nexchange for $2,150 thousand. The Series “B” Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference after Series “A” Preferred Stock and prior to Common Stock and Non-Voting\nCommon Stock. The Series “B” Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $6.76 per share, subject to adjustment, has voting rights, and will automatically convert into\nCommon Stock upon closing of an IPO transaction, as defined in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\nIn January 2023, to reflect the ROFN Agreement with its Parent, as further discussed in Note 11, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to a) eliminate\nupon IPO, Direct Listing, or Sale of the Company the Series “A” Preferred Stock $35,000 thousand liquidation preference, b) make the Series “B” Preferred Stock liquidation\npreference equal to Series “A” Preferred Stock, and c) to provide that upon IPO, Direct Listing, or Sale of the Company Series “A” Preferred Stock will be canceled for no\nconsideration.\nIn April 2023, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to authorize 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock, increase the number of authorized Series “B”\nPreferred Stock shares up to 5,000,000 shares, and to authorize 5,000,000 shares of Series “B-1” Preferred Stock with liquidation preference equal to the Series “A” and “B”\nPreferred Stock. The Series “B-1” Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $20.00 per share, subject to adjustment, has voting rights, and will automatically convert into\nCommon Stock upon closing of an IPO transaction, as defined in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company raised $4,620 thousand, net of fees, through a Regulation CF offering with 890,310 shares of Series “B” Preferred\nStock issued, raised $10,325 thousand in a private placement with 1,680,084 shares of Series “B” Preferred Stock issued, and raised $1,193 thousand in a private placement\nwith 89,781 shares of “B-1” Preferred Stock and 10,321 warrants issued.\nIn October 2023, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware to increase to 100,000,000 shares its authorized shares of\nvoting common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, reduce to 30,000,000 shares its authorized shares of non-voting common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, and\nauthorize 2,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, par value $0.00001 per share. The Series C Preferred Stock ranks senior to common stock and non-voting common stock\nand junior to the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock upon liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or otherwise. The Series C\nPreferred Stock shall have no voting rights prior to an IPO, and 13,000 votes per share upon closing of an IPO. The Series C Preferred Stock is not entitled to dividends, has a\nliquidation preference of $18.00 per share, subject to adjustment, may be converted 1:1 at any time at the option of the holder into common stock, and upon closing of an IPO\nwill if transferred automatically convert 1:1 into common stock.\nAlso in October 2023, the Company filed an amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the State of Delaware to immediately effect a 1-for-4 reverse stock\nsplit. All share and per share amounts in these Financial Statements have been adjusted on a retroactive basis to reflect the effect of the reverse stock split.\n8. Share Subscription Agreement\nOn November 12, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with certain investors for the sale of up to $100,000 thousand of common stock (the\n“Aggregate Limit”). This agreement is contingent upon the Company achieving a public listing of its common stock. Major terms of the agreement include a commitment fee\nof 2% of the Aggregate Limit, which is due no later than one year after public listing even if no drawdowns are taken, and five-year warrants issued to the investors at the time\nof public listing to purchase common stock shares equal to 4% of the total equity interests of the Company at the lesser of a) the price per share at the time of the public listing\nor b) the quotient of $700,000 thousand divided by the total number of equity interests (fully diluted common shares). The Company may request a drawdown, or sale of\ncommon stock shares to the investors, over the five-year term of this agreement following the public listing unless terminated earlier. The amount of the drawdowns requested\nis limited by the trading volumes of the Company’s common stock shares over the 30-day period preceding the drawdown, and the price per share is equal to 90% of the\naverage price per share over that same period. A 1% fee must be paid to the investors if the Company is sold in a private sale transaction rather than completing a public listing\nof its shares.\nF-14\n9. Income Taxes\nA reconciliation of the income tax benefit computed using the federal statutory income tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate is as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nFederal statutory rate (21.0)% (21.0)%\nPermanent items 9.2 0.8\nTrue-up prior-year net operating loss deferred tax asset — (6.1)\nNon-deductible stock compensation 1.6 0.0\nOther changes — 1.9\nChange in valuation allowance 10.2 24.4%\nTotal 0.0% 0.0%\nThe components of the Company’s net deferred tax assets are as follows:\n(in thousands of dollars) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryforwards $ 2,005 $ 896\nCapitalized research and development 675 299\nLease liability 367 435\nAccrued liabilities 156 81\nStock compensation 123 17\nDerivative liability — 31\nDeferred tax assets 3,326 1,759\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nLease right-of-use asset (380) (462)\nFixed assets (11) —\nUnamortized debt discount — (31)\nDeferred tax liabilities (391) (493)\nLess: Valuation allowance (2,935) (1,266)\nNet deferred tax assets $ — $ —\nThe Company was initially formed as an LLC and was converted to a Delaware corporation in December 2021. As a result of generating net operating losses during the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no income tax expense for years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had\nU.S. federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $9,547 thousand. The federal NOL carries forward indefinitely and may become subject to an annual limitation in the\nevent of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax\nliabilities. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years.\nF-15\nEffective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, taxpayers are required to capitalize any expenses incurred that are considered incidental to research and\nexperimentation (“R&E”) activities under IRC Section 174. While taxpayers historically had the option of deducting these expenses under Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”)\nSection 174, the December 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act mandates capitalization and amortization of R&E expenses for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. Expenses\nincurred in connection with R&E activities in the United States must be amortized over a 5-year period if incurred, and R&E expenses incurred outside the United States must\nbe amortized over a 15-year period. R&E activities are broader in scope than qualified research activities considered under IRC Section 41 (relating to the research tax credit).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company performed an analysis based on available guidance and determined that it will continue to be in a loss position even after\nthe required capitalization and amortization of its R&E expenses. The Company will continue to monitor this issue for future developments, but it does not expect R&E\ncapitalization and amortization to require it to pay cash taxes now or in the near future. The Company has included the impact of this provision, which results in a deferred tax\nasset of approximately $680 thousand as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of the Company’s net deferred tax assets and has determined that it is more\nlikely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance at December 31,\n2023 and 2022. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets going forward and will adjust the valuation allowance as needed.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes both interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax\nbenefits as a component of income tax expense. The Company has not recorded any interest or penalties for unrecognized tax benefits since its inception, and no taxes are due.\n10. Leases, Commitments and Contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had entered into two short-term lease agreements for lab and office space. The Company opted on March 30, 2022, to extend the\nlease term for one of its leases for lab and office space, with a commencement date for the lease extension on May 1, 2022. The extended lease term was 126 months and was\naccounted for as an operating lease under the ASC 842 guidance for lease accounting. A right-of-use lease asset and tenant improvement allowance receivable with a combined\ntotal of $2,799 thousand and a lease liability of $2,799 thousand were recorded at the time of the extension. This lease was terminated as of July 31, 2022, and the remaining\nbalances of the right-of-use asset, tenant improvement allowance receivable, and lease liability were written off.\nThe Company expanded the scope and extended for six months the term for the remaining lease for temporary lab and office space on July 1, 2022, then further expanded\nthe scope on August 1, 2022, and October 7, 2022, which increased the monthly license fee to $15 thousand per month. In January 2023, the Company extended this lease for\nan additional six months and it expired at the end of June 2023. This lease for temporary lab and office space was accounted for as a short-term lease.\nIn October 2022, the Company entered into a lease agreement for office space with a term of 62 months, which expires on November 30, 2027. This lease will be\naccounted for as an operating lease under the ASC 842 guidance for lease accounting. A right-of-use lease asset and lease liability of $2,293 thousand each were recorded at\ninception of the lease term using a discount rate of 7.5%.\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into a new lease for temporary lab and office space for its research operations. This lease has a term of 12 months and monthly rent of\n$6 thousand and will be accounted for as a short-term lease. This lease commenced in August 2023. In September 2023, the Company entered into an amendment of this lease\nto additional space, and the monthly rent increased to $7 thousand.\nRent expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $685 thousand and $392 thousand, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, noncancelable lease\npayments under operating leases were $2,017 thousand and noncancelable lease payments under short-term leases were $45 thousand.\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023, were as follows:\n(in thousands of dollars)\n2024 $ 477\n2025 487\n2026 544\n2027 509\nThereafter —\nTotal lease payments 2,017\nLess: Imputed interest (270)\nTotal lease liability 1,747\nLess: Current lease liability (362)\nTotal non-current lease liability $ 1,385\nF-16\n11. Related Party Transactions\nThe Company repaid in April 2022 the remaining Parent company payable of $225 thousand, which was outstanding at December 31, 2021. In July 2022, the Company\nloaned $300 thousand to the Parent on a one-year note bearing no interest. In October 2022, the Company loaned $60 thousand to the Parent on a one-year note bearing no\ninterest and this note was repaid before December 31, 2022. In April 2023, FibroGenesis repaid in full the $300 thousand Parent company receivable.\nAs described in Note 7, the Company acquired from FibroGenesis certain in-process research and development and patent assets through Patent Assignment and\nIntellectual Property Cross-License Agreements. The Patent Assignment Agreement transferred the right, title and interest in and to certain patents from FibroGenesis to the\nCompany for further development. The Intellectual Property Cross-License Agreement grants to the Company exclusive rights to patents owned by FibroGenesis in a limited\nfield of use, which includes the diagnosis, treatment, prevention and palliation of a) spinal diseases, disorders, or conditions, b) cancer, c) orthopedics diseases, disorders or\nconditions, and d) multiple sclerosis.\nIn January 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement Regarding Right of First Negotiation (“ROFN Agreement”) with its Parent, FibroGenesis. In exchange for\nFibroGenesis’ consent to amend the Certificate of Incorporation to a) eliminate upon IPO, Direct Listing, or Sale of the Company the Series A Preferred Stock $35,000\nthousand liquidation preference, b) make the Series B Preferred Stock liquidation preference equal to Series “A” Preferred Stock, and c) to provide that upon IPO, Direct\nListing, or Sale of the Company Series A Preferred Stock will be canceled for no consideration, FibroBiologics agreed to pay to FibroGenesis 15% of the gross proceeds from\nany equity investments in FibroBiologics prior to an IPO, Direct Listing or Sale of the Company. In addition, FibroBiologics will receive a five-year right of first negotiation if\nFibroGenesis decides to license externally any of its technology. In January 2023, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to reflect these changes, recorded a\nderivative liability of $2,573 thousand for the expected future payments to FibroGenesis, and paid $323 thousand to FibroGenesis for 15% of the gross proceeds from equity\nissued by the Company in December 2022. Based on its relationship to Series A Preferred Stock as described above, the derivative liability was recorded first against the net\nParent Investment and then to Additional paid-in capital after the net Parent Investment was eliminated. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company raised gross\nproceeds of $16,418 thousand from equity issuances and paid $2,322 thousand of these proceeds to FibroGenesis. Amounts paid in excess of the derivative liability are\nrecorded as other loss in the Statements of Operations. There was no derivative liability and a payable of $141 thousand to FibroGenesis as of December 31, 2023.\n12. Share-Based Compensation\nThe Company adopted on August 10, 2022, and the stockholders approved on August 18, 2022, the 2022 Stock Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan provides for the grant of\nincentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, and other stock awards. The Plan, through the\ngrant of stock awards, is intended to help the Company secure and retain the services of eligible award recipients, provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts\nfor the success of the Company and provide a means by which the eligible recipients may benefit from increases in value of the common stock. In September 2022, the\nCompany issued a total of 101,250 options with a strike price of $3.28 per share to employees, directors, and scientific advisory board members under this Plan. In February\n2023, the Company issued an additional total of 3,689,750 options with a strike price of $2.28 per share to employees and directors under this Plan. In August 2023, a total of\n2,500 options with a strike price of $3.28 per share were forfeited. Generally, awards granted by the Company vest over four years and have an exercise price equal to the\nestimated fair value of the common stock as determined by the board of directors with consideration given to contemporaneous valuations of the Company’s common stock\nprepared by an independent third-party valuation firm.\nF-17\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, there were 8,711,500 shares and 12,398,750 shares available for future issuance under the Plan.\nStock-based compensation expense is recognized in the Statements of Operations as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands of dollars) 2023 2022\nResearch and development $ 262 $ 115\nGeneral and administrative 1,503 150\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 1,765 $ 265\nStock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, includes $168 thousand of expense for non-voting common stock issued to the Board of\nDirectors and consultants.\nUnrecognized stock-based compensation costs related to unvested awards and the weighted-average period over which the costs are expected to be recognized as of\nDecember 31, 2023, are as follows:\nStock Options\nUnrecognized stock-based compensation expense (in thousands) $ 5,039\nExpected weighted-average period compensation costs to be recognized (years) 3.0\nA summary of the Company’s stock option activity is as follows:\nWeighted-Average\nWeighted-Average Remaining Aggregate Intrinsic\nExercise Price per Contractual Life Value (in\nStock Options Share (years) thousands)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2022 101,250 $ 3.28 9.4 —\nGranted 3,689,750 $ 2.28 10.0 —\nExercised — $ — — —\nForfeited/canceled 2,500 $ 3.28 8.7 —\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 3,788,500 $ 2.31 9.1 —\nExercisable as of December 31, 2023 68,519 $ 3.28 8.7 —\nThe fair value of stock options granted to employees, directors, and consultants was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using\nthe following assumptions:\nYear Ended Year Ended\nAssumptions: December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nRisk-free interest rate 3.9% 4.1%\nExpected volatility 90% 100%\nExpected term (years) 7.0 5.4 to 6.4\nExpected dividend 0% 0%\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of the options granted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.80 per share and $2.64 per share,\nrespectively.\n13. Subsequent Events\nThe Company’s registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was declared effective on January 24, 2024, and trading of the\nCompany’s stock commenced on Nasdaq on January 31, 2024 (Direct Listing). In January 2024, in conjunction with its Direct Listing, the Company issued 2,500 shares of\nSeries C Preferred Stock with super voting rights to our CEO. Upon the effectiveness of its registration with the SEC, the Company obtained a public company directors and\nofficers insurance policy at a cost of $756 thousand, which will be expensed over the one-year life of the policy. Upon approval from Nasdaq and prior to the Direct Listing, the\n$270 thousand remainder of the listing application fee was due and paid to Nasdaq. Also upon completion of the Direct Listing, the Company paid $200 thousand to Maxim for\nits services as advisor on the Direct Listing, and recorded a $2,000 thousand payable for the commitment fee and issued 1,299,783 warrants to purchase common stock shares at\nan exercise price of $21.54 and an expiration of five years from the Direct Listing, which were both due to the investors in the Share Purchase Agreement as described in Note\n8.\nIn February 2024, the Company sold a total of 142,298 shares for $1,921 thousand through the Share Purchase Agreement described in Note 8.\nF-18\nExhibit 4.2\nDESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES\nREGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE\nSECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nAs of February 12, 2024 FibroBiologics, Inc.

Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors will have the authority, without stockholder approval except\nas required by Nasdaq rules, to issue additional shares of our capital stock.\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, authorize us to issue 110,000,000 shares of capital stock, which may consist of: (i) 100,000,000 shares of\ncommon stock, par value $0.00001 per share and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share, of which 2,500 shares are designated as Series C\nPreferred Stock.\nCommon Stock\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that:\n● holders of common stock have voting rights for the election of our directors and all other matters requiring stockholder action, except with respect to amendments to\nour certificate of incorporation that alter or change the powers, preferences, rights or other terms of any outstanding preferred stock if the holders of such affected\nseries of preferred stock are entitled to vote on such an amendment;\n● holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters to be voted on by stockholders and are also entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be\ndeclared from time to time by our board of directors in its discretion out of funds legally available therefor;\n● the payment of dividends, if any, on the common stock will be subject to the prior payment of dividends on any outstanding preferred stock;\n● upon our liquidation or dissolution, the holders of common stock will be entitled to receive pro rata all assets remaining available for distribution to stockholders after\npayment of all liabilities and provision for the liquidation of any shares of preferred stock outstanding at that time; and\n● our stockholders have no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no sinking fund or redemption provisions applicable to the common stock.\nPreferred Stock\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors is\nauthorized to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations\nand restrictions thereof, applicable to the shares of each series. Our board of directors is able to, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights\nthat could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the common stock and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to\nissue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of our control or the removal of our existing\nmanagement.\nSeries C Preferred Stock\nThere is currently one series of designated preferred stock, being the Series C Preferred Stock, 2,500 total shares of which are authorized and all of which 2,500 authorized\nshares of Series C Preferred Stock are issued, outstanding and held by Pete O’Heeron, our founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson of our board of directors.

Each share of Series C Preferred Stock shall\nautomatically convert, without the payment of additional consideration by or to the holder thereof, into one fully paid and non-assessable share of our common stock, upon any\ntransfer of any share of Series C Preferred Stock, whether or not for value. Any shares of Series C Preferred Stock converted as described above must be retired and cancelled\nand may not be reissued as shares of such series.\nFor as long as the Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the aggregate number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding, shall be proportionately adjusted\nfor any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of our common stock resulting from a subdivision or combination of our common stock or other similar\nrecapitalization, in each case effected without our receipt of consideration.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock is subject to an irrevocable proxy issued by Pete O’Heeron, the holder of all of the Series C Preferred Stock, in favor and for the benefit of, our\nboard of directors, granting our board of directors the irrevocable proxy, for as long as the Series C Preferred Stock remains outstanding, to vote all of the Series C Preferred\nStock on all matters on which the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, in any manner that our board of directors may determine in its sole and absolute discretion;\nprovided, however, that such irrevocable proxy shall not, without the written consent of Pete O’Heeron, permit our board of directors to vote the Series Preferred Stock with\nrespect to any proposal to amend, delete or waive any rights of Pete O’Heeron with respect to the Series C Preferred Stock as set forth in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation. In light of the superior voting rights associated with the Series C Preferred Stock, the irrevocable proxy is intended to ensure that such superior voting rights are\nutilized in our best interest and to avoid or mitigate conflicts that may arise in the future for Pete O’Heeron as an individual stockholder employee.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware Law\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing another party\nfrom acquiring control of us and encouraging persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals to negotiate with our board of directors rather\nthan pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. These provisions include the items described below.\nClassified Board\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires our board of directors to be divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, with one class elected\neach year. The classification of directors has the effect of making it more difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors.\nStockholder Actions by Written Consent\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires that, any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly-called annual or\nspecial meeting of our stockholders and may not be effected by written consent in lieu of a meeting.\nAdvance Notice Requirements\nOur bylaws establish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business to be\nbrought before meetings of our stockholders. These procedures specify that notice of stockholder proposals must be timely given in writing to our corporate secretary prior to\nthe meeting at which the action is to be taken, and define what is considered timely. Our bylaws specify the requirements as to form and content of all stockholder notices.\nThese requirements may preclude stockholders from bringing matters before the stockholders at an annual or special meeting.\nDirector Removal and Vacancies\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires that, a member of our board of directors or our entire board may only be removed for cause, and then only by the\naffirmative vote of the holders of at least 662/3% in voting power of our stock entitled to vote on such removal. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation requires that, any newly created directorship that results from an increase in the number of directors or any vacancy on our board of directors, must be filled\nsolely by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director and may not be filled by\nthe stockholders.\nSupermajority Voting Requirements\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662/3% in voting power of our stock entitled to vote thereon to (i)\namend, alter or repeal our bylaws and adopt new bylaws or (ii) to amend, alter, change or repeal, or adopt any provision inconsistent with, certain provisions of our certificate of\nincorporation, including the provisions relating to the requirement to have a classified board, the provisions relating to the removal of directors, the provision precluding\nstockholder action by written consent and the choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as explained below).\nUndesignated Preferred Stock\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for authorized shares of preferred stock. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock may\nenable our board of directors to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. For example, if in the due exercise\nof its fiduciary obligations, our board of directors were to determine that a takeover proposal is not in the best interests of our shareholders, our board of directors could cause\nshares of preferred stock to be issued without shareholder approval in one or more private offerings or other transactions that might dilute the voting or other rights of the\nproposed acquirer or insurgent shareholder or shareholder group. In this regard, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation grants our board of directors broad power\nto establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and\nassets available for distribution to holders of shares of common stock. The issuance may also adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of these holders\nand may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in our control.\nExclusive Forum\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the (i) Court of Chancery of the State\nof Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the\nsole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our\ndirectors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (c) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or\n(d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States of America\nshall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause or causes of action arising under the Securities Act, including all causes of action asserted\nagainst any defendant to such complaint. The foregoing provision would not preclude stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in\nfederal court, to the extent that the Exchange Act confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over such claims, subject to applicable law. Our choice of forum provision may impose\nadditional litigation costs on stockholders in pursuing claims and may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it believes to be favorable for\ndisputes with us or any of our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims.\nLimitation of Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers\nOur bylaws provide that our directors and officers will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law.\nThese provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of\nreducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders.\nFurthermore, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to\nthese indemnification provisions. We believe that these provisions and insurance are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced directors and officers. In addition,\nin connection with the Direct Listing, we entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers.\nSection 203 of the DGCL\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. This statute prevents certain Delaware corporations, under certain circumstances,\nfrom engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder.” In general, Section 203 defines an “interested stockholder” as an entity or person who, together\nwith the person’s affiliates and associates, beneficially owns 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation.\nA “business combination” includes a merger or sale of more than 10% of our assets. However, the above provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL do not apply if:\n● the business combination takes place more than three years after the interested stockholder became an “interested stockholder;”\n● our board of directors approves the transaction that made the stockholder an “interested stockholder” prior to the date of the transaction;\n● after the completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, that stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock\noutstanding, other than statutorily excluded shares of common stock; or\n● on or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at a meeting of our stockholders, and not\nby written consent, by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.\nListing\nOur Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “FBLG”.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is VStock Transfer LLC. The transfer agent and registrar’s address is 18 Lafayette Place, Woodmere, NY 11598. The\ntransfer agent and registrar can be contacted by phone at: (212) 828-8436.\nExhibit 14\nFibroBiologics, Inc.\nCode of Ethics and Business Conduct\n1. Introduction and Purpose.\n1.1 The Board of Directors of FibroBiologics, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) has adopted this Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the\n“Code”) in order to:\n(a) promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest;\n(b) promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and in other public communications made by the Company;\n(c) promote compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;\n(d) promote the protection of Company assets, including corporate opportunities and confidential information;\n(e) promote fair dealing practices;\n(f) deter wrongdoing; and\n(g) ensure accountability for adherence to the Code.\n1.2 All directors, officers and employees are required to be familiar with the Code, comply with its provisions and report any suspected violations as described below\nin Section 10, Reporting and Enforcement. The Company expects its directors, officers and employees to exercise reasonable judgment when conducting the Company’s\nbusiness. The Company encourages its directors, officers and employees to refer to the Code frequently to ensure that they are acting within both the letter and spirit of the\nCode. The Company also understands that the Code will not provide an answer to every problem you may encounter or address every concern you may have about conducting\nthe Company’s business ethically and legally. In these situations, or if you otherwise have questions or concerns about the Code, the Company encourages you to speak with\nyour supervisor (if applicable) or, if you are uncomfortable doing that, with the Chief Compliance Officer. Unless and until another Chief Compliance Officer is named, the\nChief Financial Officer shall serve in this capacity.\n2. Honest and Ethical Conduct.\n2.1 The Company’s policy is to promote high standards of integrity by conducting its affairs honestly and ethically.\n2.2 Each director, officer and employee must act with integrity and observe the highest ethical standards of business conduct in his or her dealings with the Company’s\ncustomers, suppliers, partners, service providers, competitors, employees and anyone else with whom he or she has contact in the course of performing his or her job.\n3. Conflicts of Interest.\n3.1 A conflict of interest occurs when an individual’s private interest (or the interest of a member of his or her family) interferes, or even appears to interfere, with the\ninterests of the Company as a whole. A conflict of interest can arise when an employee, officer or director (or a member of his or her family) takes actions or has interests that\nmay make it difficult to perform his or her work for the Company objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise when an employee, officer or director (or a member\nof his or her family) receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position in the Company.\n3.2 Loans by the Company to, or guarantees by the Company of obligations of, employees or their family members are of special concern and could constitute\nimproper personal benefits to the recipients of such loans or guarantees, depending on the facts and circumstances. Loans by the Company to, or guarantees by the Company of\nobligations of, any director, officer, or their family members are expressly prohibited.\n3.3 Whether or not a conflict of interest exists or will exist can be unclear. Conflicts of interest should be avoided unless specifically authorized as described in Section\n3.4.\n3.4 Persons other than directors and executive officers who have questions about a potential conflict of interest or who become aware of an actual or potential conflict\nshould discuss the matter with, and seek a determination and prior authorization or approval from, their supervisor or the Chief Compliance Officer. A supervisor may not\nauthorize or approve conflict of interest matters or make determinations as to whether a problematic conflict of interest exists without first providing the Chief Compliance\nOfficer with a written description of the activity and seeking the Chief Compliance Officer’s written approval. If the supervisor is themself involved in the potential or actual\nconflict, the matter should instead be discussed directly with the Chief Compliance Officer.\n3.5 Directors and executive officers must seek determinations and prior authorizations or approvals of potential conflicts of interest exclusively from the Board of\nDirectors.\n4. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations.\n4.1 Employees, officers and directors should comply, both in letter and spirit, with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in the cities, states and countries in which\nthe Company operates.\n4.2 Although not all employees, officers and directors are expected to know the details of all applicable laws, rules and regulations, it is important to know enough to\ndetermine when to seek advice from appropriate personnel. Questions about compliance should be addressed to the Legal Department. Until the Company hires General\nCounsel and establishes a Legal Department, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer together shall serve as the Legal Department.\n4.3 No director, officer or employee may purchase or sell any Company securities while in possession of material nonpublic information regarding the Company, nor\nmay any director, officer or employee purchase or sell another company’s securities while in possession of material nonpublic information regarding that company. It is against\nCompany policies and illegal for any director, officer or employee to use material nonpublic information regarding the Company or any other company to:\n(a) obtain profit for himself or herself; or\n(b) directly or indirectly “tip” others who might make an investment decision on the basis of that information.\n4.4 The Company does not permit or condone bribes, kickbacks or other improper payments, transfers or receipts. No director, officer or employee should offer, give,\nsolicit or receive any money or other item of value for the purpose of obtaining, retaining or directing business or bestowing or receiving any kind of favored treatment.\n4.5 Many countries regulate international trade transactions, such as imports, exports and international financial transactions and prohibit boycotts against countries or\nfirms that may be “blacklisted” by certain groups or countries. The Company’s policy is to comply with these regulations and prohibitions even if compliance may result in the\nloss of some business opportunities. Employees should learn and understand the extent to which international trade controls apply to transactions conducted by the Company.\n5. Disclosure.\n5.1 The Company’s periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC, including all financial statements and other financial information, must comply with\napplicable federal securities laws and SEC rules.\n5.2 Each director, officer and employee who contributes in any way to the preparation or verification of the Company’s financial statements and other financial\ninformation must ensure that the Company’s books, records and accounts are accurately maintained. Each director, officer and employee must cooperate fully with the\nCompany’s accounting and internal audit departments, as well as the Company’s independent public accountants and counsel.\n5.3 Each director, officer and employee who is involved in the Company’s disclosure process must:\n(a) be familiar with and comply with the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting; and\n(b) take all necessary steps to ensure that all filings with the SEC and all other public communications about the financial and business condition of the\nCompany provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure.\n6. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets.\n6.1 All directors, officers and employees should protect the Company’s assets and ensure their efficient use. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on the\nCompany’s profitability and are prohibited.\n6.2 All Company assets should be used only for legitimate business purposes. Any suspected incident of fraud or theft should be reported for investigation\nimmediately.\n6.3 The obligation to protect Company assets includes the Company’s proprietary information. Proprietary information includes intellectual property such as trade\nsecrets, patents, trademarks, and copyrights, as well as business and marketing plans, engineering and manufacturing ideas, designs, databases, records and any nonpublic\nfinancial data or reports. Unauthorized use or distribution of this information is prohibited and could also be illegal and result in civil or criminal penalties.\n6.4 Business contributions to political campaigns are strictly regulated by federal, state, provincial and local law in the U.S. and many other jurisdictions. Accordingly,\nall political contributions proposed to be made with the Company’s funds must be coordinated through and approved by the Chief Compliance Officer. Directors, officers and\nemployees may not, without the approval of the Chief Compliance Officer, use any Company funds for political contributions of any kind to any political candidate or holder of\nany national, state or local government office. Directors, officers and employees may make personal contributions, but should not represent that they are making contributions\non the Company’s behalf. Specific questions should be directed to the Chief Compliance Officer.\n7. Corporate Opportunities. All directors, officers and employees owe a duty to the Company to advance its interests when the opportunity arises. Directors, officers and\nemployees are prohibited from taking for themselves personally (or for the benefit of friends or family members) opportunities that are discovered through the use of Company\nassets, property, information or position. Directors, officers and employees may not use Company assets, property, information or position for personal gain (including gain of\nfriends or family members). In addition, no director, officer or employee may compete with the Company.\n8. Confidentiality.\n8.1 Directors, officers and employees should maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted to them by the Company or by its customers, suppliers or partners,\nexcept when disclosure is expressly authorized or is required or permitted by law. Confidential information includes all nonpublic information (regardless of its source) that\nmight be of use to the Company’s competitors or harmful to the Company or its customers, suppliers or partners if disclosed.\n8.2 Employees should take appropriate precautions to ensure that confidential or sensitive business information, whether it is proprietary to the Company or another\ncompany, is not communicated within the Company except to employees who have a need to know such information to perform their responsibilities for the Company. Subject\nto the exceptions in this Code, employees, officers and directors (other than the Company’s authorized spokespersons) must not discuss internal Company matters with, or\ndisseminate internal Company information to, anyone outside the Company, except as required in the performance of their Company duties and, if appropriate, after a\nconfidentiality agreement is in place.\n8.3 The prohibition in the preceding paragraph applies particularly to inquiries concerning the Company from the media, market professionals (such as securities\nanalysts, institutional investors, investment advisers, brokers and dealers) and security holders. All responses to inquiries on behalf of the Company must be made only by the\nCompany’s authorized spokespersons.\n8.4 All employees must abide by any lawful obligations that owed to former employers. These obligations may include restrictions on the use and disclosure of\nconfidential information, restrictions on the solicitation of former colleagues to work at the Company and non-competition obligations.\n9. Fair Dealing. Each director, officer and employee must deal fairly with the Company’s customers, suppliers, partners, service providers, competitors, employees and anyone\nelse with whom he or she has contact in the course of performing his or her job. No director, officer or employee may take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation,\nconcealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of facts or any other unfair dealing practice.\n10. Reporting and Enforcement.\n10.1 Reporting and Investigation of Violations.\n(a) Actions prohibited by this Code involving directors or executive officers must be reported to the Board of Directors.\n(b) Actions prohibited by this Code involving anyone other than a director or executive officer must be reported to the reporting person’s supervisor or the\nChief Compliance Officer.\n(c) After receiving a report of an alleged prohibited action, the Board of Directors, the relevant supervisor, or the Chief Compliance Officer must promptly\ntake all appropriate actions necessary to investigate.\n(d) All directors, officers and employees are expected to cooperate in any internal investigation of misconduct.\n10.2 Enforcement.\n(a) The Company must ensure prompt and consistent action against violations of this Code.\n(b) If, after investigating a report of an alleged prohibited action by a director or executive officer, the Board of Directors determines that a violation of\nthis Code has occurred, the Board of Directors will report such determination to the Board of Directors.\n(c) If, after investigating a report of an alleged prohibited action by any other person, the relevant supervisor or the Chief Compliance Officer determines\nthat a violation of this Code has occurred, the relevant supervisor or Chief Compliance Officer will report such determination to the General Counsel.\n(d) Upon receipt of a determination that there has been a violation of this Code, the Board of Directors or the General Counsel will take such preventative\nor disciplinary action as it deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, reassignment, demotion, dismissal and, in the event of criminal conduct or other serious\nviolations of the law, notification of appropriate governmental authorities.\n10.3 Waivers.\n(a) Each of the Board of Directors (in the case of a violation by a director or executive officer) and the General Counsel (in the case of a violation by any\nother person) may, in its discretion, waive any violation of this Code.\n(b) Any waiver for a director or an executive officer shall be disclosed as required by SEC and Nasdaq rules.\n10.4 Prohibition on Retaliation.\nThe Company does not tolerate acts of retaliation against any director, officer or employee who makes a good faith report of known or suspected acts of\nmisconduct or other violations of this Code.\nAdopted by the Board: June 20, 2023.\nExhibit 23.2\nFebruary 16, 2024\nSummary of animal study results from Howard An, M.D., Director, Spine Fellowship Program, Rush University Medical College:\nOur studies have shown that this biological treatment using human dermal fibroblast cells, has great potential as a cell therapy for disc degeneration. When these cells\nwere injected into a degenerating rabbit disc, they were retained in the disc for up to 8 weeks. Collagen Type II gene expression, a marker for disc repair and\nregeneration, was higher in the discs treated with human dermal fibroblast cells than those in the control treatment. Also higher in the cell treated discs were the disc\nheights and cell number. Together, this data suggests that human dermal fibroblast cells are a promising option for cell therapy to restore the biological function and\nreduce symptoms of intermediate or progressive degenerative discs.\nI approve for Fibrobiologics, Inc. to use this statement for its SEC filings.\nHoward S.

SECTION 1350\nWith reference to the Annual Report of FibroBiologics, Inc. (the “Company”), on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and\nExchange Commission on the date hereof (the “Report”), I, Pete O’Heeron, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Mark Andersen, Chief Financial Officer of the\nCompany, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1350, as adopted pursuant to § 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that to my knowledge:\n1) The Report fully complies with the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and\n2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\n/s/ Pete O’Heeron\nPete O’Heeron\nChief Executive Officer\n/s/ Mark Andersen\nMark Andersen\nChief Financial Officer\nDate: February 29, 2024\nExhibit 97\nFibroBiologics, Inc.\nClawback Policy\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of FibroBiologics, Inc. (the “Company”) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to create and\nmaintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Company’s pay-for-performance compensation philosophy. The Board has therefore\nadopted this policy which provides for the recoupment of certain executive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with\nfinancial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws (the “Policy”). This Policy is designed to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n(the “Exchange Act”) and the requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq”).\nAdministration\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so designated by the Board, the Compensation Committee, in which case references herein to the Board shall be deemed\nreferences to the Compensation Committee. Any determinations made by the Board shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nCovered Executives\nThis Policy applies to the Company’s current and former executive officers, as determined by the Board in accordance with Section 10D of the Exchange Act and the listing\nstandards of the Nasdaq (“Covered Executives”).\nRecoupment; Accounting Restatement\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting\nrequirement under the securities laws, the Board will require reimbursement or forfeiture reasonably promptly of any erroneously awarded Incentive Compensation received by\nany Covered Executive during the three (3) completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement and\nduring any transition period that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year within or immediately following those three (3) completed fiscal years; however, a\ntransition period between the last day of the Company’s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine (9) to 12 months would\nbe deemed a completed fiscal year.\nThe accounting restatement includes any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued\nfinancial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. The Company’s\nobligation to recover erroneously awarded compensation is not dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are filed.\nIncentive Compensation\nFor purposes of this Policy, Incentive Compensation means any of the following erroneously awarded (provided that, such compensation is granted, earned, or vested based\nwholly or in part on the attainment of a financial reporting measure), and any earnings accrued to date on such amount:\n● Annual bonuses and other short- and long-term cash incentives.\n● Stock options.\n● Stock appreciation rights.\n● Restricted stock.\n● Restricted stock units.\n● Performance shares.\n● Performance units.\nFinancial reporting measures include:\n● Company stock price.\n● Total shareholder return.\n● Revenues.\n● Net income.\n● Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\n● Funds from operations.\n● Liquidity measures such as working capital or operating cash flow.\n● Return measures such as return on invested capital or return on assets.\n● Earnings measures such as earnings per share.\nErroneously Awarded Incentive Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery\nThe amount to be recovered will be the excess of the Incentive Compensation paid to the Covered Executive based on the erroneous data over the Incentive Compensation that\nwould have been paid to the Covered Executive had it been based on the restated amounts, computed on a gross (not after-tax) basis, as determined by the Board.\nIf the Board cannot determine the amount of excess Incentive Compensation received by the Covered Executive directly from the information in the accounting restatement,\nthen it will make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement. For Incentive Compensation based on stock price or total\nshareholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an accounting\nrestatement, the amount will be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the\nIncentive Compensation was received; and the Company will maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and, if required, provide such\ndocumentation to the Nasdaq.\n2\nMethod of Recoupment\nThe Board will determine, in its sole discretion, the method for recouping Incentive Compensation hereunder which may include, without limitation:\n(a) requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive Compensation previously paid;\n(b) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards;\n(c) offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive;\n(d)) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\n(e) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Board.\nNo Indemnification\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any incorrectly awarded Incentive Compensation.\nInterpretation\nThe Board is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. It is\nintended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or standards adopted\nby the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or the Nasdaq.\nEffective Date\nThis Policy shall be effective as of the date it is adopted by the Board (the “Effective Date”) and shall apply to Incentive Compensation that is approved, awarded or granted to\nCovered Executives on or after that date.\nAmendment; Termination\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to reflect final regulations adopted by the SEC under\nSection 10D of the Exchange Act and to comply with any rules or standards adopted by the Nasdaq. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time.\nOther Recoupment Rights\nThe Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Board may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar\nagreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the terms of\nthis Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company\npursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the\nCompany.\nImpracticability\nThe Board shall recover any excess Incentive Compensation in accordance with this Policy unless such recovery would be impracticable, as determined by the committee of\nindependent directors responsible for executive compensation decisions, or a majority of the independent directors of the Board, in accordance with Rule 10D-1 of the\nExchange Act and the listing standards of the Nasdaq.\nSuccessors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\nAdopted by the Board: June 20, 2023\n3"
