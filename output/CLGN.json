regenerative and aesthetics medicine company developing innovative technologies and products based on its non-animal-derived collagen for tissue regeneration and medical aesthetics, today announced financial results for the third quarter ending September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n[ ![\"CollPlant's printed regenerative breast implant implantation procedure, as part of the preclinical trial\" \\(PRNewsfoto/CollPlant\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2568075/CollPlant.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2568075/CollPlant.html)\n\n\"We are now one step closer to advancing our breast implant program into human studies, after developing a biocompatible commercial-sized, 3D-printed implant with a natural feel that has shown promising results in preclinical trials,\" commented Yehiel Tal, Chief Executive Officer of CollPlant Biotechnologies. \"So far, the study is showing encouraging outcomes three months post implantation, with evidence of significant implant vascularization and rapid ingrowth of native tissue, both of which are critical factors in enabling effective integration of the implant with the physiological system and supporting long-lasting regenerative processes. We are looking forward to reporting additional results from this program in the first quarter of 2025. \"\n\nMr. Tal, continued, \"We have recently adjusted our development and operation plans so that the Company is capitalized for a period of at least one year from today. In addition, we are prioritizing raising non-dilutive cash through the creation of additional collaborations and to that end we are engaging in dialog with companies in the medical and aesthetics fields that have interest in our rhCollagen technology. \"\n\nDr. Sachin M. Shridharani, board-certified Plastic Surgeon, founder of LUXURGERY© New York and Associate Clinical Professor of Plastic Surgery at Washington University School of Medicine added, \"CollPlant's novel, 3D-printed, biocompatible and regenerative breast implant technology is an incredibly exciting development with multiple applications. There is an unmet need in aesthetic and reconstructive plastic surgery for highly biocompatible materials to be employed for breast augmentation and reconstruction. Eliminating immune responses to materials implanted in the breast or any portion of the body serves as a holy grail in plastic surgery.\"\n\n**Q3 and Recent Program Highlights**\n\n  * In August, CollPlant announced the launch of a pre-clinical study with 200cc commercial-sized breast implants printed using CollPlant's bioinks and Stratasys' (Nasdaq: SSYS) Origin 3D printer. The collaboration between CollPlant and Stratasys has been focused on the development of a bioprinting solution for CollPlant's regenerative breast implants. In addition, the companies aim to develop solutions for scaling-up the implant bioprinting process. If successfully developed, the novel implants could provide a revolutionary alternative to the implants that are currently on the market. \n  * To date, the study has shown promising results three months post implantation, demonstrating significant implant vascularization and rapid ingrowth of native tissue, both of which are critical factors in enabling effective integration of the implant with the physiological system and supporting long-lasting regenerative processes.\n\n\n\n**Collaboration Updates**\n\n  * The collaboration with AbbVie continues to develop a dermal and soft tissue filler product for the medical aesthetics market. According to the agreement between the parties, CollPlant granted AbbVie worldwide exclusive rights to use its rhCollagen for the production and commercialization of a final dermal filler product. In return, CollPlant is entitled to receive, among other terms, up to $50 million and a fixed-fee royalty payment for each product commercialized. As of today, $24 million has been paid to CollPlant. AbbVie is responsible for all the costs of the dermal and soft tissue filler product candidate development, including the costs of clinical trials.\n\n\n  * On November 11, 2024, CollPlant presented at the ISBF (International Society for Biofabrication) 2024 conference. ISBF is a professional society promoting biofabrication research and development for medical applications. During the conference, CollPlant demonstrated its technology platform for mass production of human collagen and biofabrication of its innovative regenerative breast implants. \n  * On July 29, 2024, CollPlant announced the release of its inaugural Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) and Sustainability Report covering the fiscal year 2023. The report reflects CollPlant's wide commitment to fostering environmental sustainability and enhancing human health, as well as advancing social and corporate governance objectives that contribute to the Company's impact.\n\n\n\n**Three- and Nine-Month-Period Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Results**\n\nGAAP revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $4,000 compared to $43,000 for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenues is mainly related to the decrease in sales of rhCollagen to the Company's largest customer. The deliveries to this customer are in accordance with the development plan of the customer, and in the third quarter no deliveries were planned or made. In accordance with the plan, CollPlant is prepared to supply rhCollagen to this customer this quarter, during December 2024.\n\nGAAP revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $351,000 compared to $10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The Company's products are based on its rhCollagen (recombinant human collagen) produced with CollPlant's proprietary plant-based genetic engineering technology. These products address indications for the diverse fields of tissue repair, aesthetics, and organ manufacturing, and are ushering in a new era in regenerative and aesthetic medicine.\n\nIn 2021, CollPlant entered into a development and global commercialization agreement for dermal and soft tissue fillers with Allergan, an AbbVie company, the global leader in the dermal filler market.\n\nFor more information about CollPlant, visit [http://www.collplant.com](http://www.collplant.com/)\n\n**Use of Non-US GAAP (\"non-GAAP\")**\n\nFinancial results for 2024 and 2023 are presented on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. GAAP results were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include all revenue and expenses recognized during the period. The release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures for operating costs and expenses, operating income (or loss), net income (or loss) and basic and diluted net income (or loss) per share that exclude the effects of non-cash expense for share-based compensation to employees, directors and consultants, and change in operating lease accounts. CollPlant's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance that enhances management's and investors' ability to evaluate the Company's operating costs, net income (or loss) and income (or loss) per share, and to compare them to historical Company results. \n\nThe presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when operating and evaluating the Company's business internally and therefore decided to make these non-GAAP adjustments available to investors. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company in this press release may be different from the measures used by other companies.\n\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this release.

This is an important milestone for us since currently there are no other commercial products that allow regeneration of soft tissues such as the breast. The previous pre-clinical results we've seen have been encouraging, such as tissue regeneration and vascularization, and we are looking forward to reporting more results in the fourth quarter of 2024 and in the first quarter of 2025.\"\n\nMr. Tal continued, \"We also released our first ESG and Sustainability report after establishing a corporate sustainability strategy with clear targets in key areas that we believe are crucial to our stakeholders. I would like to emphasize that our overall strategy is driven by our vision to lead in regenerative medicine and improve global health with our innovative collagen technology. This first report includes tangible steps we are taking towards enabling a sustainable future.\"\n\n**Q2 and Recent Program Highlights**\n\n  * Earlier in August, 2024, CollPlant and Stratasys Ltd. (Nasdaq: SSYS), a leader in polymer 3D printing solutions, announced the initiation of a pre-clinical study with CollPlant's 200cc commercial-sized implants printed on Stratasys' Origin 3D printer. The collaboration between CollPlant and Stratasys is currently focused on the development of a bioprinting solution for CollPlant's breast implants, in addition to finding solutions to scale-up the implant's fabrication process. If successfully developed, the novel implants could provide a revolutionary alternative to the implants that are currently on the market. \n  * In June, 2024, CollPlant announced that it successfully printed for the first time, 200 cc-sized regenerative breast implants, the same size that are now in pre-clinical testing with Stratasys. CollPlant also announced additional, positive, interim preclinical data from ongoing large-animal studies, evaluating its regenerative breast implants.\n\n\n\n**ESG Updates**\n\nIn July, 2024, CollPlant announced the release of its inaugural Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) and Sustainability Report covering the fiscal year 2023.\n\nCollPlant's first report details the initiatives that it has taken to adopt an ESG strategy with a focus on the pillars that represent the areas with the highest impact. By aligning the Company's operations with its ethical commitments, the Company plans to enhance plant-based production, reduce emissions, and deliver safe and reliable medical solutions. The report reflects CollPlant's wide commitment to fostering environmental sustainability and enhancing human health, as well as advancing social and corporate governance objectives that contribute to the Company's impact.\n\n**Three and Six Month-Period Ended June 30, 2024 Financial Results**\n\nGAAP revenues for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024, were $249,000 compared to $10.2 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023.

The Company's products are based on its rhCollagen (recombinant human collagen) produced with CollPlant's proprietary plant-based genetic engineering technology. These products address indications for the diverse fields of tissue repair, aesthetics, and organ manufacturing, and are ushering in a new era in regenerative and aesthetic medicine.\n\nIn 2021, CollPlant entered into a development and global commercialization agreement for dermal and soft tissue fillers with Allergan, an AbbVie company, the global leader in the dermal filler market.\n\nFor more information about CollPlant, visit [http://www.collplant.com](http://www.collplant.com/)\n\n**Use of Non-US GAAP (\"non-GAAP\")**\n\nFinancial results for 2024 and 2023 are presented on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. GAAP results were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include all revenue and expenses recognized during the period. The release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures for operating costs and expenses, operating income (or loss), net income (or loss) and basic and diluted net income (or loss) per share that exclude the effects of non-cash expense for share-based compensation to employees, directors and consultants, and change in operating lease accounts. CollPlant's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance that enhances management's and investors' ability to evaluate the Company's operating costs, net income (or loss) and income (or loss) per share, and to compare them to historical Company results. \n\nThe presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when operating and evaluating the Company's business internally and therefore decided to make these non-GAAP adjustments available to investors. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company in this press release may be different from the measures used by other companies.\n\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this release. This accompanying table has more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\n\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements for the first quarter ended June 30, 2024, are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\nThis press release may include forward-looking statements.

vascularization and rapid ingrowth of native tissue_\n\n_-Innovative breast implant technology designed to address a $3.0 billion market opportunity_\n\n_-Cash and cash equivalents balance as of September 30, 2024 was $15.4 million_\n\n_-Conference call to be held today at 10:00 a.m. U.S. EDT –_\n\nREHOVOT, Israel, Nov. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CollPlant Biotechnologies (Nasdaq: CLGN), a regenerative and aesthetics medicine company developing innovative technologies and products based on its non-animal-derived collagen for tissue regeneration and medical aesthetics, today announced financial results for the third quarter ending September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n[ ![\"CollPlant's printed regenerative breast implant implantation procedure, as part of the preclinical trial\" \\(PRNewsfoto/CollPlant\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2568075/CollPlant.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2568075/CollPlant.html)\n\n\"We are now one step closer to advancing our breast implant program into human studies, after developing a biocompatible commercial-sized, 3D-printed implant with a natural feel that has shown promising results in preclinical trials,\" commented Yehiel Tal, Chief Executive Officer of CollPlant Biotechnologies. \"So far, the study is showing encouraging outcomes three months post implantation, with evidence of significant implant vascularization and rapid ingrowth of native tissue, both of which are critical factors in enabling effective integration of the implant with the physiological system and supporting long-lasting regenerative processes. We are looking forward to reporting additional results from this program in the first quarter of 2025. \"\n\nMr. Tal, continued, \"We have recently adjusted our development and operation plans so that the Company is capitalized for a period of at least one year from today. In addition, we are prioritizing raising non-dilutive cash through the creation of additional collaborations and to that end we are engaging in dialog with companies in the medical and aesthetics fields that have interest in our rhCollagen technology. \"\n\nDr. Sachin M. Shridharani, board-certified Plastic Surgeon, founder of LUXURGERY© New York and Associate Clinical Professor of Plastic Surgery at Washington University School of Medicine added, \"CollPlant's novel, 3D-printed, biocompatible and regenerative breast implant technology is an incredibly exciting development with multiple applications. There is an unmet need in aesthetic and reconstructive plastic surgery for highly biocompatible materials to be employed for breast augmentation and reconstruction. Eliminating immune responses to materials implanted in the breast or any portion of the body serves as a holy grail in plastic surgery.\"\n\n**Q3 and Recent Program Highlights**\n\n  * In August, CollPlant announced the launch of a pre-clinical study with 200cc commercial-sized breast implants printed using CollPlant's bioinks and Stratasys' (Nasdaq: SSYS) Origin 3D printer. The collaboration between CollPlant and Stratasys has been focused on the development of a bioprinting solution for CollPlant's regenerative breast implants. In addition, the companies aim to develop solutions for scaling-up the implant bioprinting process. If successfully developed, the novel implants could provide a revolutionary alternative to the implants that are currently on the market. \n  * To date, the study has shown promising results three months post implantation, demonstrating significant implant vascularization and rapid ingrowth of native tissue, both of which are critical factors in enabling effective integration of the implant with the physiological system and supporting long-lasting regenerative processes.\n\n\n\n**Collaboration Updates**\n\n  * The collaboration with AbbVie continues to develop a dermal and soft tissue filler product for the medical aesthetics market. According to the agreement between the parties, CollPlant granted AbbVie worldwide exclusive rights to use its rhCollagen for the production and commercialization of a final dermal filler product. In return, CollPlant is entitled to receive, among other terms, up to $50 million and a fixed-fee royalty payment for each product commercialized. As of today, $24 million has been paid to CollPlant. AbbVie is responsible for all the costs of the dermal and soft tissue filler product candidate development, including the costs of clinical trials.\n\n\n  * On November 11, 2024, CollPlant presented at the ISBF (International Society for Biofabrication) 2024 conference. ISBF is a professional society promoting biofabrication research and development for medical applications. During the conference, CollPlant demonstrated its technology platform for mass production of human collagen and biofabrication of its innovative regenerative breast implants. \n  * On July 29, 2024, CollPlant announced the release of its inaugural Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) and Sustainability Report covering the fiscal year 2023. The report reflects CollPlant's wide commitment to fostering environmental sustainability and enhancing human health, as well as advancing social and corporate governance objectives that contribute to the Company's impact.\n\n\n\n**Three- and Nine-Month-Period Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Results**\n\nGAAP revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $4,000 compared to $43,000 for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenues is mainly related to the decrease in sales of rhCollagen to the Company's largest customer. The deliveries to this customer are in accordance with the development plan of the customer, and in the third quarter no deliveries were planned or made.

The Company's products are based on its rhCollagen (recombinant human collagen) produced with CollPlant's proprietary plant-based genetic engineering technology. These products address indications for the diverse fields of tissue repair, aesthetics, and organ manufacturing, and are ushering in a new era in regenerative and aesthetic medicine.\n\nIn 2021, CollPlant entered into a development and global commercialization agreement for dermal and soft tissue fillers with Allergan, an AbbVie company, the global leader in the dermal filler market.\n\nFor more information about CollPlant, visit [http://www.collplant.com](http://www.collplant.com/)\n\n**Use of Non-US GAAP (\"non-GAAP\")**\n\nFinancial results for 2024 and 2023 are presented on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. GAAP results were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include all revenue and expenses recognized during the period. The release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures for operating costs and expenses, operating income (or loss), net income (or loss) and basic and diluted net income (or loss) per share that exclude the effects of non-cash expense for share-based compensation to employees, directors and consultants, and change in operating lease accounts. CollPlant's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance that enhances management's and investors' ability to evaluate the Company's operating costs, net income (or loss) and income (or loss) per share, and to compare them to historical Company results. \n\nThe presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when operating and evaluating the Company's business internally and therefore decided to make these non-GAAP adjustments available to investors.
