(Nasdaq: POCI) (the \"Company\"), a leading designer and manufacturer of advanced optical instruments for the medical and defense/aerospace industries, today announced an initial $340,000 production order from a large, global medical device company to provide initial stocking quantities of a new single-use ophthalmic endoscope.\n\nProduction is scheduled to begin in January 2025 and proceed over the following five months, to provide starting inventory levels to support product launch currently expected to occur around June 2025. The Company expects follow-on orders to support first year requirements after launch with delivery rates two to three times those of this initial stocking order. The companies have previously entered into a licensing agreement that sets terms under which POC will manufacture the product or receive royalties if the product is manufactured by the customer or a third-party.\n\n“This initial order is the culmination of more than five years of joint product development,” commented Dr. Joe Forkey, CEO of Precision Optics. “We expect either additional follow-on production orders that would be manufactured at POC facilities, or alternatively, royalties with similar bottom line economics should manufacturing be transferred to a non-POC facility. This product replaces our customer’s current re-usable endoscope-based system which has been on the market for over ten years. With the benefits of significantly improved image quality combined with single-use functionality, we believe this product will not only replace our customer’s existing product but has great potential to increase their market share in the ophthalmic market with the potential, over time, to be a significant opportunity for our customer and POC, in partnership.”\n\n“This order, along with the $9 million, single-use cystoscope imaging assembly production order for another customer announced earlier this year, represents a significant milestone in POC’s strategic plan for future growth. For many years we have been developing technology and expertise to support the market shift to single-use endoscopy. These two products are the first of a number of programs in our product development pipeline that address the new design and manufacturing requirements for this high growth market segment. The transition of both of these programs to production this year further confirms the value of POC’s unique intellectual property and know-how in both the design and production of single-use endoscopes,” Dr. Forkey continued.\n\nProduction orders for both single-use programs represent incremental year-over-year revenue increases and are significant contributors to the Company’s optimism for fiscal year 2025 performance. More importantly, the successful development and transition to production of these two programs validates the investments the Company has made to position POC to become the provider of choice for single-use programs into the future.\n\n“With multiple additional single-use programs in our product development pipeline and with a great response from potential new customers to our recent marketing messaging around this product category, we believe this is only the beginning of significant revenue growth driven by additional programs in this business area,” Dr. Forkey concluded.\n\n**About Precision Optics Corporation** Founded in 1982, Precision Optics is a vertically integrated optics company primarily focused on leveraging its proprietary micro-optics and 3D imaging technologies to the healthcare and defense/aerospace industries by providing services ranging from new product concept through mass manufacture.

(NASDAQ: POCI), a leading designer and manufacturer of advanced optical instruments for the medical and defense/aerospace industries, announced operating results on an unaudited basis for its first quarter fiscal year 2025 for the period ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Q1 2025 Financial Highlights (3 Months Ended September 30, 2024):**\n\n  * Revenue was $4.2 million compared to $4.3 million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year and in line with the expectations provided in September 2024.\n  * Engineering revenue was $1.9 million compared to $1.9 million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.\n  * Production revenue was $2.3 million compared to $2.4 million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.\n  * Gross margins were 26.6% compared to 33.9% in the same quarter of the previous year.\n  * Net loss for the quarter was ($1.3) million, compared to $(0.5) million in the same quarter of the previous year. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $(1.0) million for the quarter compared to $(0.2) million in the same quarter of the previous year. \n\n\n\n**Recent Additional Highlights:**\n\n  * In October 2024, following FDA 510(k) clearance by its customer for a single-use urological endoscope imaging assembly, POC accelerated the timeline for production deliveries against a $9 million order announced in May 2024. POC currently estimates approximately $3.6 million in product deliveries during its fiscal year ended June 2025.\n  * Today, POC announced receipt of an initial $340,000 production order from a large, global medical device company to provide initial stocking quantities of a new single-use ophthalmic endoscope. POC expects follow-on orders to support first year requirements after launch with delivery rates two to three times those of the initial stocking order.\n\n\n\nPrecision Optics' CEO, Joseph Forkey, commented, “The first quarter results that we released today were in line with the expectations we provided in September 2024. We are seeing a rapid ramp in production revenue commencing in the current quarter with expectations for substantial revenue growth and dramatic improvements in adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter ending December 31, 2024 and further improvements throughout this fiscal year.”\n\n“Anticipated sequential revenue growth will be driven by a number of product development programs transitioning into production or ramping from recent production levels. We continue to see acceleration of single-use applications. We now have two programs beginning production this year and additional single-use programs in our product development pipeline.”\n\n“We are at an inflection point leading to a high growth production business, building off of the investments we’ve made over many years to advance our single-use product solutions. This is an exciting time for Precision Optics,” Dr. Forkey concluded.\n\nThe following table summarizes the first quarter (unaudited) results for the periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023:\n\nThree Months  \n---  \nEnded September 30  \n2024| 2023  \nRevenues| $| 4,197,053| $| 4,321,255  \nGross Profit| 1,117,330| 1,463,611  \nStock Compensation Expenses| 149,364| 108,746  \nOther| 2,214,907| 1,760,158  \nTotal Operating Expenses| 2,364,271| 1,868,904  \nOperating Income (Loss)| (1,246,941| )| (405,293| )  \nNet Income (Loss)| (1,311,247| )| (464,415| )  \nIncome (Loss) per Share  \nBasic & Fully Diluted| $| (0.21| )| $| (0.08| )  \nWeighted Average Common Shares Outstanding  \nBasic & Fully Diluted| 6,216,630| 6,066,518  \n  \n**Conference Call Details** Date and Time: Thursday, November 14, at 5:00pm ET\n\nCall-in Information: Interested parties can access the conference call by dialing (844) 735-3662 or (412) 317-5705.\n\nLive Webcast Information: Interested parties can access the conference call via a live webcast, which is available at [https://app.webinar.net/rOVEypeYAoR](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fhrnMbR0dA4aH7yqLjVTeFYxy-YGnUlFGwllWaCYqAAa263rvN4TYvgCMKlJ7kzRfPKz7wACIljmWHW42xoJorSBmGwUaITt5IpYz0S_Z5L-tRiK52bwSa0Mxurc_1Bw).\n\nReplay: A teleconference replay of the call will be available until November 21, 2024, at (877) 344-7529 or (412) 317-0088, replay access code 7879688.

The non-GAAP financial measure is Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Adjusted EBITDA also excludes from Net Income (Loss) the effect of stock-based compensation AND DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND INTEREST EXPENSE.\n\nThis non-GAAP financial measure assists Precision Optics management in comparing its operating performance over time because certain items may obscure the underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult, as they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency or relate to discrete acquisition or restructuring plans that are fundamentally different from the ongoing productivity of the Company. Precision Optics management also believes that presenting this measure allows investors to view its performance using the same measures that the Company uses in evaluating its financial and business performance and trends.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure presented above to GAAP results has been provided in the financial tables included with this press release.\n\n**About Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that express the Company's intentions, beliefs, expectations, strategies, predictions or any other statements related to the Company's future activities or future events or conditions. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, without limitation, future levels of expected product deliveries and projections related to future EBITDA goals. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company's business based, in part, on assumptions made by the Company's management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.

(NASDAQ: POCI), a leading designer and manufacturer of advanced optical instruments for the medical and defense/aerospace industries, announced operating results on an unaudited basis for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**FY 2024 Financial Highlights (Year Ended June 30, 2024):**\n\n  * Revenue was $19.1 million compared to $21.0 million in the previous fiscal year. Revenue of $19.1 million, exceeded the high end of the expected range announced on August 14, 2024 of $18.9 million.\n  * Production revenue was $10.8 million, a decrease of 25% compared to the previous fiscal year.\n  * Engineering revenue was a record $8.3 million, an increase of 24% compared to the previous fiscal year.\n  * Gross margin was 30.3% compared to 36.8% in the previous fiscal year, which included a one-time sale of $600,000 in technology rights relating to a single-use medical device..\n  * Net loss was ($3.0) million which compared to net loss of ($0.1) million in the previous year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and other income, was $(1.6) million, compared to $0.5 million in the previous fiscal year.\n\n\n\n**Q4 FY2024 Financial Highlights (3 Months Ended June 30, 2024):**\n\n  * Revenue was $4.7 million compared to $5.0 million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. Revenue of $4.7 million exceeded the implied high end of the range we announced on August 14, 2024 of 4.5 million.\n  * Engineering revenue was $1.9 million compared to $1.4 million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.\n  * Production revenue was $2.8 million compared to $3.6 million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.\n  * Gross margins were 21.7% compared to 35.0% in the same quarter of the previous year.\n  * Net loss for the quarter was ($1.4) million, compared to $(0.1) million in the same quarter of the previous year.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $(1.1) million for the quarter compared to $(0.4) million in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\n\n\n**Recent Additional Highlights:**\n\n  * In May 2024, the Company announced the receipt of a $9 million production order for a high volume single-use cystoscopy surgery program. The program began production shipments of product in July, 2024.\n  * Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, in August 2024 the Company announced a closing of a $1.4 million registered direct offering of common stock, which included participation from directors and officers.\n\n\n\nPrecision Optics' CEO, Joseph Forkey, commented, “Upon exiting fiscal 2023, we were facing the loss of several significant programs that would not be continuing in fiscal 2024, totaling more than $7 million in annualized revenue. Due to the strength of our engineering pipeline, we backfilled a significant portion of the shortfall with record levels of product development revenue coupled with new products entering production. Currently several programs are transitioning from the development phase to production, including the program associated with the $9 million purchase order we announced in May. We have now reached a new phase for the Company, with a sizeable and growing base of production programs and product development revenue continuing at the record levels we achieved last year.”\n\n“As we look forward to fiscal 2025, we expect our first quarter revenue will be in the range of $4.2 to $4.4 million, relatively flat compared to the previous year’s first quarter. Revenue for the first quarter was impacted by certain challenges in the start-up and ramp of key production programs.

Utilizing its leading-edge in-house design, prototype, regulatory and fabrication capabilities as well as its Lighthouse Imaging division's electronic imaging expertise and its Ross Optical division's high volume world-wide sourcing, inspecting and production resources, the Company designs and manufactures next-generation product solutions for the most challenging customer requirements. Within healthcare, Precision Optics enables next generation medical device companies around the world to meet the increasing demands of the surgical community who require more enhanced and smaller imaging systems for minimally invasive surgery, including single-use medical devices, as well as 3D endoscopy systems to support the rapid proliferation of surgical robotic systems. In addition to these next generation applications, Precision Optics has supplied top tier medical device companies with a wide variety of optical products for decades, including complex endocouplers and specialized endoscopes. The Company is also leveraging its technical proficiency in micro-optics to enable leading edge defense/aerospace applications which require the highest quality standards and the optimization of size, weight and power.

The non-GAAP financial measure is Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Adjusted EBITDA also excludes from Net Income (Loss) the effect of stock-based compensation, restructuring and other acquisition-related items.\n\nThis non-GAAP financial measure assists Precision Optics management in comparing its operating performance over time because certain items may obscure the underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult, as they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency or relate to discrete acquisition or restructuring plans that are fundamentally different from the ongoing productivity of the Company. Precision Optics management also believes that presenting this measure allows investors to view its performance using the same measures that the Company uses in evaluating its financial and business performance and trends.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure presented above to GAAP results has been provided in the financial tables included with this press release.\n\n**About Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that express the Company's intentions, beliefs, expectations, strategies, predictions or any other statements related to the Company's future activities or future events or conditions. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company's business based, in part, on assumptions made by the Company's management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to numerous risk factors, including those risks discussed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K and in other documents that we file from time to time with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required by law.\n\n**Company Contact:** PRECISION OPTICS CORPORATION22 East BroadwayGardner, Massachusetts 01440-3338Telephone: 978-630-1800\n\n**Investor Contact:** LYTHAM PARTNERS, LLCRobert BlumTelephone: 602-889-9700[poci@lythampartners.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=D5YXTdO41yCa5PWRD8t1hQpjSq_8BdZ8ba-20mCfw8UwB9DOzLx4SgypRv22BJEQneVHX6leuBk1dal_EuB7FPhzL-f5_5hkqb2xriIciSw= \"poci@lythampartners.com\")\n\n**PRECISION OPTICS CORPORATION, INC.****Consolidated Balance Sheets at June 30, 2024 and 2023**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**ASSETS**  \nCurrent Assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 405,278| $| 2,925,852  \nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $118,872 at June 30, 2024 and $606,715 at June 30, 2023| 3,545,491| 3,907,407  \nInventories| 2,868,100| 2,776,216  \nPrepaid expenses| 299,364| 249,681  \nTotal current assets| 7,118,233| 9,859,156  \nFixed Assets:  \nMachinery and equipment| 3,341,194| 3,227,481  \nLeasehold improvements| 810,914| 825,752  \nFurniture and fixtures| 416,425| 242,865  \n4,568,533| 4,296,098  \nLess—Accumulated depreciation and amortization| 4,074,960| 3,862,578  \nNet fixed assets| 493,573| 433,520  \nOperating lease right-of-use asset| 189,999| 358,437  \nPatents, net| 286,559| 265,111  \nGoodwill| 8,824,210| 8,824,210  \nTOTAL ASSETS| $| 16,912,574| $| 19,740,434  \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY**  \nCurrent Liabilities:  \nRevolving line of credit| $| 1,000,000| $| -  \nCurrent portion of capital lease obligation| 41,113| 43,209  \nCurrent maturities of long-term debt| 276,928| 513,259  \nAccounts payable| 1,397,313| 2,432,264  \nCustomer advances| 1,172,350| 1,174,690  \nAccrued compensation and other| 840,662| 927,521  \nOperating lease liability| 178,450| 168,677  \nTotal current liabilities| 4,906,816| 5,259,620  \nCapital lease obligation, net of current portion| 27,369| 68,482  \nLong-term debt, net of current maturities| 1,899,052| 2,175,980  \nOperating lease liability, net of current portion| 11,549| 189,760  \nStockholders’ Equity:  \nCommon stock, $0.01 par value: 50,000,000 shares authorized;
