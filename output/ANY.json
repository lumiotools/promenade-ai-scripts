Business\n\nOverview\n\nSphere 3D was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) on May 2, 2007 as T.B. Mining Ventures Inc. On March 24, 2015, we completed a short-form amalgamation with a wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with the short-form amalgamation, we changed our name to ‚ÄúSphere 3D Corp.‚Äù Any reference to the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù, ‚ÄúSphere 3D‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, or similar terms refers to Sphere 3D Corp. and its subsidiaries. In December 2014, we completed the acquisition of Overland Storage, Inc. (‚ÄúOverland‚Äù) to grow our business in the containerization and virtualization technologies along with data management products that enabled workload-optimized solutions. In November 2018, we sold our Overland business. In January 2022, we commenced operations of our Bitcoin mining business and are dedicated to becoming a leader in the Blockchain and Crypto Industry. We have established and plan to continue to grow an enterprise-scale mining operation through the procurement of mining equipment and partnering with experienced service providers. On December 28, 2023, we sold our service and product segment which included HVE ConneXions and Unified ConneXions. See additional information below.\n\nDigital assets and blockchain\n\nBitcoin is a digital asset issued by and transmitted through an open source protocol maintained by a peer-to-peer network of decentralized user nodes. This network hosts a public transaction ledger blockchain where the digital assets and their corresponding transactions are recorded. The digital assets are stored in individual wallets with public addresses and a private key that controls access. The blockchain is updated without a single owner or operator of the network. New digital assets are generated and mined rewarding users after transactions are verified in the blockchain. \n\n1\n\nDigital assets and their corresponding markets emulate fiat currency exchange markets, such as the U.S. dollar, where they can be exchanged to various fiat currencies on trading exchanges. In addition, several markets such as derivative markets, exist for enhanced trading. Since the nature of digital assets is such that it exists solely in electronic form, they are exposed to risks similar to that of any data held solely in electronic form such as power failure, data corruption, cyber security attacks, and protocol breaches, among others. Since blockchain relies on open source developers to maintain the digital asset protocols, it may be subject to other risks associated with open source software.\n\nDigital currencies serve multiple purposes - a medium of exchange, store of value or unit of account. Examples of digital currencies include: Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Digital currencies are decentralized currencies that facilitate instant transfers. Transactions occur on an open source platform using peer-to-peer direct technology with no single owner. Blockchain is a public transaction ledger where transactions are recorded and tracked, however are not owned nor managed by one single entity. Blockchain, accessible and open to all, contains records of all existing and historical transactions. All accounts on the blockchain have a unique public key and is secured with a private key that is only known to the individual. The combination of private and public keys results in a secure digital ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù which results in a strong control of ownership.\n\nWe believe cryptocurrencies have many advantages over traditional, physical fiat currencies, including immediate settlement, fraud deterrent as they are unable to be duplicated or counterfeited, lower fees, mass accessibility, decentralized nature, transparency of transactions, identity theft prevention, physical loss prevention, no devaluation due to dilution, no counterparty risk, no intermediary facilitation, no arduous exchange rate implications and a strong confirmation transaction process. \n\nDigital Mining\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, our Digital Mining business segment operated approximately 12,800 miners with a total hash rate capacity of 1.3 exahash per second (‚ÄúEH/s‚Äù). We have an additional 730 machines that are awaiting deployment. In 2023, we mined 667.4 Bitcoin, which represented an increase of 409% over the 131.01 Bitcoin we mined in 2022. Based on our existing operations and expected deployment of miners we have purchased, we anticipate having approximately 1.4 EH/s of total hash rate in operation during 2024.\n\nOur Bitcoin mining operations are focused on maximizing our ability to successfully mine Bitcoin by growing our hash rate (the amount of computer power we devote to supporting the Bitcoin blockchain), to increase our chances of successfully creating new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain (a process known as ‚Äúsolving a block‚Äù). Generally, the greater share of the Bitcoin blockchain‚Äôs total network hash rate (the aggregate hash rate deployed to solving a block on the Bitcoin blockchain) a miner‚Äôs hash rate represents, the greater that miner‚Äôs chances of solving a block and, therefore, earning the block reward, which is currently 6.25 Bitcoin plus transaction fees per block (subject to periodic halving, as discussed below). As the proliferation of Bitcoin continues and the market price for Bitcoin increases, we expect additional miner operators to enter the market in response to an increased demand for Bitcoin which we anticipate to follow increased Bitcoin prices. As these new miner operators enter the market and as increasingly powerful miners are deployed in an attempt to solve a block, the Bitcoin blockchain‚Äôs network hash rate grows, meaning an existing miner must increase its hash rate at pace commensurate with the growth of network hash rate to maintain its relative chance of solving a block and earning a block reward. As we expect this trend to continue, we will need to continue growing our hash rate to compete in our dynamic and highly competitive industry.\n\nA key component of the Digital Mining business segment is to acquire highly specialized computer servers (known in the industry as ‚Äúminers‚Äù), which operate application-specific integrated circuit (‚ÄúASIC‚Äù) chips designed specifically to mine Bitcoin, and deploy such miners at-scale utilizing our hosting agreements. We believe ASIC miners are the most effective and energy-efficient miners available today, and we believe deploying them at-scale, including in quiet immersion-cooled environments, with their more efficient heat dissipation and reduced wear-and-tear compared to traditional air-cooled hardware, will enable us to continue growing our hash rate and optimize the output and longevity of our miners once they are deployed.\n\nAt this time, we intend only to mine Bitcoin and hold no other digital assets other than Bitcoin. We do not have any power purchase agreements for the supply of power.\n\n2\n\nMining Pools\n\nA ‚Äúmining pool‚Äù is a service operated by a mining pool operator that pools the resources of individual miners to share their processing power over a network. Mining pools emerged in response to the growing difficulty and network hash rate competing for Bitcoin rewards on the Bitcoin blockchain as a way of lowering costs and reducing the risk of an individual miner‚Äôs mining activities. The mining pool operator provides a service that coordinates the computing power of the independent mining enterprises participating in the mining pool. Mining pools are subject to various risks such as disruption and down time. In the event that a pool we utilize experiences down time or is not yielding returns, our results may be impacted.\n\nWe are engaged with digital asset mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining pools. In exchange for providing computing power, we are entitled to Full Pay Per Share (‚ÄúFPPS‚Äù), which is a fractional share of the fixed Bitcoin award the mining pool operator receives for successfully adding a block to the blockchain, plus a fractional share of the transaction fees attached to that blockchain less net Bitcoin mining fees due to the mining pool operator over the measurement period, as applicable. Our fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power we contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm.\n\nMaster Services Agreement\n\nOn August 19, 2021, we entered into a Master Services Agreement (the ‚ÄúGryphon MSA‚Äù) with Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. (‚ÄúGryphon‚Äù) under which Gryphon agreed to be the exclusive provider of any and all management services for all of our blockchain and cryptocurrency-related operations including but not limited to services relating to all mining equipment owned, purchased, leased, operated, or otherwise controlled by us at any location (collectively, the ‚ÄúServices‚Äù) unless the Gryphon MSA is terminated by us. On December 29, 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Gryphon MSA (the ‚ÄúGryphon MSA Amendment‚Äù) with Gryphon which extended the initial term of the Gryphon MSA to five years as we did not receive delivery of a specified minimum number of digital mining machines during 2022. Subject to written notice from us and an opportunity by Gryphon to cure for a period of up to 180 days, the Gryphon MSA provided us with the right to terminate the Gryphon MSA in the event of: (i) Gryphon‚Äôs failure to perform the Services under the Gryphon MSA in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with generally recognized digital mining industry standards for similar services, or (ii) Gryphon‚Äôs gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct in connection with performing the Services. Gryphon shall be entitled to specific performance or termination for cause in the event of a breach by us, subject to written notice and an opportunity to cure for a period of up to 180 days. As consideration for the Gryphon MSA, Gryphon shall receive the equivalent of 22.5% of the net operating profit, as defined in the Gryphon MSA, of all of our blockchain and digital currency related operations as a management fee. In addition, any costs Gryphon incurs on our behalf are to be reimbursed to Gryphon as defined in the Gryphon MSA. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we paid costs under the Gryphon MSA of $8.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\n\nOn April 7, 2023, we filed litigation against Gryphon outlining several breaches to the Gryphon MSA, including but not limited to, several fiduciary and operational breaches. On October 6, 2023, in accordance with the cure period, we terminated the Gryphon MSA. In November 2023, Gryphon indicated that upon receipt of certain information it would remit outstanding Bitcoin proceeds, less fees and expenses that we assert is currently held by Gryphon on behalf of us, which we believe amounts to approximately 21.6 Bitcoin and approximately $0.6 million of revenue at December 31, 2023, before factoring in fees and expenses. Due to the uncertainty regarding when we would receive the Bitcoin, the Bitcoin proceeds, less fees and expenses, will be recognized when received.\n\nHosting Sub-License\n\nOn October 5, 2021, we entered into a Sub-License and Delegation Agreement (‚ÄúHosting Sub-Lease‚Äù) with Gryphon, which assigned to us certain Master Services Agreement, dated as of September 12, 2021 (the ‚ÄúCore Scientific MSA‚Äù), by and between Core Scientific, Inc. (‚ÄúCore Scientific‚Äù), and Gryphon and Master Services Agreement Order #2 (‚ÄúOrder 2‚Äù). On December 29, 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Sub-Lease Agreement (the ‚ÄúSub-Lease Amendment‚Äù) with Gryphon to provide Gryphon the right to recapture the usage of up to 50% of the hosting capacity to be managed by Core Scientific. The agreement allows for approximately 230 MW of carbon neutral digital mining hosting capacity to be managed by Core Scientific as hosting partner. As part of the agreement, Core Scientific will provide digital mining fleet management and monitoring solution, Minder‚Ñ¢, data analytics, alerting, monitoring, and miner management services. The Hosting Sub-Lease shall automatically terminate upon the termination of the Core \n\n3\n\nScientific MSA and/or Order 2 in accordance with their respective terms. \n\nOn October 31, 2022, we filed an arbitration request against Core Scientific regarding the Hosting Sub-Lease. We have requested that certain advanced deposits paid be refunded back to us as a result of the modification to our machine purchase agreement with FuFu Technology Limited (now Ethereal Tech Pte. Ltd.). In December 2022, Core Scientific filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. \n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have a pre-paid deposit balance of $33.9 million towards the Hosting Sub-Lease, which we have recorded a $23.9 million provision for losses on the deposit due to Core Scientific‚Äôs Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in December 2022. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $8.2 million and $15.7 million, respectively, of expense included in provision for losses on deposits due to vendor bankruptcy filings on the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, we reached a settlement agreement (the ‚ÄúSettlement Agreement‚Äù) with Core Scientific, which was approved by a United States Bankruptcy Judge on January 16, 2024 as part of Core Scientific‚Äôs emergence from bankruptcy, for $10.0 million of Core Scientific‚Äôs equity. The Settlement Agreement includes access to potential additional funds for interest as well as an additional equity pool if the value of Core Scientific‚Äôs equity decreases below plan value in the 18 months after the date of the Settlement Agreement commensurate with the other unsecured creditors. On January 23, 2024, we received 2,050,982 shares of Core Scientific Inc. common stock trading under the NASDAQ symbol CORZ.\n\nHosting Agreements\n\nOn October 18, 2023, we entered into a Hosting Agreement with Joshi Petroleum, LLC (the ‚ÄúJoshi Hosting Agreement‚Äù) for rack space, network services, electrical connections, routine facility maintenance, and technical support of certain of our mining equipment. The Joshi Hosting Agreement has an initial term of three years with subsequent one year renewal periods until either party provides written notice to the other party of its desire to avoid and given renewal term at least 30 days in advance of the conclusion of the prior initial term or renewal period. As required by the Joshi Hosting Agreement, we paid a deposit of $0.1 million, and will pay an additional $0.2 million, representing the last two months of estimated service fees.\n\nOn April 4, 2023, we entered into a Master Hosting Services Agreement with Rebel Mining Company, LLC (the ‚ÄúRebel Hosting Agreement‚Äù) for rack space, network services, electrical connections, routine facility maintenance, and technical support of certain of our mining equipment. The Rebel Hosting Agreement has a term of three years with subsequent one year renewal periods. As required by the Rebel Hosting Agreement, we paid a deposit of $2.6 million representing the last two months of estimated service fees. \n\nOn February 8, 2023, we entered into a Hosting Agreement with Lancium FS 25, LLC (the ‚ÄúLancium Hosting Agreement‚Äù) for rack space, network services, electrical connections, routine facility maintenance, and technical support of certain of our mining equipment. The Lancium Hosting Agreement has a term of two years with subsequent one year renewal periods. As required by the Lancium Hosting Agreement, we paid a deposit of $0.2 million representing a partial payment towards the last two months of estimated service fees.\n\nOn June 3, 2022, we entered into a Master Agreement with Compute North LLC (the ‚ÄúCompute North MA‚Äù) for, the colocation, management, and other services of certain of our mining equipment for an initial term of five years. As of December 31, 2023, we have deposits, in the aggregate, of $0.7 million to Compute North for which during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded a $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, provision for losses on the deposit due to Compute North‚Äôs 2022 bankruptcy filing. In December 2022, the Compute North MA was assigned to GC Data Center Granbury, LLC (the ‚ÄúGC Data Center MA‚Äù) and has a term of five years from such assignment date. Under the GC Data Center MA, the monthly service fee is payable based on the actual hashrate performance of the equipment per miner type per location as a percentage of the anticipated monthly hashrate per miner type. A deposit of $0.5 million previously paid to Compute North for the last two months of monthly service fees was remitted to GC Data Center on our behalf and is included in prepaid digital hosting services at December 31, 2023.\n\n4\n\nSeries H Preferred Shares\n\nOn November 7, 2022, we entered into an agreement with Hertford Advisors Ltd. modifying the number of outstanding Series H Preferred Shares held by Hertford (the ‚ÄúModified Hertford Agreement‚Äù). Pursuant to the Modified Hertford Agreement, we cancelled 36,000 Series H Preferred Shares, with a value of $15.9 million, without payment of any cash consideration, and reduced the value of the supplier agreement intangible asset by such amount. The Modified Hertford Agreement also provides for certain resale restrictions applicable to the common shares that are issuable upon the conversion of the remaining Series H Preferred Shares during the two-year period ending on December 31, 2024, which are different from the restrictions contained in the Hertford Agreement, as well, commencing January 1, 2023 and terminating on December 31, 2023, holders of Series H Preferred Shares are permitted to (a) convert Series H Preferred Shares in an aggregate amount up to or equal to 3.0% of the aggregate number of Series H Preferred Shares outstanding on the first day of each such month and (b) sell the resulting number (and no greater number) of such converted common shares within such month. Commencing January 1, 2024 and terminating on December 31, 2024, holders of Series H Preferred Shares are permitted to (a) convert Series H Preferred Shares in an aggregate amount up to or equal to 10.0% of the aggregate number of Series H Preferred Shares outstanding on the first day of each such month and (b) sell the resulting number (and no greater number) of such converted common shares within such month. \n\nIn August 2023, we entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement (the ‚ÄúHertford Amendment‚Äù) with Hertford Advisors Ltd. and certain other parties listed in the Hertford Amendment (together, the ‚ÄúHertford Group‚Äù), which amends and restates in its entirety the purchase agreement between us and Hertford Advisors Ltd. dated July 31, 2021, as modified by the amendment to such agreement dated November 7, 2022 (together, the ‚ÄúOriginal Hertford Agreement‚Äù). As an inducement to enter into the Hertford Amendment, we issued to Hertford 1,376 Series H Preferred Shares and 800,000 warrants with an aggregate fair value of $1.0 million. \n\nIn August 2023, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the ‚ÄúPurchase Agreement‚Äù) pursuant to which we issued to two investors a total of 13,764 of our Series H Preferred Shares and a total of 1,966,293 common share purchase warrants (the ‚ÄúWarrants‚Äù), each of which entitled the holder to purchase one of our common shares (the ‚ÄúWarrant Shares‚Äù). Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we received gross proceeds of $3.0 million. We issued a total of 1,377 Series H Preferred Shares and 196,629 warrants as a finder‚Äôs fee for the transaction with an aggregate fair value of $0.5 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we will reserve for issuance the maximum aggregate number of common shares that are issuable upon exercise in full of the Warrants at any time.\n\nThe Warrants issued in connection with the Hertford Amendment and the Purchase Agreement are exercisable beginning February 12, 2024 and February 23, 2024, respectively, at an initial exercise price of $2.75 per share and have a term of three years from the date of issuance. The exercise price of the Warrants are subject to adjustment for certain stock splits, stock combinations and dilutive share issuances.\n\nThe offer and sale of the Series H Preferred Shares and the Warrants have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States in the absence of an effective registration statement or exemption from the registration requirements, and in each case in compliance with applicable state securities laws. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for distinguishing liabilities from equity, we have determined that our Series H preferred shares carry certain redemption features beyond our control. Accordingly, the Series H Preferred Shares are presented as temporary equity.\n\nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Company\n\nIn April 2021, we sponsored a special purpose acquisition company (‚ÄúSPAC‚Äù), Minority Equality Opportunities Acquisition Inc. (‚ÄúMEOA‚Äù), through our wholly owned subsidiary, Minority Equality Opportunities Acquisition Sponsor, LLC (‚ÄúSPAC Sponsor‚Äù). MEOA‚Äôs purpose is to focus initially on transactions with companies that are minority owned businesses. On July 3, 2023, MEOA announced that it did not complete an initial business combination on or prior to June 30, 2023, the deadline by which it must have completed an initial business combination. As of the close of business on July 3, 2023, MEOA‚Äôs redeemable public shares were deemed cancelled and represented only the right to receive the redemption amount. MEOA instructed Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the trustee of the trust account, to liquidate the redeemable securities held in the trust account. The redemption of MEOA‚Äôs redeemable public shares for $10.4 million was completed in the third quarter of 2023. We received no proceeds from the trust account.\n\n5\n\nOn November 30, 2022, after giving effect to the redemption of redeemable public shares of MEOA, our subsidiary owned a controlling interest of MEOA and it was consolidated. As of December 31, 2022, we held 3,162,500 shares of MEOA‚Äôs Class B common stock. The SPAC Sponsor agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its outstanding Class B common stock issued prior to MEOA‚Äôs initial public offering. On December 19, 2023, our 3,162,500 shares of MEOA‚Äôs Class B common stock were cancelled, eliminating our ownership of MEOA, and we recognized a $6.1 million gain related to the deconsolidation of MEOA.\n\nNasdaq Listing\n\nOn July 25, 2022, we received a notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (‚ÄúNasdaq‚Äù) stating that the bid price of our common shares for the last 30 consecutive trading days had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share required for continued listing under Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the ‚ÄúListing Rule‚Äù). We had a period of 180 calendar days, or until January 23, 2023, to regain compliance with the Listing Rule.\n\nOn January 24, 2023, we received notification from Nasdaq indicating that we will have an additional 180-day grace period, or until July 24, 2023, to regain compliance with the Listing Rule's $1.00 minimum bid requirement. The notification indicated that we did not regain compliance during the initial 180-day grace period provided under the Listing Rule. In accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we are eligible for the additional grace period because we meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market with the exception of the bid price requirement, and our written notice to Nasdaq of our intentions to cure the deficiency by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\n\nOn June 28, 2023, we filed Articles of Amendment to effect a share consolidation (also known as a reverse stock split) of our issued and outstanding common shares on a 1-for-7 basis. The share consolidation became effective on June 28, 2023. All share and per share amounts have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the share consolidation. On July 14, 2023, we received notification from Nasdaq indicating that we had regained compliance with the Listing Rule.\n\nService and Product\n\nOn December 28, 2023, we entered into a share purchase agreement with Joseph O‚ÄôDaniel (‚ÄúPurchaser‚Äù), a related party, under which we sold our service and product segment, including HVE ConneXions and Unified ConneXions, for $1.00 and the transfer of outstanding assets and liabilities. As a result of the share purchase agreement, the Purchaser, who served as our President, resigned effective December 28, 2023. Through December 28, 2023, the service and product segment provided network operations center (‚ÄúNOC‚Äù) services to its customers. NOC revenues were for monthly services performed for the customer that are performed either in-house or at the customer‚Äôs site. The service and product segment also delivered data management and desktop and application virtualization solutions through hybrid cloud, cloud and on premise implementations by a reseller network. We recognized a noncash gain of $0.7 million related to the transfer of net liabilities to the Purchaser.\n\nThe following Service and Product information is relevant through December 28, 2023, the date of disposal of our Service and Product segment.\n\nService\n\nCustomer service and support were key elements of our strategy and critical components of our commitment in making enterprise-class support and services available to companies of all sizes. Our technical support staff was trained to assist our customers with deployment and compatibility for any combination of virtual desktop infrastructures, hardware platforms, operating systems and backup, data interchange and storage management software. Our application engineers were trained to assist with more complex customer issues. We maintained global toll-free service and support phone lines. Additionally, we provided self-service and support through our website support portal and email.\n\nProduct\n\nOur product offerings consisted of the following disk systems: HVE Converged and Hyper-converged Infrastructure. In addition to our product offerings, we provided on-site service and installation options, round-the-clock phone access to solution experts, and proof of concept and architectural design offerings.\n\n6\n\nHVE Converged and Hyper-converged Infrastructure\n\nIn 2017, we acquired HVE, a technology provider of next generation converged and hyper-converged infrastructure dedicated to creating Manageable, Scalable, Reproducible, and Predictable (‚ÄúMSRP‚Äù) solutions based on virtualization technologies running on high-performance, next generation platforms. HVE solutions are engineered, purpose-built converged and hyper-converged virtual workspace and server solutions that support a distributed architecture, scalable with predictable performances, and come bundled with continuous active monitoring. HVE product can include support for our Desktop Cloud Orchestrator‚Ñ¢ (‚ÄúDCO‚Äù) based on customer requirements.\n\n‚Ä¢The HVE-STACK high density server provided the computer and storage appliance for the data center and was ideal for high performance computing, cloud computing and virtual desktop infrastructure (‚ÄúVDI‚Äù). The HVE 3DGFX is a VDI solution that offered hardware and software technologies to provide an appliance that could handle from eight to up to 128 high demand users in a single 2U appliance. The HVE 3DGFX was designed and engineered as a purpose-built solution based upon the MSRP engineering approach.\n\n‚Ä¢The HVE-VELOCITY High Availability Dual Enclosure storage area network (‚ÄúSAN‚Äù) provided data reliability and integrity for optimal data storage, protection and recovery. It also provided a unified network attached storage (‚ÄúNAS‚Äù) and SAN solution with thin provisioning, compression and deduplication. The 12GSAS SSD design allowed for faster access to data.\n\n‚Ä¢The HVE STAGE Server Virtualization Platform was a high-performance purpose-built server that had been optimized for server virtualization. These performance optimized servers were also compact space savers utilizing 1U of rack space. Each STAGE could be pre-configured for converged, hyper-converged or attached storage, and came with ESXi so an infrastructure is ready for virtualization.\n\n‚Ä¢The HVE VAULT backup and compute appliance was designed to handle requirements for backup and replication storage. The HVE-VAULT, with the integrated compute option, could also perform disaster recovery compute requirements with specific mission critical workloads. The HVE-VAULT could be configured as an iSCSI SAN or NAS storage device using HVE storage management software.\n\nProduction\n\nA significant number of our components and finished products were manufactured or assembled, in whole or in part, by a limited number of third parties. For certain products, we controlled the design process internally and then outsourced the manufacturing and assembly in order to achieve lower production costs.\n\nWe purchased disk drives and chassis from outside suppliers. We carefully selected suppliers based on their ability to provide quality parts and components which meet technical specifications and volume requirements.\n\nSales and Distribution\n\nOur reseller channel included systems integrators, VARs and DMRs. Our resellers may package our products as part of complete application and desktop virtualization solutions data processing systems or with other storage devices to deliver complete enterprise information technology infrastructure solutions. Our resellers also recommended our products as replacement solutions when systems were upgraded, or bundle our products with storage management software specific to the end user‚Äôs system.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nWe actively use specific hardware and software for our Bitcoin mining operations. On December 28, 2023, we sold our service and product segment and associated patents and trademarks. We do not currently own, and do not have any current plans to seek, any patents in connection with our Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nCompetitive Conditions\n\nOur business is highly competitive and operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The primary drivers of competition are demand for Bitcoin and the ability to execute miner deployments to generate the highest returns while incurring the lowest costs to mine, thereby achieving maximum efficiency.\n\n7\n\nOur competition in the Bitcoin mining space fluctuates due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the value of Bitcoin rewards for mining, the amount of network hashrate (ability to achieve awards relative to others), and the price of Bitcoin. We anticipate that over the long-term there will be a significant increase in the number of Bitcoin miners attempting to enter into, and expand, their Bitcoin mining activities as market demand recovers. Our main competitors generally include other Bitcoin mining companies, both publicly listed and private, as well as other Bitcoin miners who participate in mining pools. As more Bitcoin miners enter the mining industry, we expect additional pressure on the industry, with greater competition for access to mining rewards, competition for power and high-quality industrial scale mining infrastructure which is in limited supply.\n\nWe rely on hosting arrangements to conduct our business, and the availability of such hosting arrangements is uncertain and competitive and may be affected by changes in regulation in one or more countries. Significant competition for suitable mining data centers is expected to continue, and other government regulators, including local permitting officials, may potentially restrict the ability of potential mining data centers to begin or continue operations in certain locations.\n\nFor a more detailed description of competitive and other risks related to our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nIndustry Trends\n\nDuring 2022 and 2023, we observed several companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem experience significant challenges and initiate bankruptcy proceedings due to the significant volatility in the price of Bitcoin, the increase in interest rates, the volatility in spot prices of power, and other national and global macroeconomic factors. We anticipate this trend will likely continue as companies attempt to shift their business models to operate on significantly compressed margins. Further affecting the margins of the companies within the Bitcoin ecosystem, the Bitcoin reward for solving a block is subject to periodic incremental halving, as described in risks related to our business, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe recent shutdowns of certain digital asset exchanges and trading platforms due to fraud or business failure has negatively impacted confidence in the digital asset industry as a whole and led to increased oversight and scrutiny of the industry. We did not have any exposure to any digital asset lenders or exchanges who have declared bankruptcy or have suspended operations. We only hold and sell Bitcoin that we have mined and do not sell, hold, or redeem any Bitcoin for any other parties. Our Bitcoin is held in cold storage wallets by a well-known U.S.-based third-party digital asset-focused custodian. In addition, we sell our Bitcoin using our custodian‚Äôs U.S. brokerage services.\n\nGovernmental Regulations\n\nWe operate in a complex and rapidly evolving regulatory environment and are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal, state and local governments, governmental agencies and regulatory authorities, including the SEC, the Federal Trade Commission and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, as well as similar entities in other countries. Other regulatory bodies, governmental or semi-governmental, have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the blockchain or cryptocurrency businesses.\n\nRegulations may substantially change in the future and it is presently not possible to know how those regulations will apply to our businesses, or when they will be effective. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws and further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, which may affect our mining and other activities. For instance, various bills have been proposed in the U.S. Congress related to our business, which may be adopted and have an impact on us. Additionally, governmental agencies and regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, the Federal Trade Commission and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, may also enact further regulations related to our business, which may have an impact on us. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors‚ÄîRisks Related to Our Business.\n\nEmployees\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had five employees, three of which were full time. \n\n8\n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\nAn investment in our Company involves a high degree of risk. Each of the following risk factors in evaluating our business and prospects as well as an investment in our Company should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business and financial results could be harmed and the trading price of our common shares could decline.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nOur total revenue is substantially dependent on the prices of digital assets and volume of transactions conducted on our platform. If such price or volume declines, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\n\nWe generate the majority of our total revenue from digital mining. As such, any declines in the volume of digital asset transactions, the price of digital assets, or market liquidity for digital assets generally may result in lower total revenue. The price of digital assets and associated demand for buying, selling, and trading digital assets have historically been subject to significant volatility. The price and trading volume of any digital asset is subject to significant uncertainty and volatility, depending on a number of factors, including:\n\n‚Ä¢market conditions of, and overall sentiment towards, digital assets;\n\n‚Ä¢changes in liquidity, market-making volume, and trading activities;\n\n‚Ä¢trading activities on other digital platforms worldwide, many of which may be unregulated, and may include manipulative activities;\n\n‚Ä¢investment and trading activities of highly active retail and institutional users, speculators, miners, and investors;\n\n‚Ä¢the speed and rate at which digital assets are able to gain adoption as a medium of exchange, utility, store of value, consumptive asset, security instrument, or other financial assets worldwide, if at all;\n\n‚Ä¢decreased investor confidence in digital assets and digital platforms;\n\n‚Ä¢negative media publicity and events relating to the digital economy;\n\n‚Ä¢unpredictable social media coverage or ‚Äútrending‚Äù of, or other rumors and market speculation regarding digital assets;\n\n‚Ä¢the ability for digital assets to meet user and investor demands;\n\n‚Ä¢the functionality and utility of digital assets and their associated ecosystems and networks, including digital assets designed for use in various applications;\n\n‚Ä¢increased competition from other payment services or other digital assets that exhibit better speed, security, scalability, or other characteristics;\n\n‚Ä¢regulatory or legislative changes and updates affecting the digital economy;\n\n‚Ä¢the maintenance, troubleshooting, and development of the blockchain networks underlying digital assets, including by miners, validators, and developers worldwide;\n\n‚Ä¢the ability for digital networks to attract and retain miners or validators to secure and confirm transactions accurately and efficiently;\n\n‚Ä¢ongoing technological viability and security of digital assets and their associated smart contracts, applications and networks, including vulnerabilities against hacks and scalability;\n\n‚Ä¢fees and speed associated with processing digital asset transactions, including on the underlying blockchain networks and on digital platforms;\n\n‚Ä¢financial strength of market participants;\n\n‚Ä¢the availability and cost of funding and capital;\n\n9\n\n‚Ä¢the liquidity of digital platforms;\n\n‚Ä¢interruptions in service from or failures of major digital platforms;\n\n‚Ä¢availability of an active derivatives market for various digital assets;\n\n‚Ä¢availability of banking and payment services to support digital-related projects;\n\n‚Ä¢level of interest rates and inflation; and\n\n‚Ä¢environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns about power and water consumption.\n\nThere is no assurance that any supported digital asset will maintain its value or that there will be meaningful levels of trading activities. In the event that the price of digital assets or the demand for trading digital assets decline, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\n\nOur operating results have and will significantly fluctuate due to the highly volatile nature of digital assets.\n\nOur operating results are dependent on Bitcoin and the broader crypto economy. Due to the highly volatile nature of the crypto economy and the prices of Bitcoin, our operating results have, and will continue to, fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in accordance with market sentiments and movements in the broader crypto economy. Our operating results will continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are unpredictable and in certain instances are outside of our control, including:\n\n‚Ä¢our dependence on offerings that are dependent on crypto asset trading activity, including trading volume and the prevailing trading prices for crypto assets, whose trading prices and volume can be highly volatile;\n\n‚Ä¢adding crypto assets to, or removing from, our platform;\n\n‚Ä¢market conditions of, and overall sentiment towards, the crypto economy;\n\n‚Ä¢system failure, outages, or interruptions, including with respect to our crypto platform and third-party crypto networks; and\n\n‚Ä¢inaccessibility of our platform due to our or third-party actions.\n\nAs a result of these factors, it is challenging for us to forecast growth trends accurately and our business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate, particularly in the short term. Further, any decrease in the price of bitcoin creates a risk of increased losses or impairments. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and the crypto economy, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Quarterly and annual expenses reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. As a result, the trading price of our common shares may increase or decrease significantly.\n\nThe recent disruption in the crypto asset markets may harm our reputation.\n\nDue to the recent disruption in the crypto asset markets, our customers, suppliers and other business partners may deem our business to be risky and lose confidence to enter into business transactions with us on terms that we deem acceptable. For example, our suppliers may require higher deposits or advance payments from us. In addition, new regulations may subject us to investigation, administrative or regulatory proceedings, and civil or criminal litigation, all of which could harm our reputation and negatively affect our business operation and the value of our common shares. As of the date of this annual report, we do not believe that our operations or financial conditions associated have been materially impacted by any reputational harm that we may face in light of the recent disruption in the crypto asset markets. However, there is no guarantee that such disruption or any reputational harm resulting therefrom will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.\n\n10\n\nThe future development and growth of crypto is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to predict and evaluate. If digital assets do not grow as we expect, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nDigital assets built on blockchain technology were only introduced in 2008. Digital assets are designed for different purposes. Bitcoin, for instance, was designed to serve as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, while Ethereum was designed to be a smart contract and decentralized application platform. Many other crypto networks, ranging from cloud computing to tokenized securities networks, have only recently been established. The further growth and development of any crypto assets and their underlying networks and other cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the creation, transfer, and usage of crypto assets represent a new and evolving paradigm that is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, including:\n\n‚Ä¢many crypto networks have limited operating histories, have not been validated in production, and are still in the process of developing and making significant decisions that will affect the design, supply, issuance, functionality, and governance of their respective crypto assets and underlying blockchain networks, any of which could adversely affect their respective crypto assets;\n\n‚Ä¢many crypto networks are in the process of implementing software upgrades and other changes to their protocols, which could introduce bugs, security risks, or adversely affect the respective crypto networks;\n\n‚Ä¢security issues, bugs, and software errors have been identified with many digital assets and their underlying blockchain networks, some of which have been exploited by malicious actors. There are also inherent security weaknesses in some digital assets, such as when creators of certain crypto networks use procedures that could allow hackers to counterfeit tokens. Any weaknesses identified with a digital asset could adversely affect its price, security, liquidity, and adoption. If a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers) obtains a majority of the compute or staking power on a crypto network, as has happened in the past, it may be able to manipulate transactions, which could cause financial losses to holders, damage the network‚Äôs reputation and security, and adversely affect its value;\n\n‚Ä¢if rewards and transaction fees for miners or validators on any particular crypto network are not sufficiently high to attract and retain miners, a crypto network‚Äôs security and speed may be adversely affected, increasing the likelihood of a malicious attack;\n\n‚Ä¢algonomic units to U.S. dollar may fail causing devaluation in specific cryptocurrencies which may impact the market perception of safer currencies; and\n\n‚Ä¢many crypto networks are in the early stages of developing partnerships and collaborations, all of which may not succeed and adversely affect the usability and adoption of the respective crypto assets.\n\nVarious other technical issues have also been uncovered from time to time that resulted in disabled functionalities, exposure of certain users‚Äô personal information, theft of users‚Äô assets, and other negative consequences, and which required resolution with the attention and efforts of their global miner, user, and development communities. If any such risks or other risks materialize, and in particular if they are not resolved, the development and growth of crypto may be significantly affected and, as a result, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nCryptocurrency mining activities are energy-intensive, which may restrict the geographic locations of mining machines. Government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations, such as ours.\n\nMining cryptocurrency requires large amounts of electrical power, and electricity costs are expected to account for a significant portion of our overall costs. The availability and cost of electricity will restrict the geographic locations of our mining activities. Any shortage of electricity supply or increase in electricity costs in any location where we plan to operate may negatively impact the viability and the expected economic return for cryptocurrency mining activities in that location.\n\n11\n\nFurther, our business model can only be successful and our mining operations can only be profitable if the costs, including electrical power costs, associated with cryptocurrency mining are lower than the price of the cryptocurrency itself. As a result, any equipment we deploy can only be successful if we can obtain access to sufficient electrical power on a cost-effective basis through hosting arrangements with mining data centers. Our deployment of new mining equipment requires us to find sites where that is the case. Even if our electrical power costs do not increase, significant fluctuations in, and any prolonged periods of, low cryptocurrency prices may also cause our electrical supply to no longer be cost-effective.\n\nFurthermore, if cryptocurrency mining becomes more widespread, government scrutiny related to restrictions on cryptocurrency mining facilities and their energy consumption may significantly increase. The consumption of electricity could lead to governmental measures restricting or prohibiting the use of electricity for cryptocurrency mining activities. Any such development in the jurisdictions where we plan to operate could increase our compliance burdens and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nConcerns about greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change may result in environmental taxes, charges, assessments, penalties or litigation, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe effects of human activity on global climate change have attracted considerable public and scientific attention, as well as the attention of the United States and other governments. Efforts are being made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly those from coal combustion power plants, some of which plants our hosting facility suppliers may rely upon for power. The added cost of any environmental taxes, charges, assessments or penalties levied on such power plants, or the cost of litigation filed against such power plants, could be passed on to us, increasing the cost to provide hosting services to its customers. Any enactment of laws or promulgation of regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions by the United States, or any domestic or foreign jurisdiction in which we conduct business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, as a result of negative publicity regarding environmental concerns associated with Bitcoin mining, some companies have ceased accepting Bitcoin for certain types of purchases, and additional companies may do so in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nWe rely on hosting arrangements to conduct our business, and the availability of such hosting arrangements is uncertain and competitive and may be affected by changes in regulation in one or more countries.\n\nIf we are unable to successfully enter into definitive hosting agreements with mining data centers on favorable terms or those counterparties fail to perform their obligations under such agreements, we may be forced to look for alternative mining data centers to host its mining equipment.\n\nSignificant competition for suitable mining data centers is expected to continue, and other government regulators, including local permitting officials, may potentially restrict the ability of potential mining data centers to begin or continue operations in certain locations. They can also restrict the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations in times of electricity shortage, or may otherwise potentially restrict or prohibit the provision of electricity to mining operations.\n\nWe face risks of downtime at hosting sites due to excessive weather or heat, which could have an adverse effect on the mining of cryptocurrency and impact our revenues.\n\nA disruption at hosting sites may affect the mining of cryptocurrency. Generally, cryptocurrency and our business of mining cryptocurrency is dependent upon consistent operations at hosting sites. A significant disruption in a hosting site's ability to function due to adverse weather could disrupt mining operations until the disruption is resolved and have an adverse effect on our ability to mine cryptocurrencies, impacting our revenues.\n\nWe may be affected by price fluctuations in the wholesale and retail power markets.\n\nMarket prices for power, generation capacity and ancillary services, are unpredictable. Depending upon the effectiveness of any price risk management activity undertaken by us, including but not limited to attempts to secure hosting services contracts at fixed fees, an increase in market prices for power, generation capacity, and ancillary services may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. Long- and short-term power prices may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n\n‚Ä¢increases and decreases in generation capacity;\n\n12\n\n‚Ä¢changes in power transmission or fuel transportation capacity constraints or inefficiencies;\n\n‚Ä¢demand response/mandatory curtailments;\n\n‚Ä¢volatile weather conditions, particularly unusually hot or mild summers or unusually cold or warm winters;\n\n‚Ä¢technological shifts resulting in changes in the demand for power or in patterns of power usage, including the potential development of demand-side management tools, expansion and technological advancements in power storage capability and the development of new fuels or new technologies for the production or storage of power;\n\n‚Ä¢federal and state power, market and environmental regulation and legislation; and\n\n‚Ä¢changes in capacity prices and capacity markets.\n\nIf we are unable to secure consistent power supply at prices or on terms acceptable to it, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\n\nAs cryptocurrencies may be determined to be investment securities, we may inadvertently violate the Investment Company Act of 1940 and incur large losses as a result and potentially be required to register as an investment company or terminate operations and we may incur third-party liabilities.\n\nWe believe that we are not engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and we do not hold ourself out as being engaged in those activities. However, under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ‚ÄúInvestment Company Act‚Äù), a company may be deemed an investment company under section 3(a)(1)(C) thereof if the value of its investment securities is more than 40% of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.\n\nAs a result of our investments and our mining activities, the investment securities we hold could exceed 40% of our total assets, exclusive of cash items and, accordingly, we could determine that we have become an inadvertent investment company. The cryptocurrency that we own, acquire or mine may be deemed an investment security by the SEC, and although we do not believe any of the cryptocurrency we own, acquire or mine are securities, any determination we make regarding whether crypto assets are securities is a risk-based assessment, not a legal standard binding on a regulatory body or court, and does not preclude legal or regulatory action. An inadvertent investment company can avoid being classified as an investment company if it can rely on one of the exclusions under the Investment Company Act. One such exclusion, Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act, allows an inadvertent investment company a grace period of one year from the earlier of (a) the date on which an issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of the issuer‚Äôs total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis and (b) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer‚Äôs total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, we do not believe we are an inadvertent investment company. We may take actions to cause the investment securities held by us to be less than 40% of our total assets, which may include acquiring assets with our cash and cryptocurrency on hand or liquidating our investment securities or cryptocurrency or seeking a no-action letter from the SEC if we are unable to acquire sufficient assets or liquidate sufficient investment securities in a timely manner.\n\nAs the Rule 3a-2 exception is available to a company no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusion were available to us, we would have to keep within the 40% limit for at least three years after we cease being an inadvertent investment company. This may limit our ability to make certain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on our earnings. In any event, we do not intend to become an investment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities.\n\nClassification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act requires registration with the SEC. If an investment company fails to register, it would have to stop doing almost all business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time consuming and restrictive and would require a restructuring of our operations, and we would be very constrained in the kind of business we could do as a registered investment company. Further, we would become subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio composition, and would need to file reports under the Investment Company Act regime. The cost of such compliance would result in us incurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to register if required would have a materially adverse impact to conduct our operations.\n\n13\n\nIf regulatory changes or interpretations of our activities require its registration as a money services business under the regulations promulgated by The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, we may be required to register and comply with such regulations. If regulatory changes or interpretations of our activities require the licensing or other registration of us as a money transmitter (or equivalent designation) under state law in any state in which we operate, we may be required to seek licensure or otherwise register and comply with such state law. In the event of any such requirement, to the extent we decide to continue, the required registrations, licensure and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses to us. We may also decide to cease its operations. Any termination of certain operations in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to investors.\n\nTo the extent that our activities cause us to be deemed a money service business under the regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Treasury Department (‚ÄúFinCEN‚Äù) under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, we may be required to comply with FinCEN regulations, including those that would mandate us to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records.\n\nTo the extent that our activities cause us to be deemed a money transmitter or equivalent designation under state law in any state in which we operate, we may be required to seek a license or otherwise register with a state regulator and comply with state regulations that may include the implementation of anti-money laundering programs, maintenance of certain records and other operational requirements. Currently, the New York Department of Financial Services has finalized its ‚ÄúBitLicense‚Äù framework for businesses that conduct ‚Äúvirtual currency business activity.‚Äù We will continue to monitor for developments in New York legislation, guidance, and regulations.\n\nSuch additional federal or state regulatory obligations may cause us to incur extraordinary expenses, possibly affecting our business in a material and adverse manner. Furthermore, we and our service providers may not be capable of complying with certain federal or state regulatory obligations applicable to money service businesses and money transmitters. If we are deemed to be subject to and determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may act to dissolve and liquidate us. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in us.\n\nRegulatory changes or actions in one or more countries or jurisdictions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, in a manner that adversely affects our business, prospects or operations.\n\nAs cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently, with certain governments deeming cryptocurrencies illegal, and others allowing their use and trade without restriction. In some jurisdictions, such as in the United States, digital assets, like cryptocurrencies, are subject to extensive regulatory requirements.\n\nCryptocurrency is viewed differently by different regulatory and standards setting organizations globally as well as in the United States on the federal and state levels. For example, the Financial Action Task Force (‚ÄúFATF‚Äù) and the Internal Revenue Service (‚ÄúIRS‚Äù) consider a cryptocurrency as currency or an asset or property. Further, the IRS applies general tax principles that apply to property transactions to transactions involving virtual currency.\n\nIf regulatory changes or interpretations require the regulation of cryptocurrency under the securities laws of the United States or elsewhere, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act or similar laws of other jurisdictions and interpretations by the SEC, the CFTC, the IRS, Department of Treasury or other agencies or authorities, we may be required to register and comply with such regulations, including at a state or local level. To the extent that we decide to continue operations, the required registrations and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary expense or burdens to us. We may also decide to cease certain operations and change our business model. Any disruption of our operations in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to us.\n\nCurrent and future legislation and SEC rule making and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which cryptocurrencies are viewed or treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, cryptocurrencies may not be excluded from the definition of ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù by SEC rule making or interpretation requiring registration of all transactions unless another exemption is available, including transacting in cryptocurrency among owners and require registration of trading platforms as ‚Äúexchanges‚Äù.\n\n14\n\nDue to concerns around resource consumption and associated environmental concerns, particularly as such concerns relate to public utilities companies, various countries, states and cities have implemented, or are considering implementing, moratoriums on Bitcoin mining in their jurisdictions. Such moratoriums would impede Bitcoin mining and/or Bitcoin use more broadly. For example, in November 2022, New York imposed a two-year moratorium on new proof-of-work mining permits at fossil fuel plants in the state. It is possible that other states may likewise create laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of cryptocurrencies under the law. If we fail to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations or be subjected to fines, penalties and other governmental action. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue its business model at all, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we plan to hold or expect to acquire for our own account.\n\nOur business is dependent on a small number of digital asset mining equipment suppliers.\n\nOur business is dependent upon digital asset mining equipment suppliers providing an adequate supply of new generation digital asset mining machines at economical prices to customers intending to purchase our hosting and other solutions. The growth in our business is directly related to increased demand for hosting services and cryptocurrency which is dependent in large part on the availability of new generation mining machines offered for sale at a price conducive to profitable digital asset mining, as well as the trading price of cryptocurrency. The market price and availability of new mining machines fluctuates with the price of cryptocurrencies and can be volatile. In addition, as more companies seek to enter the mining industry, the demand for machines may outpace supply and create mining machine equipment shortages. There are no assurances that cryptocurrency mining equipment suppliers will be able to keep pace with any surge in demand for mining equipment. Further, manufacturing mining machine purchase contracts are not favorable to purchasers and we may have little or no recourse in the event a mining machine manufacturer defaults on its mining machine delivery commitments. If we and our customers are not able to obtain a sufficient number of digital asset mining machines at favorable prices, our growth expectations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will be negatively impacted.\n\nMining machines rely on components and raw materials that may be subject to price fluctuations or shortages, including ASIC chips that have been subject to a significant shortage.\n\nIn order to build and sustain our self-mining operations we will depend on third parties to provide us with ASIC chips and other critical components for our mining equipment, which may be subject to price fluctuations or shortages. For example, the ASIC chip is the key component of a mining machine as it determines the efficiency of the device. The production of ASIC chips typically requires highly sophisticated silicon wafers, which currently only a small number of fabrication facilities, or wafer foundries, in the world are capable of producing. We believe that the previous microchip shortage that the entire industry experienced lead to price fluctuations and disruption in the supply of key miner components. Specifically, the ASIC chips have recently been subject to a significant price increases and shortages.\n\nThere is also a risk that a manufacturer or seller of ASIC chips or other necessary mining equipment may adjust the prices according cryptocurrency prices or otherwise, so the cost of new machines could become unpredictable and extremely high. As a result, at times, we may be forced to obtain mining machines and other hardware at premium prices, to the extent they are even available. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n15\n\nBanks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in cryptocurrency-related activities or that accept cryptocurrencyas payment, including financial institutions of investors in our common shares.\n\nA number of companies that engage in cryptocurrency-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with cryptocurrencies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions in response to government action. We also may be unable to obtain or maintain these services for our business. The difficulty that many businesses that provide cryptocurrency-related activities have and may continue to have in finding banks and financial institutions willing to provide them services may be decreasing the usefulness of cryptocurrency as a payment system and harming public perception of cryptocurrency, and could decrease their usefulness and harm their public perception in the future.\n\nThe impact of geopolitical and economic events on the supply and demand for cryptocurrencyis uncertain.\n\nGeopolitical crises may motivate large-scale purchases of cryptocurrencies, which could increase the price of cryptocurrencies rapidly. This may increase the likelihood of a subsequent price decrease as crisis-driven purchasing behavior dissipates, adversely affecting the value of our inventory following such downward adjustment. Such risks are similar to the risks of purchasing commodities in uncertain times, such as the risk of purchasing, holding or selling gold. Alternatively, as an emerging asset class with limited acceptance as a payment system or commodity, global crises and general economic downturns may discourage investment in cryptocurrency as investors focus their investment on less volatile asset classes as a means of hedging their investment risk.\n\nAs an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, cryptocurrency, which is relatively new, is subject to supply and demand forces. How such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events is largely uncertain but could be harmful to us. Political or economic crises may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of cryptocurrency either globally or locally. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrency that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\n\nWe may not be able to compete with other companies, some of whom have greater resources and experience.\n\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against present or future competitors. We do not have the resources to compete with larger providers of similar services at this time. The cryptocurrency industry has attracted various high-profile and well-established operators, some of which have substantially greater liquidity and financial resources than we do. With the limited resources we have available, we may experience great difficulties in expanding and improving our network of computers to remain competitive. Competition from existing and future competitors, particularly those that have access to competitively-priced energy, could result in our inability to secure acquisitions and partnerships that we may need to expand our business in the future. This competition from other entities with greater resources, experience and reputations may result in our failure to maintain or expand our business, as we may never be able to successfully execute our business plan. If we are unable to expand and remain competitive, our business could be negatively affected.\n\nThe mining data centers at which we maintain our mining equipment may experience damages, including damages that are not covered by insurance.\n\nThe mining data centers at which we maintain our mining equipment are, and any future mining data centers at which we maintain our mining equipment will be, subject to a variety of risks relating to physical condition and operation, including:\n\n‚Ä¢the presence of construction or repair defects or other structural or building damage;\n\n‚Ä¢any non-compliance with or liabilities under applicable environmental, health or safety regulations or requirements or building permit requirements;\n\n‚Ä¢any damage resulting from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and windstorms; and\n\n‚Ä¢claims by employees and others for injuries sustained at our properties.\n\n16\n\nFor example, the mining data centers at which we maintain our mining equipment could be rendered inoperable, temporarily or permanently, as a result of a fire or other natural disaster or by a terrorist or other attack on the facilities where our mining equipment is located. Although we have multiple sites in an effort to mitigate this risk, these and other measures we take to protect against these risks may not be sufficient. Any property insurance we obtain in the future may not be adequate to cover any losses we suffer as a result of any of these events. In the event of an uninsured loss, including a loss in excess of insured limits, at any of the mining data centers at which we maintain our mining equipment, such mining data centers may not be adequately repaired in a timely manner or at all and we may lose some or all of the future revenues anticipated to be derived from our equipment located at such mining data centers.\n\nThe dynamic nature of digital asset exchanges which Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are traded on may cause disruptions in the crypto asset markets, which may expose us to the effects of negative publicity resulting from fraudulent actors in the cryptocurrency space, and can adversely affect an investment in us.\n\nThe digital asset exchanges on which Bitcoin is traded are relatively new. Many digital asset exchanges do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices, or regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, such digital asset exchanges, including prominent exchanges handling a significant portion of the volume of digital asset trading. In the recent past, a number of companies in the crypto industry declared bankruptcy. Such bankruptcies have contributed, at least in part, to further price volatility in most crypto assets, a loss of confidence in the participants of the digital asset ecosystem and negative publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly, and other participants and entities in the digital asset industry have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected. These events have also negatively impacted the demand for the digital assets markets. As a result of these events, many digital asset markets, including the market for Bitcoin, have experienced increased price volatility. The Bitcoin ecosystem may continue to be negatively impacted and experience long term volatility if public confidence decreases. Further, we have been directly and indirectly impacted by certain of the recent bankruptcies in the crypto asset space, and may in the future be directly or indirectly impacted by any future bankruptcies in the crypto asset space. \n\nThese events are continuing to develop and it is not possible to predict, at this time, every risk that they may pose to us, our service providers, or the digital asset industry as a whole. A perceived lack of stability in the digital asset exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of digital asset exchanges due to business failure, hackers or malware, government-mandated regulation, or fraud, may reduce confidence in digital asset networks and result in greater volatility in cryptocurrency values. These potential consequences of a digital asset exchange‚Äôs failure could adversely affect an investment in us.\n\nIt may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell, or use cryptocurrencies, participate in blockchains or utilize similar cryptocurrency assets in one or more countries, the ruling of which would adversely affect us.\n\nAs cryptocurrency has grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrency; certain governments have deemed them illegal, and others have allowed their use and trade without restriction, while in some jurisdictions, such as in the United.States, subject to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements. Until recently, little, or no regulatory attention has been directed toward cryptocurrency by U.S. federal and state governments, foreign governments and self-regulatory agencies. As cryptocurrency has grown in popularity and in market size, the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress, and certain U.S. agencies have begun to examine cryptocurrency in more detail.\n\nOne or more countries, including but not limited to China and Russia, which have taken harsh regulatory action in the past, may take regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell, or use these cryptocurrency assets or to exchange for fiat currency. In many nations, particularly in China and Russia, it is illegal to accept payment in cryptocurrencies for consumer transactions and banking institutions are barred from accepting deposits of cryptocurrency. Such restrictions may adversely affect us as the large-scale use of cryptocurrency as a means of exchange is presently confined to certain regions globally. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrency that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\n\n17\n\nInvestors may not have the same protections that exist for traditional stock exchanges.\n\nTraditional stock exchanges have listing requirements and vet issuers, requiring them to be subjected to rigorous listing standards and rules, and monitor investors transacting on such platform for fraud and other improprieties. Depending on a ledger-based platform‚Äôs controls and the other policies of the ledger-based platform on which a given cryptocurrency trades, such cryptocurrency may not benefit from the protections afforded to traditional stock exchanges. For ledger-based platforms that do not provide sufficient protections, there is a risk of fraud and manipulation. These factors may decrease liquidity or volume of a given ledger-based platform or of the cryptocurrency industry in general or may otherwise increase volatility of investment securities or other assets trading on a ledger-based system. Such potential decreased liquidity or volume, or increase in volatility may adversely affect us, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrency that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account and harm investors.\n\nOur operations, investment strategies and profitability may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in cryptocurrency.\n\nWe compete with other users and/or companies that are mining cryptocurrency and other potential financial vehicles, including securities backed by or linked to cryptocurrency through entities similar to us. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond our control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles, or to invest in cryptocurrency directly. The emergence of other financial vehicles and exchange-traded funds have been scrutinized by regulators and such scrutiny and the negative impressions or conclusions resulting from such scrutiny could be applicable to us and impact our ability to successfully pursue our strategy or operate at all, or to establish or maintain a public market for our securities. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrency that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\n\nCryptocurrencymay be subject to loss, theft, or restriction on access.\n\nThere is a risk that some or all of any cryptocurrency that we own could be lost or stolen. Cryptocurrencies are stored in cryptocurrency sites commonly referred to as ‚Äúwallets‚Äù by holders of cryptocurrencies which may be accessed to exchange a holder‚Äôs cryptocurrency assets. Access to our cryptocurrency assets could also be restricted by cybercrime (such as a denial of service attack) against a service at which we maintain a hosted hot wallet. A hot wallet refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the Internet. Generally, hot wallets are easier to set up and access than wallets in cold storage, but they are also more susceptible to hackers and other technical vulnerabilities. Cold storage refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the Internet. Cold storage is generally more secure than hot storage, but is not ideal for quick or regular transactions and we may experience lag time in our ability to respond to market fluctuations in the price of our cryptocurrency assets. We expect to hold all our cryptocurrency in a combination of insured institutional custody services and multi signature cold storage wallets, and maintain secure backups to reduce the risk of malfeasance, but the risk of loss of our cryptocurrency assets cannot be wholly eliminated. Any restrictions on access to our hot wallet accounts due to cybercrime or other reasons could limit our ability to convert cryptocurrency to cash, potentially resulting in liquidity issues.\n\nHackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure cryptocurrency. As we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks, or other security threats. Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and, consequently, our investments and profitability. The loss or destruction of a private key required to access our digital wallets may be irreversible and we may be denied access for all time to our cryptocurrency holdings or the holdings of others held in those compromised wallets. Our loss of access to our private keys or a data loss relating to our digital wallets could adversely affect our investments and assets.\n\nCryptocurrencies are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in which they are held, which wallet‚Äôs public key or address is reflected in the network‚Äôs public blockchain. To the extent such private keys are lost, destroyed, or otherwise compromised, we will be unable to access our cryptocurrency rewards and such private keys may not be capable of being restored by any network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our cryptocurrency could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrency that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\n\n18\n\nIncorrect or fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions may be irreversible.\n\nCryptocurrency transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed or fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions could adversely affect our investments and assets. Cryptocurrency transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the cryptocurrencies from the transaction. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to a blockchain, an incorrect transfer of a cryptocurrency or a theft thereof generally will not be reversible and we may not have sufficient recourse to recover our losses from any such transfer or theft. It is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, our cryptocurrency rewards could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled accounts. Further, at this time, there is no specifically enumerated U.S. or foreign governmental, regulatory, investigative or prosecutorial authority or mechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen cryptocurrency. In the event of a loss, we would be reliant on existing private investigative entities to investigate any such loss of our cryptocurrency assets. To the extent that we are unable to recover our losses from such action, error or theft, such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations of and potentially the value of any cryptocurrency that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\n\nOur interactions with a blockchain may expose us to specially designated nationals or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate distributed ledger technology.\n\nThe Office of Financial Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury (‚ÄúOFAC‚Äù) requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with persons named on its specially designated nationals list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions, we may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC‚Äôs specially designated nationals list. Our policy prohibits any transactions with such specially designated national individuals, but we may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual with whom we transact with respect to selling cryptocurrency assets. Moreover, federal law prohibits any U.S. person from knowingly or unknowingly possessing any visual depiction commonly known as child pornography. Recent media reports have suggested that persons have embedded such depictions on one or more blockchains. Because our business requires us to download and retain one or more blockchains to effectuate our ongoing business, it is possible that such digital ledgers contain prohibited depictions without our knowledge or consent. To the extent government enforcement authorities literally enforce these and other laws and regulations that are impacted by decentralized distributed ledger technology, we may be subject to investigation, administrative or court proceedings, and monetary fines and penalties, which could harm our reputation.\n\nThe price of cryptocurrency may be affected by the sale of cryptocurrency by other vehicles investing in cryptocurrency or tracking cryptocurrency markets.\n\nThe mathematical protocols under which many cryptocurrencies are mined permit the creation of a limited, predetermined amount of currency, while others have no limit established on total supply. To the extent that other vehicles investing in cryptocurrency or tracking cryptocurrency markets form and come to represent a significant proportion of the demand for a cryptocurrency, large redemptions of the securities of those vehicles and the subsequent sale of such cryptocurrency by such vehicles could negatively affect the price and value of the cryptocurrency inventory we hold. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrency that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\n\nBitcoin is subject to halving, and our Bitcoin mining operations may generate less revenue as a result.\n\nAt mathematically predetermined intervals, the number of new Bitcoin awarded for solving a block is cut in half, which is referred to as ‚Äúhalving‚Äù. The next halving for the Bitcoin blockchain is currently anticipated to occur in April 2024, at which time the block rewards for Bitcoin will halve from 6.25 to 3.125. While Bitcoin prices have historically increased around these halving events, there is no guarantee that the price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining rewards. If a corresponding and proportionate increase in the price of Bitcoin does not follow the upcoming or future halving events, the revenue we earn from our Bitcoin mining operations would see a decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n19\n\nThere are risks related to technological obsolescence, the vulnerability of the global supply chain to cryptocurrencyhardware disruption, and difficulty in obtaining new hardware which may have a negative effect on our business.\n\nOur mining operations can only be successful and ultimately profitable if the costs of mining cryptocurrency, including hardware and electricity costs, associated with mining cryptocurrency are lower than the price of cryptocurrency. As our mining facility operates, our miners experience ordinary wear and tear, and may also face more significant malfunctions caused by a number of extraneous factors beyond our control. The physical degradation of our miners will require us to, over time, replace those miners which are no longer functional. Additionally, as the technology evolves, we may be required to acquire newer models of miners to remain competitive in the market.\n\nAlso, because we expect to depreciate all new miners, our reported operating results will be negatively affected. Further, the global supply chain for cryptocurrency miners is presently heavily dependent on China. Should disruptions to the China-based global supply chain for cryptocurrency hardware occur, we may not be able to obtain adequate replacement parts for existing miners or to obtain additional miners from the manufacturer on a timely basis. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to pursue our new strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe may not adequately respond to price fluctuations and rapidly changing technology, which may negatively affect our business.\n\nCompetitive conditions within the cryptocurrency industry require that we use sophisticated technology in the operation of our business. The industry for blockchain technology is characterized by rapid technological changes, new product introductions, enhancements, and evolving industry standards. New technologies, techniques or products could emerge that might offer better performance than the software and other technologies we currently utilize, and we may have to manage transitions to these new technologies to remain competitive. We may not be successful, generally or relative to our competitors in the cryptocurrency industry, in timely implementing new technology into our systems, or doing so in a cost-effective manner. As a result, our business and operations may suffer.\n\nThe reward for mining cryptocurrency in the future may decrease, and the value of cryptocurrency may not adjust to compensate us for the reduction in the rewards we receive from our mining efforts.\n\nThere is no guarantee that price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies will compensate for the reduction in mining reward. If a corresponding and proportionate increase in the trading price of a cryptocurrency or a proportionate decrease in mining difficulty does not follow the decrease in rewards, the revenue we earn from our cryptocurrency mining operations could see a corresponding decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\n\nThe value of cryptocurrencymay be subject to pricing risk and has historically been subject to wide swings.\n\nCryptocurrency market prices, which have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety of factors (including those discussed below), are determined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets, and derivative platforms. Furthermore, such prices may be subject to factors such as those that impact commodities, more so than business activities, which could be subjected to additional influence from fraudulent or illegitimate actors, real or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory, or other conditions. Pricing may be the result of, and may continue to result in, speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of cryptocurrencies, inflating and making its market prices more volatile or creating ‚Äúbubble‚Äù type risks for cryptocurrencies.\n\n20\n\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of forks. Forks in a digital asset network may occur in the future which may affect the value of cryptocurrencyheld by us.\n\nTo the extent that a significant majority of users and miners on a cryptocurrency network install software that changes the cryptocurrency network or properties of a cryptocurrency, including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new cryptocurrency, the cryptocurrency network would be subject to new protocols and software. However, if less than a significant majority of users and miners on the cryptocurrency network consent to the proposed modification, and the modification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, the consequence would be what is known as a ‚Äúfork‚Äù of the network, with one prong running the pre-modified software and the other running the modified software. The effect of such a fork would be the existence of two versions of the cryptocurrency running in parallel, yet lacking interchangeability and necessitating exchange-type transactions to convert currencies between the two forks. A fork in a cryptocurrency could adversely affect our business.\n\nWe may not be able to realize the economic benefit of a fork, either immediately or ever, which could adversely affect our business. If we hold a cryptocurrency at the time of a hard fork into two cryptocurrencies, industry standards would dictate that we would be expected to hold an equivalent amount of the old and new assets following the fork. However, we may not be able, or it may not be practical, to secure or realize the economic benefit of the new asset for various reasons. Additionally, laws, regulations or other factors may prevent us from benefiting from the new asset.\n\nIf a malicious actor or botnet obtains control in excess of 50% of the processing power active on any cryptocurrency network, it is possible that such actor or botnet could manipulate the blockchain in a manner that adversely affects an investment in us.\n\nIf a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers) obtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to mining on any digital asset network it may be able to alter the blockchain by constructing alternate blocks if it is able to solve for such blocks faster than the remainder of the miners on the blockchain can add valid blocks. In such alternate blocks, the malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude, or modify the ordering of transactions, though it could not generate new digital assets or transactions using such control. Using alternate blocks, the malicious actor could ‚Äúdouble-spend‚Äù its own digital assets (i.e., spend the same digital assets in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other users‚Äô transactions for so long as it maintains control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet does not yield its majority control of the processing power or the digital asset community does not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to the blockchain may not be possible. Such changes could adversely affect an investment in us.\n\nThe approach towards and possible crossing of the 50% threshold indicate a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of digital asset transactions. To the extent that the digital assets ecosystems do not act to ensure greater decentralization of digital asset mining processing power, the feasibility of a malicious actor obtaining more than 50% of the processing power on any digital asset network (e.g., through control of a large mining pool or through hacking such a mining pool) will increase, which may adversely impact an investment in us.\n\nCryptocurrencies, including those maintained by or for us, may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and hacks.\n\nAs with any computer code generally, flaws in cryptocurrency codes may be exposed by malicious actors. Several errors and defects have been found previously, including those that disabled some functionality for users and exposed users‚Äô information. Exploitation of flaws in the source code that allow malicious actors to take or create money have previously occurred. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, our devices, as well as our miners, computer systems and those of third parties that we use in our operations, are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including cyberattacks such as viruses and worms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or misuse, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our miners and computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations. Such events could have a material adverse effect our business, prospects, or operations and potentially the value of any Bitcoin that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\n\n21\n\nMalicious cyber-attacks, attempted cybersecurity breaches, and other adverse events affecting our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses and cause losses.\n\nDespite defensive measures we have taken to protect, detect, respond and recover from cyber threats, we experience cybersecurity threats and incidents from time to time, and it is possible that such defensive measures will be unsuccessful in mitigating a cybersecurity event. These events may arise from external factors such as governments, organized crime, hackers, and other third parties such as infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom we have granted access to our computer systems. If our security measures are breached, our business would suffer and we could incur material liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.\n\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure or capacity constraints of any of the third-party service providers that facilitate our business activities. In addition, the increased flexibility for our employees to work remotely post-Pandemic has amplified certain risks related to, among other things, the increased demand on our information technology resources and systems, the increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and the increased number of points of possible attack, such as laptops and mobile devices (both of which are now being used in increased numbers), to be secured.\n\nOur remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyber-attack. If an actual, threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed. We may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage, pay a ransom, protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches.\n\nOur cash and other sources of liquidity may not be sufficient to fund our operations and there is substantial doubt about the Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date of issuance of the financial statements and we may not be successful in raising additional capital necessary to meet expected increases in working capital needs and if we raise additional funding through sales of equity or equity-based securities, your shares will be diluted.\n\nManagement has projected that based on our hashing rate at December 31, 2023, cash on hand may not be sufficient to allow the Company to continue operations and there is substantial doubt about the Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date of issuance of the financial statements if we are unable to raise additional funding for operations. We expect our working capital needs to increase in the future as we continue to expand and enhance our operations. Our ability to raise additional funds for working capital through equity or debt financings or other sources may depend on the financial success of our then current business and successful implementation of our key strategic initiatives, financial, economic and market conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Further equity financings may have a dilutive effect on shareholders and any debt financing, if available, may require restrictions to be placed on our future financing and operating activities. If we require additional capital and are unsuccessful in raising that capital at a reasonable cost and at the required times, or at all, we may not be able to continue our business operations in the cryptocurrency mining industry or we may be unable to advance our growth initiatives, either of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nSignificant changes from our current forecasts, including but not limited to: (i) shortfalls from projected mining earning levels; (ii) increases in operating costs; (iii) fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrency; and (iv) inability to maintain compliance with the requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market and/or inability to maintain listing with the NASDAQ Capital Market could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access the level of funding necessary to continue our operations at current levels. If any of these events occurs or we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or financing sources, we may be forced to liquidate assets where possible and/or curtail, suspend or cease planned programs or operations generally or seek bankruptcy protection or be subject to an involuntary bankruptcy petition, any of, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\n\nThese factors, among others, indicate there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date of issuance of the financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction \n\n22\n\nof liabilities in the normal course of business and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If our business ceases to continue as a going concern due to lack of available capital or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. See ‚ÄúItem 7. Management‚Äôs discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations‚Äù.\n\nWe have a history of net losses. We may not achieve or maintain profitability.\n\nWe have limited non-recurring revenues derived from operations. We have a history of net losses, and we expect to continue to incur net losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability. We may see continued losses during 2024 and as a result of these and other factors, we may not be able to achieve, sustain or increase profitability in the near future. \n\nWe are subject to many risks common to early-stage enterprises, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial, and other resources, technology, and market acceptance issues. There is no assurance that we will be successful in achieving a return on shareholders‚Äô investment and the likelihood of success must be considered considering our stage of operations. \n\nThe failure to attract, hire, retain and motivate key personnel could have a significant adverse impact on our operations. \n\nOur success depends on the retention and maintenance of key personnel, including members of senior management. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including competition for such highly skilled personnel; fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions; changes in our management or leadership; competitors‚Äô hiring practices; and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. The loss of any of these key persons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nOur success is also dependent on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train, motivate and retain highly qualified management and finance personnel. Any such new hire may require a significant transition period prior to making a meaningful contribution. Competition for qualified employees is particularly intense in the technology industry, and we have in the past experienced difficulty recruiting qualified employees. Our failure to attract and to retain the necessary qualified personnel could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition. Competition for such personnel can be intense, and no assurance can be provided that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability. We do not have key person insurance.\n\nOur financial results may fluctuate substantially for many reasons, and past results should not be relied on as indications of future performance. \n\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to a combination of factors. Thus, there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. We believe that our revenue and operating results will continue to fluctuate, and that period-to-period comparisons are not necessarily indications of future performance. Our revenue and operating results may fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common shares. In addition, portions of our expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce if our revenues do not meet our expectations. These fixed expenses magnify the adverse effect of any revenue shortfall.\n\nOur plans for implementing our business strategy and achieving profitability are based upon the experience, judgment and assumptions of our key management personnel, and available information concerning the communications and technology industries. If management‚Äôs assumptions prove to be incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. \n\n23\n\nWe have made a number of acquisitions in the past and we may make acquisitions in the future. Our ability to identify complementary assets, products or businesses for acquisition and successfully integrate them could affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nIn the future, we may continue to pursue acquisitions of assets, products, or businesses that we believe are complementary to our existing business and/or to enhance our market position or expand our product portfolio. There is a risk that we will not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices, complete any acquisition, or successfully integrate any acquired product or business into our operations. We are likely to face competition for acquisition candidates from other parties including those that have substantially greater available resources. Acquisitions may involve a number of other risks, including:\n\n‚Ä¢diversion of management‚Äôs attention;\n\n‚Ä¢disruption to our ongoing business;\n\n‚Ä¢failure to retain key acquired personnel;\n\n‚Ä¢failure to obtain required regulatory approvals;\n\n‚Ä¢difficulties in integrating acquired operations, technologies, products, or personnel;\n\n‚Ä¢unanticipated expenses, events, or circumstances;\n\n‚Ä¢assumption of disclosed and undisclosed liabilities; and\n\n‚Ä¢inappropriate valuation of the acquired in-process research and development, or the entire acquired business.\n\nIf we do not successfully address these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition, the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, our success will depend, in part, on the extent to which we are able to integrate acquired companies (and any additional businesses with which we may combine in the future) into a cohesive, efficient enterprise. This integration process may entail significant costs and delays. Our failure to integrate the operations of companies successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. To the extent that any acquisition results in additional goodwill, it will reduce our tangible net worth, which might adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as our credit capacity and if we proceed with an acquisition, our available cash may be used to complete the transaction, diminishing our liquidity and capital resources, or shares may be issued which could cause significant dilution to existing shareholders.\n\nWe have implemented cost reduction efforts; however, these efforts may need to be modified, and if we need to implement additional cost reduction efforts it could materially harm our business. \n\nWe have implemented certain cost reduction efforts. There can be no assurance that these cost reduction efforts will be successful. As a result, we may need to implement further cost reduction efforts across our operations, such as further reductions in the cost of our workforce and/or suspending or curtailing planned programs, either of which could materially harm our business, results of operations and future prospects.\n\nRisks Related to Our Public Company Status and Our Common Shares\n\nSales of common shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants, the conversion of outstanding preferred shares, or the effectiveness of our registration statement may cause the market price of our common shares to decline. Currently outstanding preferred shares could adversely affect the rights of the holders of common shares. \n\nOn October 1, 2021, we filed articles of amendment to create a series of preferred shares, being, an unlimited number of Series H Preferred Shares and to provide for the rights, privileges, restrictions, and conditions attaching thereto. Pursuant to the articles of amendment governing the rights and preferences of outstanding shares of Series H Preferred Shares, each holder of the Series H Preferred Shares, may, subject to prior shareholder approval, convert all or any part of the Series H Preferred Shares provided that after such conversion the common shares issuable, together with all the common shares held by the shareholder in the aggregate would not exceed 9.99% of the total number of our outstanding common shares. The Series H Preferred Shares are non-voting and do not accrue dividends.\n\n24\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had in the aggregate 43,515 Series H Preferred Shares outstanding. The conversion of the outstanding Preferred Shares will result in substantial dilution to our common shareholders. Pursuant to our articles of amalgamation, our Board of Directors has the authority to fix and determine the voting rights, rights of redemption and other rights and preferences of preferred stock. The Modified Hertford Agreement also provides for certain resale restrictions applicable to the common shares that are issuable upon the conversion of the remaining Series H Preferred Shares during the two-year period ending on December 31, 2024, which are different from the restrictions contained in the Hertford Agreement, as well, commencing January 1, 2023 and terminating on December 31, 2023, holders of Series H Preferred Shares are permitted to (a) convert Series H Preferred Shares in an aggregate amount up to or equal to 3.0% of the aggregate number of Series H Preferred Shares outstanding on the first day of each such month and (b) sell the resulting number (and no greater number) of such converted common shares within such month. Commencing January 1, 2024 and terminating on December 31, 2024, holders of Series H Preferred Shares are permitted to (a) convert Series H Preferred Shares in an aggregate amount up to or equal to 10.0% of the aggregate number of Series H Preferred Shares outstanding on the first day of each such month and (b) sell the resulting number (and no greater number) of such converted common shares within such month.\n\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2023 we had warrants outstanding for the purchase of up to 5,842,354 common shares having a weighted-average exercise price of $28.50 per share. The sale of our common shares upon exercise of our outstanding warrants, the conversion of the Preferred Shares into common shares, or the sale of a significant amount of the common shares issued or issuable upon exercise of the warrants in the open market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common shares to decline or become highly volatile.\n\nWe may issue additional shares or other equity securities without your approval, which would dilute your ownership interest in us and may depress the market price of our common shares.\n\nWe may issue additional shares or other equity securities in the future in connection with, among other things, future acquisitions, repayment of outstanding indebtedness or grants without shareholder approval in a number of circumstances. The issuance of additional shares or other equity securities could have one or more of the following effects:\n\n‚Ä¢our existing shareholders‚Äô proportionate ownership interest will decrease;\n\n‚Ä¢the amount of cash available per share, including for payment of dividends in the future, may decrease;\n\n‚Ä¢the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding share may be diminished; and\n\n‚Ä¢the market price of our common shares may decline.\n\nThe market price of our common shares is volatile and it may decline significantly.\n\nThe market price for our common shares is volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\n‚Ä¢price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, the crypto asset market, and of Bitcoin mining stocks from time to time;\n\n‚Ä¢future capital raising activities;\n\n‚Ä¢sales of common shares by holders thereof or by us;\n\n‚Ä¢changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow us, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\n‚Ä¢the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;\n\n‚Ä¢rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\n‚Ä¢actual or anticipated changes in our operating results or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\n‚Ä¢actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors‚Äô businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\n25\n\n‚Ä¢litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\n‚Ä¢developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\n‚Ä¢announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\n‚Ä¢new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to us and our business;\n\n‚Ä¢any significant change in our executive officers and other key personnel or Board of Directors;\n\n‚Ä¢release of transfer restrictions on certain outstanding common shares; and\n\n‚Ä¢fluctuating or anticipated changes in power markets.\n\nFinancial markets may experience price and volume fluctuations that affect the market prices of equity securities of companies and that are unrelated to the operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. Accordingly, the market price of the common shares may decline even if our operating results, underlying asset values or prospects have not changed. As well, certain institutional investors may base their investment decisions on consideration of our governance and social practices and performance against such institutions‚Äô respective investment guidelines and criteria, and failure to meet such criteria may result in a limited or no investment in our common shares by those institutions, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares. There can be no assurance that fluctuations in price and volume will not occur due to these and other factors.\n\nIn the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be a target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management‚Äôs attention from day-to-day operations and consume resources, such as cash. In addition, the resolution of those matters may require us to issue additional common shares, which could potentially result in dilution to our existing shareholders. Expenses incurred in connection with these matters (which include fees of lawyers and other professional advisors and potential obligations to indemnify officers and directors who may be parties to such actions) could adversely affect our cash position.\n\nIf our performance does not meet market expectations, the price of our common shares may decline.\n\nIf our performance does not meet market expectations, the price of our common shares may decline. The market value of our common shares may vary significantly from the price of our common shares on the date of this Annual Report.\n\nIn addition, fluctuations in the price of our common shares could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our common shares and our common shares may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. Factors affecting the trading price of our common shares may include:\n\n‚Ä¢actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial results or the financial results of companies perceived to be similar to it;\n\n‚Ä¢changes in the market‚Äôs expectations about our operating results;\n\n‚Ä¢success of competitors;\n\n‚Ä¢our operating results failing to meet market expectations in a particular period;\n\n‚Ä¢changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us;\n\n‚Ä¢operating and share price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\n‚Ä¢changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\n‚Ä¢commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n\n‚Ä¢changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\n‚Ä¢the volume of our shares available for public sale;\n\n‚Ä¢any significant change in our board or management;\n\n26\n\n‚Ä¢sales of substantial amounts of shares by our directors, executive officers or significant shareholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\n‚Ä¢general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\n\nBroad market and industry factors may depress the market price of our common shares irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general and Nasdaq have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for technology, Bitcoin mining or sustainability-related stocks or the stocks of other companies that investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our share price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our common shares also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\n\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\n\nOur share price may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their shares have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management‚Äôs attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\n\nWe will continue to incur substantial costs and obligations as a result of being a public company.\n\nAs a publicly-traded company, we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In addition, new and changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure for public companies, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the ‚ÄúSarbanes-Oxley Act‚Äù), regulations related thereto and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (‚ÄúSEC‚Äù) and Nasdaq, have increased the costs and the time that must be devoted to compliance matters. We expect these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial costs and lead to a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities.\n\nWe must comply with the financial reporting requirements of a public company, as well as other requirements associated with being listed on Nasdaq.\n\nWe are subject to reporting and other obligations under applicable Canadian securities laws, SEC rules and the rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market. These reporting and other obligations, including National Instrument 52-102 - Continuous Disclosure Obligations and National Instrument 52-109 - Certification of Disclosure in Issuers‚Äô Annual and Interim Filings, place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational, and accounting resources. Moreover, any failure to maintain effective internal controls could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be materially harmed, which could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could result in a lower trading price of our common shares.\n\nManagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues within a company are detected. The inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. Due to the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error, or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n\n27\n\nWe may be treated as a Passive Foreign Investment Company.\n\nThere is also an ongoing risk that we may be treated as a Passive Foreign Investment Company (‚ÄúPFIC‚Äù), for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A non-U.S. corporation generally will be considered to be a PFIC for any taxable year in which 75% or more of its gross income is passive income, or 50% or more of the average value of its assets are considered ‚Äúpassive assets‚Äù (generally, assets that generate passive income). This determination is highly factual, and will depend upon, among other things, our market valuation and future financial performance. Based on current business plans and financial expectations, we do not believe we were a PFIC for our tax year ended December 31, 2023, and based on current business plans and financial expectations, we expect that we will not be a PFIC for our current tax year ending December 31, 2024 or for the foreseeable future. If we were to be classified as a PFIC for any future taxable year, holders of our common shares who are U.S. taxpayers would be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.\n\nCertain of our directors, officers and management could be in a position of conflict of interest. \n\nCertain of our directors, officers and members of management may also serve as directors and/or officers of other companies. We may contract with such directors, officers, members of management and such other companies or with affiliated parties or other companies in which such directors, officers, or members of management own or control. These persons may obtain compensation and other benefits in transactions relating to us. Consequently, there exists the possibility for such directors, officers, and members of management to be in a position of conflict.\n\nFuture sales of common shares by directors, officers and other shareholders could adversely affect the prevailing market price for common shares.\n\nSubject to compliance with applicable securities laws, officers, directors and other shareholders and their respective affiliates may sell some or all of their common shares in the future. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, such future sales will have on the market price of the common shares prevailing from time to time. However, the future sale of a substantial number of common shares by our officers, directors and other shareholders and their respective affiliates, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common shares.\n\nWe may issue an unlimited number of common shares. Future sales of common shares will dilute your shares.\n\nOur articles permit the issuance of an unlimited number of common shares, and shareholders will have no preemptive rights in connection with such further issuances. Our directors have the discretion to determine the price and the terms of issue of further issuances of common shares in accordance with applicable laws.\n\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\n\nNot applicable.\n\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\n\nWe understand the importance of preventing, assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity processes to assess, identify and manage risks from cybersecurity threats have been incorporated as a part of our overall risk assessment process and have been embedded in our operating procedures, internal controls and information systems. We have engaged a third-party vendor to provide a variety of cybersecurity services ranging from ongoing security advisory services to cybersecurity monitoring and response management.\n\nWe use a risk-based approach to identifying and overseeing cybersecurity risks presented by third parties, including vendors, service providers and other external users of our systems, as well as the systems of third parties that could adversely impact our business in the event of a cybersecurity incident affecting those third-party systems. For third parties that we rely upon for certain IT systems, we seek to use only reputable providers, to use the most recently reliable versions of such systems, and monitor and address alerts for potential vulnerabilities to any such systems. We do not believe that risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. \n\n28\n\nOur Board of Directors oversees management‚Äôs processes for identifying and mitigating risks, including cybersecurity risks, to help align our risk exposure with our strategic objectives. Our Chief Executive Officer is responsible for assessing and managing cybersecurity risks, responding to any cybersecurity incidents and reporting any such incidents to our Board of Directors, and periodically briefs our Board of Directors on our cybersecurity and information security posture and on any cybersecurity incidents deemed to have a moderate or higher business impact. In the event of a material cybersecurity incident, our cybersecurity consultant has extensive information technology and program management experience. We believe that we have implemented a governance structure and processes that are equipped to assess, identify, manage and report cybersecurity risks. Refer to ‚ÄúItem 1A. Risk Factors‚Äù for a discussion of certain of the cybersecurity risks that our business is subject to. As a smaller reporting company, with respect to compliance with Form 8-K incident disclosure requirements, we are required to comply with the reporting requirements beginning June 15, 2024.\n\nItem 2. Properties\n\nWe are a remote-first company, meaning that for the vast majority of roles, our employees have the option to work remotely. As a result of this strategy, we do not maintain a corporate headquarters. We believe that our remote working strategy is adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future, and that, should we need physical office space, suitable space will be available in the future.\n\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\n\nFor a discussion of our legal proceedings, see Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\n\nNot applicable.\n\n29\n\nPART II\n\nItem 5. Market For Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n\nOur common shares are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol ‚ÄúANY‚Äù. As of March 4, 2024, we had approximately 37 shareholders of record and beneficial owners of our common shares.\n\nDividends\n\nWe have not declared or paid any dividends on our common shares to date. Our current intention is to retain any future earnings to support the development of the business of Sphere 3D and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors of Sphere 3D after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to the financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that Sphere 3D may be a party to at the time. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Sphere 3D common shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment.\n\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\n\nNone.\n\nItem 6. [Reserved]\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in Part I, Item 1A. Risks Factors, and elsewhere in this Annual Report. References to ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù are Notes included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nShare Consolidation\n\nOn June 28, 2023, we filed Articles of Amendment to effect a share consolidation (also known as a reverse stock split) of our issued and outstanding common shares on a 1-for-7 basis. The share consolidation became effective on June 28, 2023. All share and per share amounts have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the share consolidation.\n\nOverview\n\nIn January 2022, we commenced operations of our digital mining business and are dedicated to becoming a leader in the Blockchain and Crypto Industry. We have established and continue to grow an enterprise-scale mining operation through the procurement of mining equipment and partnering with experienced service providers. In addition to digital mining, through December 28, 2023, we delivered data management and desktop and application virtualization solutions through hybrid cloud, cloud and on premise implementations by its reseller network. We achieved this through a combination of containerized applications, virtual desktops, virtual storage and physical hyper-converged platforms. On December 28, 2023, we sold our service and product segment which included HVE ConneXions and Unified ConneXions.\n\nWe owned approximately 13,530 miners as of December 31, 2023, of which approximately 12,800 were in service. We do not have scheduled downtime for our miners. We periodically perform both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance on our miners, but such downtime has not historically been significant. Depending on the type of repair, the miner may run at a reduced speed or be taken offline. We use multiple software programs to monitor the performance of our machines. The miners owned as of December 31, 2023 have a range of energy efficiency (joules per terahash ‚Äì ‚ÄúJ/th‚Äù) of 21.5 to 38 J/th with an average energy efficiency of 28.4 J/th. The miner efficiency is an indication of how efficient we can earn Bitcoin and minimize cost to run the miner.\n\n30\n\nWe obtain Bitcoin as a result of our mining operations, and we sell Bitcoin from time to time, to support our operations and strategic growth. We do not currently plan to engage in regular trading of Bitcoin (other than as necessary to convert our Bitcoin into U.S. dollars) or to engage in hedging activities related to our holding of Bitcoin; however, our decisions to hold or sell Bitcoin at any given time may be impacted by the Bitcoin market, which has been historically characterized by significant volatility. Currently, we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or when we will sell Bitcoin that we hold, or the number of Bitcoins we will sell. Rather, decisions to hold or sell Bitcoins are currently determined by management by analyzing forecasts and monitoring the market in real time. We have a hybrid treasury strategy to hold Bitcoin when possible, and sell at peaks or sell to fund working capital requirements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we held approximately 23.8 Bitcoin. The carrying value of our Bitcoin as of December 31, 2023 was $1.0 million on our consolidated balance sheet. We account for our Bitcoin as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are subject to impairment losses if the fair value of our Bitcoin decreases below their carrying value at any time since their acquisition. Impairment losses cannot be recovered for any subsequent increase in fair value. The carrying value of each Bitcoin we held at the end of each reporting period reflects the lowest price of one Bitcoin quoted on the active exchange at any time since its acquisition. Therefore, negative swings in the market price of Bitcoin could have a material impact on our earnings and on the carrying value of our Bitcoin.\n\nRecent Key Events\n\n‚Ä¢On January 16, 2024 we reached a settlement agreement (the ‚ÄúSettlement Agreement‚Äù) with Core Scientific Inc., which was approved by a United States Bankruptcy Judge on January 16, 2024 as part of Core Scientific‚Äôs emergence from bankruptcy, for $10.0 million of Core Scientific‚Äôs equity. The Settlement Agreement includes access to potential additional funds for interest as well as an additional equity pool if the value of Core Scientific‚Äôs equity decreases in the 18 months after the date of the Settlement Agreement commensurate with the other unsecured creditors. On January 23, 2024, we received 2,050,982 common shares of Core Scientific Inc. trading under the Nasdaq symbol CORZ.\n\n‚Ä¢In January 2024, we granted 1,114,942 RSUs with a fair value of $2.2 million and vesting periods of up to two years and 246,150 options with a fair value of $0.5 million and a vesting period of 11 months.\n\n‚Ä¢Subsequent to December 31, 2023, pursuant to the Modified Hertford Agreement, we issued 2,422,710 common shares for the conversion of 16,959 Series H Preferred Shares.\n\n‚Ä¢On December 28, 2023, we entered into a share purchase agreement with Joseph O‚ÄôDaniel (‚ÄúPurchaser‚Äù), a related party, under which we sold our service and product segment, including HVE ConneXions and Unified ConneXions, for $1.00 and the transfer of outstanding assets and liabilities. As a result of the share purchase agreement, the Purchaser, who served as our President, resigned effective December 28, 2023. We recognized a noncash gain of $0.7 million related to the transfer of net liabilities to the Purchaser.\n\n‚Ä¢On December 19, 2023, our 3,162,500 shares of Minority Equality Opportunities Acquisition Inc. (‚ÄúMEOA‚Äù) Class B common stock were cancelled, eliminating our ownership of MEOA, and we recognized a $6.1 million gain related to the deconsolidation of MEOA.\n\n‚Ä¢On October 6, 2023, in accordance with the cure period, we terminated the Gryphon MSA. In November 2023, Gryphon indicated that upon receipt of certain information it would remit outstanding Bitcoin proceeds, less fees and expenses that we assert is currently held by Gryphon on behalf of us, which we believe amounts to approximately 21.6 Bitcoin and approximately $0.6 million of revenue at December 31, 2023, before factoring in fees and expenses. Due to the uncertainty regarding when we would receive the Bitcoin, the Bitcoin proceeds, less fees and expenses, will be recognized when received.\n\n31\n\nResults of Operations - Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\n\nRevenue\n\nWe had revenue of $21.9 million during 2023 compared to $6.1 million during 2022. The $15.8 million increase in revenue is due to the increase of $16.3 million in revenues from our digital mining operation, offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in service and product. The majority of our revenue was derived from digital currency mining and data management services. Income from our mining segment is a result of Bitcoin mining activities in the United States. Income from our product and services segment is primarily generated in the United States. On December 28, 2023, we sold our service and product segment.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nCost of Revenue\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, direct cost of revenues were $15.9 million and $3.4 million, respectively, representing an increase of $12.5 million primarily due to the increase in miners deployed related to our digital mining operation. \n\nSales and Marketing Expense\n\nSales and marketing expenses were $0.9 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease of $0.1 million was primarily due to a $0.2 million decrease in employee related costs associated with a lower average headcount, offset by an increase in share-based compensation.\n\nResearch and Development Expense\n\nResearch and development expenses were $1.0 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase of $0.4 million was primarily due to a $0.2 million increase in employee and related expenses associated with internal projects, and $0.2 million due to severance costs.\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $15.8 million and $24.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease of $8.3 million was primarily due to decreases of approximately $6.1 million in share-based compensation related to awards, $5.8 million associated with outside services primarily related to our 2022 expansion into the digital mining industry, $1.9 million for costs related to former proposed merger transaction that was terminated in 2022, and $0.3 million in other costs. These decreases were offset by increases of $2.8 million for legal expenses associated with litigation with Core Scientific Inc. and Gryphon Digital Mining Inc., a prior year nonrecurring adjustment of $1.4 million for a change in fair value of a crypto asset payable, $0.9 million related to formation and operating costs for MEOA, our special purpose acquisition company (‚ÄúSPAC‚Äù), $0.5 million of additional insurance cost, and $0.2 million in director fees.\n\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $6.2 million and $28.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease of $22.1 million was primarily due to fully amortized supplier agreements related to our digital mining machines.\n\n32\n\nProvision for Losses on Deposits Due to Vendor Bankruptcy Filings\n\nProvision for losses on deposits due to vendor bankruptcy filings was $8.5 million and $16.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily as a result of two vendors filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nImpairment of Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nImpairment of acquired intangible assets were $3.0 million and $13.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2023, an impairment charge of $1.7 million was recorded for the carbon credits held for future use due to a certain vendor who was not able to perform under terms of the agreement. In addition, an impairment charge of $1.2 million was recorded for one supplier agreement due to an adverse change in the business climate which indicated that an impairment triggering event occurred. For the year ended December 31, 2022, an impairment charge of $13.2 million was recorded for supplier agreements due to adverse changes in the business climate, including the decline in the price of Bitcoin and two of our vendors, Core Scientific and Compute North filing for bankruptcy.\n\nRealized Gain on Sale of Bitcoin\n\nRealized gain on sale of Bitcoin was $1.1 million and $19,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was due to the sale of Bitcoin and the difference between the sales proceeds from the Bitcoin and the carrying amount. Typically gains are higher when Bitcoin prices are increasing over a holding period. \n\nLoss on Disposal of Property and Equipment\n\nLoss on disposal of property and equipment was $1.0 million and nil for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and related to the sale of mining equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 3,336 miners that were included in mining equipment, for cash proceeds of $4.5 million.\n\nImpairment of Bitcoin\n\nImpairment of Bitcoin was $0.7 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease of $0.4 million was due to a reduction in impairment losses recognized on our Bitcoin. An impairment analysis is performed daily to determine if the lowest intraday price of Bitcoin is lower than the Company‚Äôs carrying value for Bitcoin until the Company‚Äôs Bitcoin is sold or until the end of the reporting period, whichever comes first. If the carrying value of the digitalassets exceeds the fair value based on the lowest intraday quoted price as reported in our principal market during the period, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their carrying values and the price determined.\n\nImpairment of Mining Equipment\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, adverse changes in the business climate, including the decline in the price of Bitcoin and two vendor bankruptcy filings, indicated that an impairment triggering event occurred, and it was determined the carrying value of mining equipment exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result of the analysis, an impairment charge on mining equipment of $75.9 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n33\n\nNon-Operating Income and Expenses\n\nGain on Deconsolidation of Special Purpose Acquisition Company\n\nGain on deconsolidation of MEOA, our SPAC, was $6.1 million and nil for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On December 19, 2023, our 3,162,500 shares of MEOA‚Äôs Class B common stock were cancelled, eliminating our ownership of MEOA, and we recognized a $6.1 million gain related to the deconsolidation of MEOA.\n\nGain on Disposal of Service and Product Segment - Related Party\n\nGain on disposal of service and product segment was $0.7 million and nil for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On December 28, 2023, Sphere 3D and Joseph O‚ÄôDaniel (‚ÄúPurchaser‚Äù), entered into a share purchase agreement under which we sold our service and product segment, which included HVE ConneXions and Unified ConneXions, for $1.00 and the transfer of outstanding assets and liabilities. As a result of the share purchase agreement, the Purchaser, who served as our President, resigned effective December 28, 2023. We recognized a noncash gain of $0.7 million related to the transfer of net liabilities to the Purchaser.\n\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense was $1.2 million and nil for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase of $1.2 million was related to $1.0 million for warrants issued with our LDA convertible debt and $0.2 million of debt costs and interest expense.\n\nInterest Income and Other Expense, Net\n\nInterest income and other expense, net, was $1.1 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2023, interest income and other expense, net, primarily related to a $1.0 million fair value adjustment for warrant liabilities, and $0.2 million in interest income from previously restricted funds that were held in a trust, offset by $0.1 million in other miscellaneous expenses. In 2022, we recognized a gain on forgiveness of liabilities of $2.1 million and interest income of $0.6 million from our notes receivable.\n\nImpairment of Investments\n\nImpairment of investments was nil and $14.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease of $14.5 million was due to a prior year $12.4 million impairment loss recognized on our Filecoiner investments, and $2.1 million impairment loss recognized on our Silicon Valley Technology Partners Preferred Shares. The fair value of the Filecoiner investments was impacted by the decrease in the price of Filecoin since the time of the investments resulting in an impairment.\n\nForgiveness of Note Receivable\n\nForgiveness of note receivable was nil and $13.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease of $13.1 million was due to the prior year forgiveness of our note receivable, including accrued interest, with Gryphon which occurred when the Merger Agreement with Gryphon was terminated by us on April 4, 2022.\n\nProvision for Losses on Deposit for Mining Equipment\n\nProvision for deposit on mining equipment was nil and $10.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease of $10.0 million was due to a prior year provision made for the deposit we made to NuMiner Global, Inc. for the purchase of mining machines.\n\n34\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe have recurring losses from operations. Our primary source of cash flow is generated from digital mining revenue and service revenue through December 28, 2023. In addition, we have financed our operations through proceeds from the issuance of private and public sales of securities. At December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $0.6 million compared to $1.3 million at December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, we had working capital of $8.2 million, reflecting an increase in current assets of $3.2 million and a decrease in current liabilities of $0.9 million compared to December 31, 2022. The increase in current assets was primarily related to a $10.0 million recovery of a deposit for prepaid hosting services, primarily offset by decreases of $3.8 million for notes receivable, $1.7 million for cash, restricted cash, and digital asset related balances, and $1.1 million for prepaid services and other. The decrease in current liabilities was primarily related to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Cash management continues to be a top priority. We expect to incur negative operating cash flows as we work to increase our digital mining revenue and maintain operational efficiencies. \n\nIn August 2023, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the ‚ÄúPurchase Agreement‚Äù) pursuant to which we issued to two investors a total of 13,764 of our Series H Preferred Shares and a total of 1,966,293 common share purchase warrants (the ‚ÄúWarrants‚Äù), each of which entitled the holder to purchase one of our common shares (the ‚ÄúWarrant Shares‚Äù). Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we received gross proceeds of $3.0 million. We issued a total of 1,377 Series H Preferred Shares and 196,629 warrants as a finder‚Äôs fee for the transaction with an aggregate fair value of $0.5 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we will reserve for issuance the maximum aggregate number of common shares that are issuable upon exercise in full of the Warrants at any time.\n\nThe Warrants issued in connection with the Purchase Agreement are exercisable beginning February 23, 2024 at an initial exercise price of $2.75 per share and have a term of three years from the date of issuance. The exercise price of the Warrants are subject to adjustment for certain stock splits, stock combinations and dilutive share issuances.\n\nManagement has projected that based on our hashing rate at December 31, 2023, cash on hand may not be sufficient to allow the Company to continue operations and there is substantial doubt about the Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date of issuance of the financial statements if we are unable to raise additional funding for operations. We expect our working capital needs to increase in the future as we continue to expand and enhance our operations. Our ability to raise additional funds for working capital through equity or debt financings or other sources may depend on the financial success of our then current business and successful implementation of our key strategic initiatives, financial, economic and market conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Further equity financings may have a dilutive effect on shareholders and any debt financing, if available, may require restrictions to be placed on our future financing and operating activities. If we require additional capital and are unsuccessful in raising that capital at a reasonable cost and at the required times, or at all, we may not be able to continue our business operations in the cryptocurrency mining industry or we may be unable to advance our growth initiatives, either of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nSignificant changes from our current forecasts, including but not limited to: (i) shortfalls from projected mining earning levels; (ii) increases in operating costs; (iii) fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrency; and (iv) inability to maintain compliance with the requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market and/or inability to maintain listing with the NASDAQ Capital Market could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access the level of funding necessary to continue our operations at current levels. If any of these events occurs or we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or financing sources, we may be forced to liquidate assets where possible and/or curtail, suspend or cease planned programs or operations generally or seek bankruptcy protection or be subject to an involuntary bankruptcy petition, any of, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\n\nThese factors, among others, indicate there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date of issuance of the financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\n35\n\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities, investing activities and financing activities (in thousands):\n\nYear Ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023| 2022  \nNet cash used in operating activities| $| (6,582)| $| (30,771)  \nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities| $| 2,561 | $| (22,041)  \nNet cash provided by financing activities| $| 3,064 | $| ‚Äî   \n  \nNet cash used in operating activities. The use of cash during 2023 was primarily a result of our net loss of $23.3 million, offset by $15.7 million in noncash items, which primarily included provision for losses on deposits made due to vendor bankruptcy filings, depreciation and amortization, gain on the deconsolidation of our SPAC, impairments of acquired intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, Bitcoin issued for services, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, realized gain on the sale of Bitcoin, warrants issued with convertible debt, loss on the disposal of mining equipment, impairment of Bitcoin, gain on the disposal of our service and product segment, and the noncash exercise of warrants.\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities. During 2023, we sold 3,336 miners originally included in mining equipment, for cash proceeds of $4.5 million, our SPAC received $10.3 million from the redemption of the trust account and paid $10.4 million for the redemption of the redeemable non-controlling interest related to MEOA, and we paid $1.6 million towards digital asset mining machines and shipping costs. During 2022, we paid $17.6 million towards digital asset mining machines and shipping costs, we entered into promissory notes receivable with Gryphon and MEOA for $2.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, and we purchased $0.3 million of carbon credits for future use. The Gryphon note receivable was forgiven on April 4, 2022 upon termination of the Merger Agreement with Gryphon.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities. During 2023, we received $3.0 million from the issuance of preferred shares and warrants, $0.8 million, net, from the issuance of a convertible note, and $0.6 million from the exercise of stock options. These inflows were offset by $1.3 million of payments made on our convertible debt which was paid in full in August 2023.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Information\n\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we may provide standby letters of credit to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by us. As of December 31, 2023, we have no standby letters of credit outstanding.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We review our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In 2022, we believe the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include estimates associated with the impairment analysis of long-lived assets. Our significant accounting policies include revenue recognition and long-lived assets and are outlined in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nRefer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect, if any, on us.\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nAs a ‚Äúsmaller reporting company‚Äù as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item.\n\n36\n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nOur consolidated financial statements and supplementary data required by this item are set forth at the pages indicated in Item 15(a)(1) and 15(a)(2), respectively.\n\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\nNone.\n\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures \n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurance that information required to be publicly disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. \n\nManagement‚Äôs Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, using the criteria in the updated Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (‚ÄúCOSO‚Äù). Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nBased on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report on internal control over financial reporting was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this Annual Report.\n\nThis report on internal control over financial reporting shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and is not incorporated by reference into any of our filings, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nItem 9B. Other Information\n\nNone.\n\nItem 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\n\nNot applicable.\n\n37\n\nPART III\n\nItem 10.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nGoing Concern Matter\n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and does not expect to have sufficient working capital to fund its operations that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company‚Äôs management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company‚Äôs financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nF-1\n\nEvaluation of the Accounting for and Disclosure of Bitcoin Mining Revenue Recognized \n\nAs disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company provides computing power to its mining pools and in exchange for providing such computing power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed bitcoin award earned, plus a fractional share of the transaction fees, less net digital asset fees due to the mining pool operator over the measurement period. The Company‚Äôs fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized net bitcoin mining revenue of approximately $19.7 million. The Company‚Äôs management has exercised significant judgment in their determination of how existing GAAP should be applied to the accounting for and disclosure of bitcoin mining revenue recognized.\n\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:\n\n‚Ä¢Evaluated management‚Äôs rationale for the application of Topic 606 to account for bitcoin awards earned;\n\n‚Ä¢Evaluated management‚Äôs disclosures of its bitcoin activities in the financial statement footnotes;\n\n‚Ä¢Evaluated and tested management‚Äôs rationale and supporting documentation associated with the valuation of bitcoin awards earned;\n\n‚Ä¢Independently confirmed certain financial data and wallet records directly with the mining pools;\n\n‚Ä¢Compared the Company‚Äôs wallet records of bitcoin mining revenue received to publicly available blockchain records; and\n\n‚Ä¢Undertook an analytical review of total bitcoin mining revenue expected to be recognized by the Company by assessing the total hash power contributed onto the network by the Company against total block rewards and transaction fees issued over the year.\n\n/s/ MaloneBailey, LLP\n\nwww.malonebailey.com\n\nWe have served as the Company‚Äôs auditor since 2022.\n\nHouston, Texas\n\nMarch 13, 2024\n\nF-2\n\nSphere 3D Corp.\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except shares)\n\nDecember 31, 2023| December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nAssets  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 586 | $| 1,337  \nDigital assets| 986 | 1,695  \nRestricted cash| ‚Äî | 206  \nAccounts receivable, net| ‚Äî | 174  \nNotes receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $3,821 and $0, respectively| ‚Äî | 3,821  \nOther current assets| 11,938 | 3,051  \nTotal current assets| 13,510 | 10,284  \nProperty and equipment, net| 24,166 | 34,259  \nIntangible assets, net| 4,581 | 9,477  \nFunds held in trust account| ‚Äî | 10,297  \nOther non-current assets| 3,406 | 18,699  \nTotal assets| $| 45,663 | $| 83,016  \nLiabilities, Temporary Equity and Shareholders‚Äô Equity  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable| $| 2,374 | $| 2,993  \nAccrued liabilities| 1,179 | 1,537  \nAccrued payroll and employee compensation| 1,482 | 696  \nWarrant liabilities| 205 | ‚Äî  \nOther current liabilities| 106 | 974  \nTotal current liabilities| 5,346 | 6,200  \nDeferred underwriting fee| ‚Äî | 4,554  \nWarrant liabilities| ‚Äî | 864  \nOther non-current liabilities| ‚Äî | 366  \nTotal liabilities| 5,346 | 11,984  \nCommitments and contingencies (Note 15)  \nSeries H preferred shares, no par value, unlimited shares authorized, 43,515 and 60,000 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively| 13,794 | 26,469  \nRedeemable non-controlling interest| ‚Äî | 9,998  \nTotal temporary equity| 13,794 | 36,467  \nShareholders‚Äô equity:  \nCommon shares, no par value; unlimited shares authorized, 15,373,616 and 9,804,609 shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively| 475,702 | 456,402  \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss| (1,808)| (1,799)  \nAccumulated deficit| (447,371)| (419,732)  \nTotal Sphere 3D Corp. shareholders‚Äô equity| 26,523 | 34,871  \nNon-controlling interest| ‚Äî | (306)  \nTotal shareholders‚Äô equity| 26,523 | 34,565  \nTotal liabilities, temporary equity, and shareholders‚Äô equity| $| 45,663 | $| 83,016  \n  \nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n\nF-3\n\nSphere 3D Corp.\n\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts)\n\nYear Ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023| 2022  \nRevenues:  \nBitcoin mining revenue| $| 19,730 | $| 3,443  \nService and product revenue| 2,176 | 2,634  \nTotal revenues| 21,906 | 6,077  \nOperating costs and expenses:  \nCost of Bitcoin mining revenue| 15,031 | 2,044  \nCost of service and product revenue| 913 | 1,373  \nSales and marketing| 948 | 1,009  \nResearch and development| 1,026 | 605  \nGeneral and administrative| 15,825 | 24,134  \nDepreciation and amortization| 6,190 | 28,263  \nProvision for losses on deposits due to vendor bankruptcy filings| 8,509 | 16,069  \nImpairment of acquired intangible assets| 2,952 | 13,182  \nRealized gain on sale of Bitcoin| (1,131)| (19)  \nLoss on disposal of property and equipment| 960 | ‚Äî  \nImpairment of Bitcoin| 682 | 1,148  \nImpairment of mining equipment| ‚Äî | 75,922  \nTotal operating expenses| 51,905 | 163,730  \nLoss from operations| (29,999)| (157,653)  \nOther income (expense):  \nGain on deconsolidation of SPAC| 6,140 | ‚Äî  \nInterest expense| (1,183)| ‚Äî  \nInterest income and other expense, net| 1,062 | 2,581  \nGain on disposal of service and product segment -

Mining Ventures Inc. On March 24, 2015, the Company completed a short-form amalgamation with a wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with the short-form amalgamation, the Company changed its name to ‚ÄúSphere 3D Corp.‚Äù Any reference to the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù, ‚ÄúSphere 3D‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, or similar terms refers to Sphere 3D Corp. and its subsidiaries. In January 2022, the Company commenced operations of its Bitcoin mining business and is dedicated to becoming a leader in the Blockchain and Crypto Industry. The Company has established and plans to continue to grow an enterprise-scale mining operation through the procurement of mining equipment and partnering with experienced service providers. In addition, through December 28, 2023, the Company delivered data management and desktop and application virtualization solutions through hybrid cloud, cloud and on premise implementations by its global reseller network. On December 28, 2023, the Company sold its service and product segment which included HVE ConneXions and Unified ConneXions.\n\nLiquidity and Going Concern\n\nThe Company has recurring losses from operations and incurred a net loss of approximately $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Management has projected that based on our hashing rate at December 31, 2023, cash on hand may not be sufficient to allow the Company to continue operations and there is substantial doubt about the Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date of issuance of the financial statements if we are unable to raise additional funding for operations. We expect our working capital needs to increase in the future as we continue to expand and enhance our operations. Our ability to raise additional funds for working capital through equity or debt financings or other sources may depend on the financial success of our then current business and successful implementation of our key strategic initiatives, financial, economic and market conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Further equity financings may have a dilutive effect on shareholders and any debt financing, if available, may require restrictions to be placed on our future financing and operating activities. We require additional capital and if we are unsuccessful in raising that capital at a reasonable cost and at the required times, or at all, we may not be able to continue our business operations in the cryptocurrency mining industry or we may be unable to advance our growth initiatives, either of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nSignificant changes from the Company‚Äôs current forecasts, including but not limited to: (i) shortfalls from projected mining earning levels; (ii) increases in operating costs; (iii) fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrency; and (iv) inability to maintain compliance with the requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market and/or inability to maintain listing with the NASDAQ Capital Market could have a material adverse impact on the Company‚Äôs ability to access the level of funding necessary to continue its operations at current levels. If any of these events occurs or the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or financing sources, the Company may be forced to liquidate assets where possible and/or curtail, suspend or cease planned programs or operations generally or seek bankruptcy protection or be subject to an involuntary bankruptcy petition, any of, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company‚Äôs business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\n\nThese factors, among others, indicate there is substantial doubt about the Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date of issuance of the financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\nShare Consolidation\n\nOn June 28, 2023, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to effect a share consolidation (also known as a reverse stock split) of its issued and outstanding common shares on a one-for-seven basis. The share consolidation became effective on June 28, 2023. All share and per share amounts have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the share consolidation.\n\nF-9\n\n2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (‚ÄúGAAP‚Äù), applied on a basis consistent for all periods. Subsidiaries in which controlling interests are maintained are consolidated. All intercompany balances and transactions have been appropriately eliminated in consolidation.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nReclassifications\n\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. The reclassifications did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nForeign Currency Translation\n\nThe financial statements of the Company‚Äôs foreign subsidiary, for which the functional currency is the local currency, is translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at the consolidated balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and a weighted-average exchange rate during the year for revenue, expenses, gains and losses. Translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders‚Äô equity. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Such transactions resulted in a minimal gain and $46,000 loss for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nHighly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original maturities of three months or less, when purchased, are classified as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are composed of money market funds. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to these balances and believes credit risk to be minimal.\n\nRestricted Cash\n\nRestricted cash is cash held in a separate bank account with restrictions on withdrawal. The Company‚Äôs restricted cash was classified as current and pledged as collateral for a standby letter of credit for the bonding purpose necessary for the Company to receive mining machines and was released in 2023.\n\nFunds held in trust account were restricted and invested in U.S. government treasury money market funds. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the proceeds were released from the trust account to MEOA for the redemption of its redeemable public shares as MEOA was unable to complete the required business combination.\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nAccounts receivable is recorded at the invoiced amount and is non-interest bearing. The Company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific accounts and the overall condition of the accounts receivable portfolio. When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company analyzes specific trade and other receivables, historical bad debts, customer credits, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customers‚Äô payment terms and/or patterns. The Company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis and records adjustments as considered necessary. Customer accounts are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is considered uncollectable. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, allowance for doubtful accounts of nil and $3,200, respectively, was recorded. \n\nF-10\n\nDigital Assets\n\nThe Company accounts for its digital assets, Bitcoin, as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The digital assets are recorded at cost less impairment. An impairment analysis is performed daily to determine if the fair value of Bitcoin is lower than the Company‚Äôs carrying value for Bitcoin until the Company‚Äôs Bitcoin is disposed of or until the end of the reporting period, whichever comes first. The fair value of digital assets is determined on a nonrecurring basis based on the lowest intraday quoted price as reported in the Company‚Äôs principal market. If the carrying value of the digitalasset exceeds the fair value an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their carrying values and the fair value determined.\n\nImpairment losses are recognized in operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment is identified. The impaired digital assets are written down to their fair value at the time of impairment and this new cost basis will not be adjusted upward for any subsequent increase in fair value. Gains are not recorded until realized upon sale or disposition. \n\nDigital assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The disposal of digital assets are included within operating activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and any realized gains or losses from such sales are included in operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first in first out (FIFO) method of accounting.\n\nThe following table presents the activities of the digital assets (in thousands):\n\nBalance at January 1, 2022| $| ‚Äî  \n---|---|---  \nAddition of digital assets| 3,443  \nBitcoin issued for services| (600)  \nImpairment loss| (1,148)  \nBalance at December 31, 2022| 1,695  \nAddition of Bitcoin| 19,730  \nBitcoin sold for cash| (18,195)  \nBitcoin issued for services| (1,562)  \nImpairment loss| (682)  \nBalance at December 31, 2023| $| 986  \n  \nAllowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe Company‚Äôs assessment of its allowance for credit losses requires it to incorporate considerations of historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company manages credit risk through review of available public company information. For the Company‚Äôs note receivable, as of December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded an allowance for credit losses and elected to write off accrued interest receivables by reversing interest income.\n\nInvestments\n\nThe Company holds investments in equity securities of public and nonpublic companies for business and strategic purposes. Nonpublic equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value are carried at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The Company reviews its investments on a regular basis to determine if the investments are impaired. For purposes of this assessment, the Company considers the investee‚Äôs cash position, earnings and revenue outlook, liquidity and management ownership, among other factors, in its review. If management‚Äôs assessment indicates that an impairment exists, the Company estimates the fair value of the equity investment and recognizes in current earnings an impairment loss that is equal to the difference between the fair value of the equity investment and its carrying amount.\n\nF-11\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company enters into operating leases primarily for real estate. The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Right of use (‚ÄúROU‚Äù) assets and liabilities resulting from operating leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As the leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the discount rate to calculate the present value of future payments. The operating lease ROU asset may also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. The Company‚Äôs leases do not include options to extend the lease. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. On December 28, 2023, the Company sold its Service and Product segment and no longer has any operating leases or ROU assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment primarily consists of mining equipment and is stated at cost, including purchase price and all shipping and custom fees, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally five years.\n\nThe Company reviews the carrying amounts of property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the fair value of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nFor intangible assets purchased in a business combination, the estimated fair values of the assets received are used to establish their recorded values. For intangible assets acquired in a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred (or the estimated fair values of the assets received, if more clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value.\n\nPurchased intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic lives of five years to 15 years for supplier agreements, six years for channel partner relationships, and seven years for customer relationships as this method most closely reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be consumed. \n\nThe Company has purchased carbon credits. As it intends to use these carbon credits, the assets have been classified as intangible assets. When the carbon credit is used, it is expensed as an operating expense.\n\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\n\nThe Company performs regular reviews of intangible assets to determine if any event has occurred that may indicate that intangible assets with finite useful lives and other long-lived assets are potentially impaired. Triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization. Intangible assets are quantitatively assessed for impairment, if necessary, by comparing their estimated fair values to their carrying values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment.\n\nF-12\n\nWarrant Liabilities\n\nWarrant liabilities are for a common share purchase warrant issued in connection with previously outstanding convertible debt, and warrants for shares of MEOA‚Äôs common stock that are not indexed to its own stock. Warrants are presented as liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. The warrants are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized in interest income and other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nRedeemable Non-controlling Interest\n\nRedeemable non-controlling interest is interest in a subsidiary of the Company that are redeemable outside of the Company‚Äôs control either for cash or other assets. This interest is classified as temporary equity and measured at the estimated redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting increases or decreases in the estimated redemption amount are effected by corresponding charges to accumulated deficit. At December 31, 2022, redeemable non-controlling interest recorded within the Company‚Äôs consolidated balance sheet relates to its subsidiary, MEOA. At December 31, 2023, redeemable non-controlling interest was no longer subject to consolidation with the Company.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company accounts for revenue pursuant to ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments (‚ÄúTopic 606‚Äù). Under Topic 606, an entity is required to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and contract consideration will be recognized on a ‚Äúsell-in basis‚Äù or when control of the purchased goods or services transfer to the distributor. \n\nThe Company is engaged with digital asset mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining pools. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to Full Pay Per Share (‚ÄúFPPS‚Äù), which is a fractional share of the fixed Bitcoin award the mining pool operator receives, plus a fractional share of the transaction fees attached to that blockchain less net digital asset fees due to the mining pool operator over the measurement period, as applicable. The pay-outs received are based on the expected value from the block reward plus the transaction fee reward, regardless of whether the mining pool operator successfully records a block to the blockchain. \n\nThe Company‚Äôs fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party without compensation and the Company‚Äôs enforceable right to compensation only begins when the Company starts providing computing power to the mining pool operator (which occurs daily at midnight Universal Time Coordinated (‚ÄúUTC‚Äù)). The contract arises at the point that the Company provides computing power to the mining pool operator, which is beginning contract day at midnight UTC (contract inception), as customer consumption is in tandem with daily earnings of delivery of the computing power. According to the customer contract, daily earnings are calculated from midnight-to-midnight UTC time, and the sub-account balance is credited one hour later at 1:00 AM UTC time.\n\nThe Company satisfies its performance obligation over time with daily settlement in Bitcoin. The Company‚Äôs performance is completed as it transfers the computing power (hashrate computations) over-time (midnight to midnight) to the customer. The Company has full control of the mining equipment utilized in the mining pool and if the Company determines it will increase or decrease the processing power of its machines and/or fleet (i.e., for repairs or when power costs are excessive) the computing power provided to the customer will be adjusted.\n\nThe transaction consideration the Company receives is noncash consideration in the form of Bitcoin, which the Company measures at fair value at contract inception. The noncash consideration is variable, since the amount of block reward earned depends on the amount of computing power contributed, the amount of transaction fees awarded and operator fees over the same period. The Company does not constrain this variable consideration because it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized from the contract will not occur when the uncertainty is subsequently resolved and recognizes the noncash consideration on the same day that control is transferred, which is the same day as contract inception.\n\nExpenses associated with running the Bitcoin mining operations, such as hosting, operating supplies, utilities and monitoring services are recorded as cost of revenues.\n\nF-13\n\nThe Company also generates revenue from: (i) solutions for standalone storage and integrated hyper-converged storage; (ii) professional services; and (iii) warranty and customer services. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligations.\n\nThe majority of the Company‚Äôs product and service revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied at a point in time. These contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation to transfer products. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue when change of control has been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of shipment of products. The Company sells its products both directly to customers and through distributors generally under agreements with payment terms typically less than 45 days. Revenue on direct product sales, excluding sales to distributors, are not entitled to any specific right of return or price protection, except for any defective product that may be returned under our standard product warranty. Product sales to distribution customers that are subject to certain rights of return, stock rotation privileges and price protections, contain a component of ‚Äúvariable consideration.‚Äù Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products and is generally based upon a negotiated fixed price and is net of estimates for variable considerations.\n\nFor performance obligations related to warranty and customer services, such as extended product warranties, the Company transfers control and recognizes revenue on a time-elapsed basis. The performance obligations are satisfied as services are rendered typically on a stand-ready basis over the contract term, which is generally 12 months.\n\nThe Company also enters into revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple performance obligations of its product and service offerings such as for sales of hardware devices and extended warranty services. The Company allocates contract fees to the performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. The Company determines the stand-alone selling price based on its normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product and/or service when sold separately. When the Company is unable to establish the individual stand-alone price for all elements in an arrangement by reference to sold separately instances, the Company may estimate the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation using a cost plus a margin approach, by reference to third party evidence of selling price, based on the Company‚Äôs actual historical selling prices of similar items, or based on a combination of the aforementioned methodologies; whichever management believes provides the most reliable estimate of stand-alone selling price.\n\nExtended Warranty \n\nSeparately priced extended on-site warranties and service contracts are offered for sale to customers on all product lines. Extended warranty and service contract revenue and recognized as service revenue over the period of the service agreement. The Company will typically apply the practical expedient to agreements wherein the period between transfer of any good or service in the contract and when the customer pays for that good or service is one year or less. On December 28, 2023, the Company sold its service and product segment and no longer has any deferred revenue for extended on-site warranties and service contracts as of December 31, 2023.\n\nShipping and Handling\n\nAmounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue, and costs incurred related to shipping and handling are included in cost of product revenue.\n\nResearch and Development Costs\n\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, share-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs. Research and development expenses are charged to operating expenses as incurred when these expenditures relate to the Company‚Äôs research and development efforts and have no alternative future uses.\n\nF-14\n\nSegment Information\n\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding the method to allocate resources and assess performance. Through the period ended December 28, 2023, the Company had two operating segments. On December 28, 2023, the Company sold its service and product segment.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company provides for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes generally represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when a judgment is made that it is considered more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. A decision to record a valuation allowance results in an increase in income tax expense or a decrease in income tax benefit. If the valuation allowance is released in a future period, income tax expense will be reduced accordingly.\n\nThe calculation of tax liabilities involves evaluating uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. The impact of an uncertain income tax position is recognized at the largest amount that is ‚Äúmore likely than not‚Äù to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.\n\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nComprehensive income (loss) and its components encompass all changes in equity other than those arising from transactions with shareholders, including net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments, and is disclosed in a separate consolidated statement of comprehensive loss.\n\nConcentration of Credit Risks\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable, which are generally not collateralized. To reduce credit risk, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses for estimated bad debt losses.\n\nShare-based Compensation\n\nThe Company accounts for share-based awards, and similar equity instruments, granted to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share-based compensation. Share-based compensation award types may include stock options and restricted stock units (‚ÄúRSUs‚Äù) and restricted stock awards (‚ÄúRSAs‚Äù). Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) except for options with graded vesting which is recognized pursuant to an accelerated method. Forfeitures are recognized as a reduction in share-based compensation expense as they occur.\n\nNon-controlling Interest\n\nThe Company accounts for its non-controlling interest in accordance with the authoritative guidance for consolidation which governs the accounting for and reporting of non-controlling interests (‚ÄúNCIs‚Äù) in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of control of subsidiaries. Certain provisions of the guidance indicate, among other things, that NCIs be treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability, that increases and decreases in the parent‚Äôs ownership interest that leave control intact be treated as equity transactions rather than as step acquisitions or dilution gains or losses, and that losses of a partially owned consolidated subsidiary be allocated to the NCI even when such allocation might result in a deficit balance. The net income (loss) attributed to the NCI is separately designated in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2023, the Company no longer owned a controlling interest in MEOA and as such the non-controlling interest was no longer subject to consolidation with the Company.\n\nF-15\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‚ÄúFASB‚Äù) that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. If not discussed, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities with a single reportable segment to provide all the disclosures required by this standard and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280 on an interim and annual basis, including new requirements to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (‚ÄúCODM‚Äù) and included within the reported measure(s) of a segment's profit or loss, the amount and composition of any other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of a segment's profit or loss to assess performance and decide how to allocate resources. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, applied retrospectively with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, Intangibles - Goodwill - and Other - Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting For and Disclosure of Crypto Assets, which requires that an entity measure crypto assets at fair value in the statement of financial position each reporting period and recognize changes from remeasurement in net income. The amendments also require that an entity provide enhanced disclosures for both annual and interim reporting periods to provide investors with relevant information to analyze and assess the exposure and risk of significant individual crypto asset holdings. In addition, fair value measurement aligns the accounting required for holders of crypto assets with the accounting for entities that are subject to certain industry-specific guidance and eliminates the requirement to test those assets for impairment, thereby reducing the associated cost and complexity of applying the current guidance. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, applied retrospectively with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to early adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2024 and does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires more detailed income tax disclosures. The guidance requires entities to disclose disaggregated information about their effective tax rate reconciliation as well as expanded information on income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The disclosure requirements will be applied on a prospective basis, with the option to apply them retrospectively. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the disclosure requirements related to the new standard.\n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, FinancialInstruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (‚ÄúASU 2016-13‚Äù). ASU 2016-13 amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. Entities will no longer be permitted to consider the length of time that fair value has been less than amortized cost when evaluating when credit losses should be recognized. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023 on a modified retrospective basis which resulted in a $3.8 million increase to the opening balance of accumulated deficit, representing the cumulative allowance for credit losses for the Company‚Äôs note receivable. \n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (‚ÄúASU 2021-08‚Äù). ASU 2021-08 amends ASC 805 to require acquiring entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination. The Company adopted the new standard beginning January 1, 2023, however it did not have an effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nF-16\n\n3.Disposal of Service and Product - Related Party Transaction\n\nOn December 28, 2023, the Company and Joseph O‚ÄôDaniel (‚ÄúPurchaser‚Äù), entered into a share purchase agreement under which the Company sold its service and product segment, which included HVE ConneXions and Unified ConneXions, for $1.00 and the transfer of outstanding assets and liabilities. As a result of the share purchase agreement, the Purchaser, who served as the Company‚Äôs President, resigned effective December 28, 2023 and is no longer a related party of the Company. Through December 28, 2023, the service and product segment provided network operations center (‚ÄúNOC‚Äù) services to its customers. NOC revenues were for monthly services performed for the customer that are performed either in-house or at the customer‚Äôs site. The service and product segment also delivered data management and desktop and application virtualization solutions through hybrid cloud, cloud and on premise implementations by a reseller network. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a noncash gain of $0.7 million related to the transfer of net liabilities to the Purchaser.\n\n4.Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\n\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\n\nThe Company‚Äôs consolidated financial instruments include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and warrant liabilities. Fair value estimates of these instruments are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information. These estimates may be subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. The carrying amount of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are generally considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of those instruments. \n\nThe following tables provide a summary of the financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nFair Value| Level 1| Level 2| Level 3  \nWarrant liabilities| $| 205 | $| ‚Äî | $| ‚Äî | $| 205  \n  \nDecember 31, 2022  \n---  \nFair Value| Level 1| Level 2| Level 3  \nWarrant liabilities| $| 864 | $| 864 | $| ‚Äî | $| ‚Äî  \n  \nAt December 31, 2023, the fair value of the LDA Warrant was measured using a Black Scholes valuation model. The fair value of the warrants at December 31, 2022 issued in connection with MEOA's public offering were measured based on the listed market price of such warrants.\n\nF-17\n\nThe following table presents the activities of warrant liabilities that are measured at fair value (in thousands): \n\nWarrant liability as of January 1, 2022| $| ‚Äî  \n---|---|---  \nIssuance of MEOA warrant| 864  \nWarrant liability as of December 31, 2022| 864  \nIssuance of LDA warrant| 976  \nChange in fair value MEOA warrant| (864)  \nNoncash exercise of LDA warrant| (411)  \nChange in fair value LDA warrant| (112)  \nRetired LDA warrant| (248)  \nWarrant liability as of December 31, 2023| $| 205  \n  \nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis \n\nAs discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company accounts for its Bitcoin as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are subject to impairment losses if the fair value of its Bitcoin held decreases below their carrying value during the reporting period.\n\nThe Company's non-financial assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets are recorded at fair value when an impairment is recognized or at the time acquired in an asset acquisition or business combination measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). As discussed in Note 8 - Intangible Assets, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded impairment charges associated with acquired intangible assets and reduced the carrying amount of such assets subject to the impairment to their estimated fair value. As discussed in Note 6 - Investments and Note 7 - Certain Balance Sheet Items, at December 31, 2022, the Company recorded impairment charges associated with investments and property and equipment and reduced the carrying amount of such assets subject to the impairment to their estimated fair value.\n\n5.Notes Receivable\n\nRainmaker Promissory Note\n\nIn September 2020, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note with Rainmaker (the ‚ÄúRainmaker Note‚Äù), pursuant to which the Company loaned Rainmaker the principal amount of $3.1 million. The Rainmaker Note is secured as a registered lien under the Uniform Commercial Code and the Personal Property Security Act (Ontario) against the assets of Rainmaker and bears interest at the rate of 10% per annum. In September 2023, the Company and Rainmaker entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Rainmaker Note and the due date was extended to March 14, 2024, at which time all principal and accrued interest is due and payable. The Company has the right, at any time, to convert all or any portion of the then outstanding and unpaid Rainmaker Note and interest into at the conversion price as defined in the Rainmaker Note. \n\nOn January 1, 2023, as a result of adopting ASU 2016-13, the Company recorded an allowance for credit losses of $3.8 million and reversed accrued interest of $0.1 million. \n\nAll amounts related to the Rainmaker Note have been fully reserved. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Rainmaker Note balance, including accrued interest, was nil and $3.8 million, respectively.\n\nGryphon Promissory Note\n\nIn July 2021, the Company entered into a Promissory Note and Security Agreement with Gryphon, which was amended on August 30, 2021, September 29, 2021, and further amended on December 29, 2021 (the ‚ÄúGryphon Note‚Äù as amended). The Gryphon Note, pursuant to which the Company loaned in the aggregate to Gryphon $12.5 million, had a payment schedule whereby the principal and accrued interest shall be forgiven upon the termination of the Merger Agreement. The Gryphon Note was unsecured and bore interest at the rate of 9.5% per annum.On April 4, 2022, the Merger Agreement was terminated and $13.1 million, including interest, was forgiven and written off to other expense.As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, the outstanding Gryphon Note balance, including accrued interest, was nil.\n\nF-18\n\n6.Investments\n\nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Company\n\nIn April 2021, the Company sponsored a special purpose acquisition company (‚ÄúSPAC‚Äù), Minority Equality Opportunities Acquisition Inc. (‚ÄúMEOA‚Äù), through our wholly owned subsidiary, Minority Equality Opportunities Acquisition Sponsor, LLC (‚ÄúSPAC Sponsor‚Äù). MEOA‚Äôs purpose is to focus initially on transactions with companies that are minority owned businesses. On July 3, 2023, MEOA announced that it did not complete an initial business combination on or prior to June 30, 2023, the deadline by which it must have completed an initial business combination. As of the close of business on July 3, 2023, MEOA‚Äôs redeemable public shares were deemed cancelled and represented only the right to receive the redemption amount. MEOA instructed Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the trustee of the trust account, to liquidate the redeemable securities held in the trust account. The redemption of MEOA‚Äôs redeemable public shares for $10.4 million was completed in the third quarter of 2023. The Company received no proceeds from the trust account. \n\nOn November 30, 2022, after giving effect to the redemption of redeemable public shares of MEOA, the Company‚Äôs subsidiary owned a controlling interest of MEOA and it was consolidated. As of December 31, 2022, the Company held 3,162,500 shares of MEOA‚Äôs Class B common stock. The SPAC Sponsor agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its outstanding Class B common stock issued prior to MEOA‚Äôs initial public offering. There were no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to MEOA‚Äôs warrants, which expired worthless. On December 19, 2023, the Company‚Äôs 3,162,500 shares of MEOA‚Äôs Class B common stock were cancelled, eliminating the Company‚Äôs ownership of MEOA, and the Company recognized a $6.1 million gain related to the deconsolidation of MEOA.\n\nFilecoiner Common Stock\n\nIn October 2021, the Company purchased 1,500,000 shares of common stock of Filecoiner, a private corporation, at a price equal to $4.00 per share and was recorded at cost of $6.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment for the common stock of Filecoiner held and recorded an impairment expense of $6.0 million.\n\nFilecoiner Preferred Stock\n\nIn October 2021, the Company received 8,000 shares of Series B preferred stock of Filecoiner (‚ÄúFilecoiner Series B Preferred Stock‚Äù) for consideration for the sale of its SnapServer¬Æ product line to Filecoiner. The preferred shares have a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, do not accrue dividends nor have voting rights. Filecoiner will use 1.5% of its annual gross revenue to redeem any outstanding shares of Filecoiner Series B Preferred Stock. This amount will be paid to the holder of the Filecoiner Series B Preferred Stock within 15 days of the completion of Filecoiner's annual December 31 audited financial statements. During any 12-calendar month period, 25% of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible at the option of the holder thereof at any time into a number of shares of common stock determined by dividing (i) the original issue price by (ii) the conversion price then in effect. The initial conversion price for the Series B Preferred Stock is equal to $8.00 per share. The conversion price from time to time in effect is subject to adjustment as hereinafter defined in the Filecoiner acquisition agreement. The fair value of the Filecoiner Series B Preferred Stock was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation with the following inputs: discount rate of 40%, risk-free rate of 1.05%, cost of debt of 7.48%, together with a capital option pricing model using the following inputs: volatility of 146% and risk-free rate of 1.05%. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the Filecoiner Series B Preferred Stock held by the Company was $6.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment for the preferred stock of Filecoiner held and recorded an impairment expense of $6.4 million.\n\nSilicon Valley Technology Partners Preferred Shares\n\nIn November 2018, in connection with the divestiture of Overland, the Company received 1,879,699 SVTP Preferred Shares with a fair value of $2.1 million. The Company concluded it does not have a significant influence over the investee. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment for the SVTP Preferred Shares held and recorded an impairment expense of $2.1 million.\n\nF-19\n\n7.Certain Balance Sheet Items\n\nThe following table summarizes other current assets (in thousands): \n\nDecember 31,  \n---  \n2023| 2022  \nDigital mining hosting deposit | $| 10,000 | $| ‚Äî  \nPrepaid digital hosting services| 980 | 880  \nPrepaid services| 193 | 927  \nPrepaid insurance| 575 | 783  \nOther| 190 | 461  \nOther current assets| $| 11,938 | $| 3,051  \n  \nThe following table summarizes property and equipment, net (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,  \n---  \n2023| 2022  \nMining equipment| $| 30,122 | $| 35,550  \nAccumulated depreciation| (5,956)| (1,709)  \nSubtotal| 24,166 | 33,841  \nRight of use asset| ‚Äî | 418  \nProperty and equipment, net| $| 24,166 | $| 34,259  \n  \nDepreciation expense for property and equipment was $4.2 million and $1.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, inclusive of ROU asset amortization of $56,000 and $14,000, respectively. On December 28, 2023, the Company sold its service and product segment which included the ROU asset.\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company sold 3,336 and nil miners that were included in mining equipment, for cash proceeds of $4.5 million and nil, respectively. The Company had a loss on the sale of miners of $1.0 million and nil during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nImpairment of Mining Equipment\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, adverse changes in the business climate, including the decline in the price of Bitcoin and two vendor bankruptcy filings, indicated that an impairment triggering event occurred, and it was determined the carrying value of mining equipment exceeded its estimated fair value. In measuring fair value, the Company used a weighted probability of the income and market approaches. For the income approach, the Company used discounted cash flow analysis and for the market approach, the Company used the sales price (market price) of similar assets. The Company compared the indicated fair value to the carrying value of its mining equipment assets, and as a result of the analysis, an impairment charge of $75.9 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022. The estimated fair value of the Company‚Äôs miners is classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company did not incur any impairment charges for its mining equipment for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe following table summarizes other non-current assets (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,  \n---  \n2023| 2022  \nPrepaid digital hosting services| $| 3,402 | $| 18,514  \nPrepaid insurance and services| ‚Äî | 116  \nOther| 4 | 69  \nOther non-current assets| $| 3,406 | $| 18,699  \n  \nF-20\n\n8.Intangible Assets\n\nThe following table summarizes intangible assets, net (in thousands):\n\nDecember 31,  \n---  \n2023| 2022  \nSupplier agreements| $| 37,525 | $| 39,084  \nCapitalized development costs| 103 | 103  \nChannel partner relationships| ‚Äî | 730  \nCustomer relationships| ‚Äî | 380  \nDeveloped technology| ‚Äî | 150  \n37,628 | 40,447  \nAccumulated amortization:  \nSupplier agreements| (32,944)| (31,708)  \nCapitalized development costs| (103)| (103)  \nChannel partner relationships| ‚Äî | (720)  \nCustomer relationships| ‚Äî | (366)  \nDeveloped technology| ‚Äî | (150)  \n(33,047)| (33,047)  \nTotal finite-lived assets, net| 4,581 | 7,400  \nCarbon credits held for future use| ‚Äî | 2,077  \nTotal intangible assets, net| $| 4,581 | $| 9,477  \n  \nAmortization expense of intangible assets was $1.9 million and $26.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Estimated amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $1.5 million, $1.5 million, $1.5 million, and $0.1 million in fiscal year 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively.\n\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, a certain vendor for the Company‚Äôs carbon credits was not able to perform under terms of the agreement, which indicated that an impairment triggering event occurred for the carbon credits held for future use, and the Company determined the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value. The Company compared the indicated fair value to the carrying value of its indefinite-lived asset, and as a result of the analysis, an impairment charge of $1.7 million was recorded for the carbon credits held for future use for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, adverse changes in the business climate indicated that an impairment triggering event occurred for one supplier agreement, and the Company determined the carrying value of the finite-lived intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value. The Company compared the indicated fair value to the carrying value of its finite-lived asset, and as a result of the analysis, an impairment charge of $1.2 million was recorded for the supplier agreement for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, adverse changes in the business climate, including the decline in the price of Bitcoin and two vendor bankruptcy filings, indicated that an impairment triggering event occurred, and the Company determined the carrying value of finite-lived intangible assets exceeded its estimated fair value. In measuring fair value, the Company used a weighted income and market approach. For the income approach, the Company used discounted cash flow analysis and for the market approach, the Company used the sales price (market price) of similar assets. The Company compared the indicated fair value to the carrying value of its finite-lived assets, and as a result of the analysis, an impairment charge of $13.2 million was recorded for supplier agreements for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nF-21\n\nHertford Asset Acquisition\n\nOn July 31, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement (the ‚ÄúHertford Agreement‚Äù) with Hertford Advisors Ltd. (‚ÄúHertford‚Äù), a privately held company that provides turnkey mining solutions, to provide an exclusive right to assume all of Hertford‚Äôs rights to a number of digital asset mining hardware agreements (the ‚ÄúEquipment Agreements‚Äù). The Company has assumed and executed the first Equipment Agreement directly with the manufacturer, for the purchase of up to 60,000 new digital asset mining machines, with deliveries that commenced in January 2022. In exchange for the assignment of the Equipment Agreements for which the Company has the right, but not the obligation to complete, in 2021 the Company issued to Hertford common and preferred shares with an aggregate value of $53.8 million and was included in supplier agreements. \n\nIn November 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Hertford modifying the number of outstanding preferred shares held by Hertford (the ‚ÄúModified Hertford Agreement‚Äù). Pursuant to the Modified Hertford Agreement, the Company cancelled 36,000 Series H Preferred Shares, with a value of $15.9 million, without payment of any cash consideration, and reduced the value of the supplier agreement intangible asset by such amount.\n\n9.Convertible Debt\n\nOn April 17, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the ‚ÄúLDA Purchase Agreement‚Äù) pursuant to which the Company issued to an investor, LDA Capital Limited (the ‚ÄúInvestor‚Äù), a senior convertible promissory note having an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 million (the ‚ÄúLDA Note‚Äù), as amended April 25, 2023, and a common share purchase warrant (the ‚ÄúLDA Warrant‚Äù) to purchase up to 455,927 common shares of the Company (the ‚ÄúLDA Warrant Shares‚Äù). The Company received proceeds of approximately $0.8 million, which were net of fees associated with the transaction, on April 18, 2023 (the ‚ÄúClosing Date‚Äù). The LDA Note matures 24 months after issuance, bears interest at a rate of 7.5% per annum and is convertible into the Company's common shares (the ‚ÄúConversion Shares‚Äù), at the Investor's election, at an initial conversion price equal to the greater of (i) $2.0832 per share, or (ii) 85% of the VWAPS (as defined in the LDA Note) during the trading five days prior to delivery of a conversion notice by the Investor, subject to adjustment for certain stock splits, stock combinations and dilutive share issuances.\n\nOn August 14, 2023, in accordance with the terms of the LDA Purchase Agreement prepayment option, the Company repaid the full amount of the LDA Note, including interest and fees, in the amount of $1.3 million. As a result of the repayment, the Company redeemed from the holder of the LDA Warrant 40% of the then outstanding LDA Warrant, or 182,371 LDA Warrant Shares. At December 31, 2023, the balance of the LDA Note was nil. The Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $63,000 which is included in the consolidated statement of operations in interest income and other expense, net.\n\nThe LDA Warrant is exercisable at an initial exercise price of $3.29 per share and expires three years from the date of issuance or earlier if the closing of a Fundamental Transaction occurs (defined as merger or consolidation, any sale of substantially all of the Company‚Äôs assets, any tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to which common shareholders can tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property, as well as any reclassification of common shares into other securities, cash or property). On the date that is six months from the date of issuance of the LDA Warrant, the exercise price will be adjusted to the lower of (i) $3.29, and (ii) a price equal to 110% of the average of the VWAPS (as defined in the LDA Warrant) of the Company's common shares over five days of trading preceding such date. Additionally, the exercise price of the LDA Warrant is subject to adjustment for certain stock splits, stock combinations and dilutive share issuances. Pursuant to the terms of the LDA Purchase Agreement, the Company will reserve for issuance 200% of the maximum aggregate number of common shares as are issuable upon repayment or conversion in full of the LDA Note and exercise in full of the LDA Warrant at any time. In October 2023, the Company adjusted the LDA Warrant exercise price from $3.29 to $1.342 pursuant to the terms in the LDA Purchase Agreement.\n\nOn December 29, 2023, the Company issued 123,806 common shares with a value of $0.4 million for a cashless exercise of 200,000 LDA Warrant Shares.\n\nThe LDA Warrant contains a contingent put option. In the event of a Fundamental Transaction, the Investor may, at the Investor‚Äôs option, require the Company to purchase the LDA Warrant for an amount of cash equal to the Black Scholes value of the remaining unexercised portion of the warrant on the date of consummation of such Fundamental Transaction. The Company has recorded the warrant as a liability and will adjust the warrant liability to fair value each reporting period until settled. \n\nF-22\n\nOn April 17, 2023, upon issuance of the LDA Note and LDA Warrant, which are accounted for as freestanding financial instruments, the Company determined that the aggregate fair value of $2.0 million for the instruments issued exceeds the net proceeds received under the transaction. Accordingly, the excess of the fair value over the proceeds received of $1.0 million was recognized as interest expense. The initial fair value of the LDA Warrant was measured using a Monte Carlo valuation model and at December 31, 2023 using a Black Scholes valuation model with the following assumptions, respectively:\n\nApril 17,2023| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nCommon share price| $| 2.98 | $| 3.47  \nExpected volatility| 120.0 | %| 120.0 | %  \nRisk-free interest rate| 3.8 | %| 4.2 | %  \n  \n10.Preferred Shares\n\nSeries H Preferred Shares\n\nOn October 1, 2021, the Company filed articles of amendment to create a series of preferred shares, being, an unlimited number of Series H Preferred Shares and to provide for the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching thereto. The Series H Preferred Shares are convertible provided (and only if and to the extent) that prior shareholder approval of the issuance of all Sphere 3D common shares issuable upon conversion of the Series H Preferred Shares has been obtained in accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, at any time from time to time, at the option of the holder thereof, into 142.857 Sphere 3D common shares for every Series H Preferred Share. Each holder of the Series H Preferred Shares, may, subject to prior shareholder approval, convert all or any part of the Series H Preferred Shares provided that after such conversion the common shares issuable, together with all the common shares held by the shareholder in the aggregate would not exceed 9.99% of the total number of outstanding common shares of the Company. Each Series H Preferred Share has a stated value of $1,000. The Series H Preferred Shares are non-voting and do not accrue dividends. These features include, in the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, deemed liquidation or any other distribution of the assets of the Company among its shareholders for the purpose of winding-up its affairs, the Series H Preferred Shares shall entitle each of the holders thereof to receive an amount equal to the Series H subscription price per Series H Preferred Share, as defined in the agreement, to be paid before any amount is paid or any assets of the Company are distributed to the holders of its common shares.\n\nIn November 2022, the Company entered into the Modified Hertford Agreement. Pursuant to the Modified Hertford Agreement, the Company cancelled 36,000 Series H Preferred Shares, with a value of $15.9 million, without payment of any cash consideration, and reduced the value of the supplier agreement intangible asset by such amount. The Modified Hertford Agreement also provides for certain resale restrictions applicable to the common shares that are issuable upon the conversion of the remaining Series H Preferred Shares during the two-year period ending on December 31, 2024, which are different from the restrictions contained in the Hertford Agreement, as well, commencing January 1, 2023 and terminating on December 31, 2023, holders of Series H Preferred Shares are permitted to (a) convert Series H Preferred Shares in an aggregate amount up to or equal to 3.0% of the aggregate number of Series H Preferred Shares outstanding on the first day of each such month and (b) sell the resulting number (and no greater number) of such converted common shares within such month. Commencing January 1, 2024 and terminating on December 31, 2024, holders of Series H Preferred Shares are permitted to (a) convert Series H Preferred Shares in an aggregate amount up to or equal to 10.0% of the aggregate number of Series H Preferred Shares outstanding on the first day of each such month and (b) sell the resulting number (and no greater number) of such converted common shares within such month.\n\nIn August 2023, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Agreement (the ‚ÄúHertford Amendment‚Äù) with Hertford Advisors Ltd. and certain other parties listed in the Hertford Amendment (together, the ‚ÄúHertford Group‚Äù), which amends and restates in its entirety the purchase agreement between the Company and Hertford Advisors Ltd. dated July 31, 2021, as modified by the amendment to such agreement dated November 7, 2022 (together, the ‚ÄúOriginal Hertford Agreement‚Äù). As an inducement to enter into the Hertford Amendment, the Company issued to Hertford 1,376 Series H Preferred Shares and 800,000 warrants with an aggregate fair value of $1.0 million. Pursuant to the Hertford Amendment, Hertford exchanged 14,980 Series H Preferred Shares for Series H Preferred Shares held by other persons (the ‚ÄúExchanged Series H Preferred Shares‚Äù).\n\nF-23\n\nThe offer and sale of the Series H Preferred Shares and the Warrants have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States in the absence of an effective registration statement or exemption from the registration requirements, and in each case in compliance with applicable state securities laws.\n\nIn August 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the ‚ÄúPurchase Agreement‚Äù) pursuant to which the Company issued to two investors a total of 13,764 of the Company‚Äôs Series H Preferred Shares and a total of 1,966,293 common share purchase warrants (the ‚ÄúWarrants‚Äù), each of which entitled the holder to purchase one common share of the Company (the ‚ÄúWarrant Shares‚Äù). Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company received gross proceeds of $3.0 million. The Company issued a total of 1,377 Series H Preferred Shares and 196,629 warrants as a finder‚Äôs fee for the transaction with an aggregate fair value of $0.5 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company will reserve for issuance the maximum aggregate number of common shares that are issuable upon exercise in full of the Warrants at any time.\n\nThe Warrants issued in connection with the Hertford Amendment and the Purchase Agreement are exercisable beginning February 12, 2024 and February 23, 2024, respectively, at an initial exercise price of $2.75 per share and have a term of three years from the date of issuance. The exercise price of the Warrants are subject to adjustment for certain stock splits, stock combinations and dilutive share issuances.\n\nIn accordance with the authoritative guidance for distinguishing liabilities from equity, the Company has determined that its Series H preferred shares carry certain redemption features beyond the control of the Company. Accordingly, the Series H Preferred Shares are presented as temporary equity. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued 4,714,560 common shares for the conversion of 33,002 Series H Preferred Shares. For the year ended December 31, 2022, no Series H Preferred Shares were converted.\n\n11.Share Capital\n\nOn June 28, 2023, the Company filed an Articles of Amendment to effect a share consolidation (also known as a reverse stock split) of its issued and outstanding common shares on a one-for-seven basis. The share consolidation became effective on June 28, 2023. All share and per share amounts have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the share consolidation.\n\nIn April 2022, the Company issued 192,857 unregistered common shares, with a fair value of $1.7 million, to Bluesphere Ventures Inc. for the right to acquire up to 1,040,000 carbon credits.\n\nIn March 2022, in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Company issued into escrow 121,428 common shares with a fair value of $1.2 million.

At December 31, 2023, the Company had the following outstanding warrants to purchase common shares: \n\nDate issued| Contractual life (years)| Exercise price| Number outstanding| Expiration  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nJuly 2021| 3| $28.00| 285,716 | December 22, 2024  \nAugust 2021| 3| $45.50| 370,787 | August 25, 2024  \nAugust 2021| 3| $52.50| 370,787 | August 25, 2024  \nSeptember 2021| 5| $66.50| 1,614,299 | September 8, 2026  \nOctober 2021| 3| $42.00| 121,429 | October 1, 2024  \nFebruary 2022| 5| $28.00| 14,286 | February 7, 2027  \nFebruary 2022| 5| $35.00| 14,286 | February 7, 2027  \nFebruary 2022| 5| $42.00| 14,286 | February 7, 2027  \nApril 2023| 3| $1.342| 73,556 | April 17, 2026  \nAugust 2023| 3| $2.75| 800,000 | August 11, 2026  \nAugust 2023| 3| $2.75| 2,162,922 | August 23, 2026  \n5,842,354  \n  \n12.Equity Incentive Plans\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, a total of 820,585 common shares are authorized for issuance with respect to awards primarily granted under the 2015 Plan. In addition, the share limit will automatically increase on the first trading day in January of each calendar year during the term of the 2015 Plan by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 10% of the total number of common shares issued and outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (ii) such number of common shares as may be established by the Board. The 2015 Plan authorizes the board of directors to grant stock and options awards to directors, employees and consultants. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately 366,415 share-based awards available for future grant. \n\nThe Company‚Äôs Employee Stock Purchase Plan (‚ÄúESPP‚Äù) authorizes the purchase of up to 5,357 common shares by employees under the plan. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no offering periods available to employees. \n\nStock Options\n\nThe following table summarizes option activity:\n\nSharesSubject to Options| Weighted-AverageExercisePrice| Weighted-AverageRemainingContractualTerm (years)| AggregateIntrinsicValue(in thousands)  \n---|---|---|---  \nOptions outstanding ‚Äî January 1, 2022| 95 | $| 3,960.32  \nGranted| 389,509 | $| 6.16  \nExercised| ‚Äî | $| ‚Äî  \nForfeited| ‚Äî | $| ‚Äî  \nOptions outstanding ‚Äî December 31, 2022| 389,604 | $| 7.07  \nGranted| 250,000 | $| 2.43  \nExercised| (229,999)| $| 2.42  \nForfeited| (14,364)| $| 20.36  \nOptions outstanding ‚Äî December 31, 2023| 395,241 | $| 6.34 | 4.4| $| 222  \nVested and expected to vest ‚Äî December 31, 2023| 395,241 | $| 6.34 | 4.4| $| 222  \nExercisable ‚Äî December 31, 2023| 325,599 | $| 5.39 | 4.5| $| 222  \n  \nF-25\n\nThe weighted average grant date fair values of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.58 per share and $4.92 per share, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $0.1 million and nil, respectively. Cash received from stock option exercises for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $0.6 million and nil, respectively.\n\nThe fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility was based on the Company‚Äôs historical share price. The risk-free interest rate is determined based upon a constant maturity U.S. Treasury security with a contractual life approximating the expected term of the option. The expected term of options granted is based on term of the award. Option awards can be granted for a maximum term of up to ten years. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model were as follows:\n\nYear Ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023| 2022  \nExpected volatility| 81.8-84.0%| 121.7-124.4%  \nExpected term (in years)| 0.5| 3.9  \nRisk-free interest rate| 5.27-5.52%| 2.71-3.91%  \nDividend yield| ‚Äî| ‚Äî  \n  \nRestricted Stock Units\n\nThe following table summarizes RSU activity:\n\nNumber ofShares| Weighted AverageGrant Date Fair Value  \n---|---  \nOutstanding ‚Äî January 1, 2022| 8,571 | $| 24.22  \nGranted| 551,849 | $| 14.70  \nVested and released| (435,238)| $| 16.59  \nForfeited| ‚Äî | $| ‚Äî  \nOutstanding ‚Äî December 31, 2022| 125,182 | $| 8.89  \nGranted| 454,697 | $| 2.89  \nVested and released| (499,997)| $| 3.45  \nForfeited| (20,953)| $| 6.78  \nOutstanding ‚Äî December 31, 2023| 58,929 | $| 9.51  \n  \nThe estimated fair value of RSUs was based on the market value of the Company‚Äôs common shares on the date of grant. RSUs typically vest over a period of one year to three years from the original date of grant. The total grant date fair value of RSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $1.7 million and $7.2 million, respectively. The fair value of RSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $0.7 million and $2.5 million, respectively. \n\nRestricted Stock Awards\n\nThe Company granted restricted stock awards (‚ÄúRSA‚Äù) to certain employees and consultants in lieu of cash payment for services performed. The estimated fair value of the RSAs was based on the market value of the Company‚Äôs common shares on the date of grant. The RSAs were fully vested on the date of grant. The fair value of the RSAs vested during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $0.2 million and nil, respectively.\n\nF-26\n\nThe following table summarizes RSA activity:\n\nNumber ofShares| Weighted AverageGrant Date Fair Value  \n---|---  \nOutstanding ‚Äî January 1, 2022| ‚Äî | $| ‚Äî  \nGranted| ‚Äî | $| ‚Äî  \nVested| ‚Äî | $| ‚Äî  \nOutstanding ‚Äî December 31, 2022| ‚Äî | $| ‚Äî  \nGranted | 89,654 | $| 2.39  \nVested| (89,654)| $| 2.39  \nOutstanding ‚Äî December 31, 2023| ‚Äî | $| ‚Äî  \n  \nShare-Based Compensation Expense \n\nThe Company recorded the following compensation expense related to its share-based compensation awards (in thousands):\n\nYear Ended December 31,  \n---  \n2023| 2022  \nSales and marketing| $| 103 | $| ‚Äî  \nGeneral and administrative| 2,327 | 8,459  \nTotal share-based compensation expense| $| 2,430 | $| 8,459  \n  \nTotal unrecognized estimated compensation cost by type of award and the weighted-average remaining requisite service period over which such expense is expected to be recognized (in thousands, unless otherwise noted):\n\nDecember 31, 2023  \n---  \nUnrecognized Expense| Remaining Weighted-Average Recognition Period (years)  \nRSUs| $| 412 | 1.3  \nStock options| $| 179 | 1.3  \n  \n13.Net Loss per Share \n\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Preferred shares, common share outstanding purchase warrants, and outstanding options and RSUs are considered common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share when net income is reported and their effect is dilutive. For all periods presented, there is no difference in the number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted shares outstanding due to the Company‚Äôs net loss position. \n\nAnti-dilutive common share equivalents excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share were as follows:\n\nDecember 31,  \n---  \n2023| 2022  \nPreferred shares| 6,216,422 | 8,571,429  \nCommon share purchase warrants| 5,842,354 | 2,826,220  \nOptions and RSUs outstanding| 454,170 | 514,788  \n  \nF-27\n\n14.Income Taxes\n\nThe Company is subject to taxation in Canada and also in certain foreign tax jurisdictions. The Company's tax returns for calendar year 2016 and forward are subject to examination by the Canadian tax authorities. The Company's tax returns for fiscal year 2019 and forward are subject to examination by the U.S. federal and state tax authorities.\n\nThe Company recognizes the impact of an uncertain income tax position on its income tax return at the largest amount that is ‚Äúmore likely than not‚Äù to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, there were no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that, within the next 12 months, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may remain unchanged. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income taxes.

Changes in the liability for deferred revenue associated with extended warranties and service contracts were as follows (in thousands):\n\nDeferredRevenue  \n---  \nLiability at January 1, 2022| $| 214  \nRevenue recognized during the period| (190)  \nChange in liability for warranties issued during the period| 115  \nLiability at December 31, 2022| 139  \nRevenue recognized during the period| (121)  \nChange in liability for warranties issued during the period| 163  \nLiabilities sold| (181)  \nLiability at December 31, 2023| $| ‚Äî  \n  \nF-32\n\nLitigation\n\nThe Company is, from time to time, subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company cannot predict the final outcome of such proceedings. Where appropriate, the Company vigorously defends such claims, lawsuits and proceedings. Paid expenses related to the defense of such claims are recorded by the Company as incurred and paid. On the basis of current information, the Company does not believe there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss, if any, will result from any claims, lawsuits and proceedings to which the Company is subject to either individually, or in the aggregate.\n\nOn April 7, 2023, the Company filed a suit against Gryphon in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Company alleges, among other things, that Gryphon materially breached its obligations to the Company, both its contractual duties under the Gryphon MSA dated August 19, 2021, and its fiduciary duties, including as a custodian of the Company‚Äôs assets. On August 22, 2023, Gryphon asserted counterclaims alleging breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence in managing its computer systems, and defamation. On November 7, 2023, Gryphon voluntarily dismissed its defamation claim. Gryphon has amended its complaint several times, and on December 14, 2023, added a second breach of contract claim predicated on another alleged breach of the Gryphon MSA. On February 2, 2024, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the second breach of contract claim, the negligence claim, and the breach of the implied covenant claim for failure to state a claim. On February 16, 2024, the court so-ordered a stipulation agreed to by the parties dismissing the second breach of contract claim, the negligence claim, and the breach of the implied covenant claim with prejudice. The so-ordered stipulation expressly preserves the Company‚Äôs ability to seek the recovery of its costs and attorney‚Äôs fees incurred in connection with the dismissed claims. The Company disputes the allegations against it and intends to vigorously defend itself and to vigorously pursue its claims against Gryphon. At this preliminary stage, the Company believes that Gryphon‚Äôs claims lack merit; however, because this litigation is still at this early stage, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the magnitude of such an outcome, if any.\n\n16.Segment Information\n\nThe Company has two operating segments, (1) Digital Mining and (2) Service and Product.

Business\nOverview\nSphere 3D was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) on May 2, 2007 as T.B. Mining Ventures Inc. On March 24, 2015, we\ncompleted a short-form amalgamation with a wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with the short-form amalgamation, we changed our name to ‚ÄúSphere 3D\nCorp.‚Äù Any reference to the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù, ‚ÄúSphere 3D‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, or similar terms refers to Sphere 3D Corp. and its subsidiaries. In December 2014, we\ncompleted the acquisition of Overland Storage, Inc. (‚ÄúOverland‚Äù) to grow our business in the containerization and virtualization technologies along with data\nmanagement products that enabled workload-optimized solutions. In November 2018, we sold our Overland business. In January 2022, we commenced\noperations of our digital mining operation and are dedicated to becoming a leading carbon-neutral Bitcoin mining company. We are establishing an enterprise-\nscale mining operation through procurement of next-generation mining equipment and partnering with experienced service providers.\n1\nDigital assets and blockchain\nBitcoin is a digital asset issued by and transmitted through an open source protocol maintained by a peer-to-peer network of decentralized user nodes.\nThis network hosts a public transaction ledger blockchain where the digital assets and their corresponding transactions are recorded. The digital assets are stored\nin individual wallets with public addresses and a private key that controls access. The blockchain is updated without a single owner or operator of the network.\nNew digital assets are generated and mined rewarding users after transactions are verified in the blockchain.\nDigital assets and their corresponding markets emulate foreign exchange markets of fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, where they can be exchanged\nto said fiat currencies trading exchanges. In addition to these exchanges, additional trading markets for digital assets exist, such as derivative markets.\nSince the nature of digital assets is such that it exists solely in electronic form, they are exposed to risks similar to that of any data held solely in electronic\nform such as power failure, data corruption, cyber security attacks, protocol breaches, and user error, among others. Similar to data centers, these risks put the\ndigital assets subject to the aforementioned threats which might not necessarily affect a physical fiat currency. In addition, blockchain relies on open source\ndevelopers to maintain the digital asset protocols. Blockchain as such may be subject to design changes, governance disputes such as ‚Äúforked‚Äù protocols, and\nother risks associated with open source software.\nDigital currencies serve multiple purposes - a medium of exchange, store of value or unit of account. Examples of digital currencies include: bitcoin,\nbitcoin cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Digital currencies are decentralized currencies that facilitate instant transfers. Transactions occur on an open source\nplatform using peer-to-peer direct technology with no single owner. Blockchain is a public transaction ledger where transactions occur, are recorded and tracked,\nhowever not owned nor managed by one single entity. Blockchain, accessible and open to all, contains records of all existing and historical transactions. All\naccounts on the blockchain have a unique public key and is secured with a private key that is only known to the individual. The combination of private and\npublic keys results in a secure digital ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù which results in a strong control of ownership.\nWe believe cryptocurrencies have many advantages over traditional, physical fiat currencies, including immediate settlement, fraud deterrent as they are\nunable to be duplicated or counterfeited, lower fees, mass accessibility, decentralized nature, identity theft prevention, physical loss prevention, no counterparty\nrisk, no intermediary facilitation, no arduous exchange rate implications and a strong confirmation transaction process.\nService and product\nIn addition to digital mining, we provide network operations center (‚ÄúNOC‚Äù) services to our customers. NOC revenues are for monthly services\nperformed for the customer that are performed either in-house or at the customer‚Äôs site. We also deliver data management and desktop and application\nvirtualization solutions through hybrid cloud, cloud and on premise implementations by a reseller network. We achieve this through a combination of\ncontainerized applications, virtual desktops, virtual storage and physical hyper-converged platforms. Our products allow organizations to deploy a combination\nof public, private or hybrid cloud strategies while backing them up with the latest storage solutions. Our brands include HVE ConneXions (‚ÄúHVE‚Äù) and Unified\nConneXions (‚ÄúUCX‚Äù).\nInvestment in Special Purpose Acquisition Company\nIn April 2021, we sponsored a special purpose acquisition company (‚ÄúSPAC‚Äù), Minority Equality Opportunities Acquisition Inc. (‚ÄúMEOA‚Äù), through our\nwholly owned subsidiary, Minority Equality Opportunities Acquisition Sponsor, LLC (‚ÄúSPAC Sponsor‚Äù). MEOA‚Äôs purpose is to focus initially on transactions\nwith companies that are minority owned businesses. In April 2021, SPAC Sponsor paid $25,000 of deferred offering costs on behalf of MEOA in exchange for\n2,875,000 shares of MEOA‚Äôs Class B common stock (the ‚ÄúFounder Shares‚Äù). On August 30, 2021, MEOA consummated its initial public offering (the ‚ÄúIPO‚Äù)\nand issued units which were comprised of one share of Class A common stock and one redeemable warrant. Also in August 2021, and simultaneously with the\nconsummation of the IPO, SPAC Sponsor participated in the private sale of an aggregate of 5,395,000 Warrants (the ‚ÄúPrivate Placement Warrants‚Äù) at a purchase\nprice of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant. The SPAC Sponsor paid $5.4 million to MEOA,\n2\nwhich included $1.0 million from an investor participating in MEOA Sponsor. The Private Placement Warrants are not transferable, assignable or saleable until\n30 days after MEOA completes a business combination. On October 18, 2021, the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the Class A common\nstock and warrants are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols ‚ÄúMEOA‚Äù and ‚ÄúMEOAW,‚Äù respectively.\nIn August 2022, MEOA entered into a business combination agreement with MEOA Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned\nsubsidiary of MEOA (‚ÄúMerger Sub‚Äù), and Digerati Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (‚ÄúDigerati‚Äù), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or\nwaiver of certain conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Digerati (the ‚ÄúDigerati Merger‚Äù), with Digerati surviving the Digerati Merger\nas a wholly owned subsidiary of MEOA, and with Digerati‚Äôs equity holders receiving shares of MEOA common stock.\nIn November 2022, MEOA held a special meeting of stockholders (the ‚ÄúMEOA Meeting‚Äù). At the MEOA Meeting, MEOA‚Äôs stockholders approved an\namendment (the ‚ÄúExtension Amendment‚Äù) to MEOA‚Äôs amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which MEOA must consummate\nits initial business combination from November 30, 2022 to May 30, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by MEOA‚Äôs board of directors. In connection with\nthe MEOA Meeting, the holders of MEOA‚Äôs shares of its Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in\nthe trust account. After giving effect to the redemption of MEOA‚Äôs public shares, on November 30, 2022, the Company owned a controlling interest of MEOA\nand since such time MEOA has been recorded on a consolidated basis.\nSPAC Sponsor, along with MEOA‚Äôs initial stockholders, MEOA‚Äôs executive officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with MEOA,\npursuant to which we have agreed to (i) waive our redemption rights with respect to our founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of\nthe initial business combination; (ii) waive our redemption rights with respect to our founder shares and public shares in connection with a stockholder vote to\napprove an amendment to the certificate of incorporation: (A) to modify the substance or timing of MEOA‚Äôs obligation to redeem 100% of the public shares if\nMEOA does not complete an initial business combination within the combination period; or (B) with respect to any other material provision relating to\nstockholders‚Äô rights or pre-initial business combination activity; and (iii) waive our rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to our\nfounder shares if MEOA fails to complete an initial business combination within the Combination Period.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we hold an aggregate of 3,162,500 shares of MEOA‚Äôs Class B common stock.\nSeries H Preferred Shares\nOn November 7, 2022, we entered into an agreement with Hertford modifying the number of outstanding Series H Preferred Shares held by Hertford (the\n‚ÄúModified Hertford Agreement‚Äù). Pursuant to the Modified Hertford Agreement, we cancelled 36,000 Series H Preferred Shares, representing 37.5% of the\noutstanding Series H Preferred Shares payable to Hertford under the Hertford Agreement, without payment of any cash consideration. Each Series H Preferred\nShare is convertible into 1,000 common shares. Hertford will retain 60,000 Series H Preferred Shares, which are non-voting and do not accrue dividends. At our\n2022 Annual General Meeting, we received shareholder approval to convert the remaining 60,000 Series H Preferred Shares, subject to the terms and conditions\ncontained in our Articles of Incorporation. The Modified Hertford Agreement also provides for certain resale restrictions applicable to the common shares that\nare issuable upon the conversion of the remaining Series H Preferred Shares during the two-year period ending on December 31, 2024, which are different from\nthe restrictions contained in the Hertford Agreement, as well, commencing January 1, 2023 and terminating on December 31, 2023, holders of Series H\nPreferred Shares are permitted to (a) convert Series H Preferred Shares in an aggregate amount up to or equal to 3.0% of the aggregate number of Series H\nPreferred Shares outstanding on the first day of each such month and (b) sell the resulting number (and no greater number) of such converted common shares\nwithin such month. Commencing January 1, 2024 and terminating on December 31, 2024, holders of Series H Preferred Shares are permitted to (a) convert\nSeries H Preferred Shares in an aggregate amount up to or equal to 10.0% of the aggregate number of Series H Preferred Shares outstanding on the first day of\neach such month and (b) sell the resulting number (and no greater number) of such converted common shares within such month.\n3\nTerminated Merger Agreement\nOn June 3, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ‚ÄúMerger Agreement‚Äù) with Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. (‚ÄúGryphon‚Äù), a\nprivately held company in the cryptocurrency space dedicated to helping bring digital assets onto the clean energy grid. Gryphon‚Äôs Bitcoin mining operation has\na zero-carbon footprint and their long-term strategy is to be the first vertically integrated crypto miner with a wholly owned, one hundred percent renewable\nenergy supply.\nOn February 15, 2022, and subsequently on March 7, 2022, primarily as a result of comments we received from the SEC relating to an amendment to the\nregistration statement on Form F-4 we filed with the SEC on January 5, 2022 in connection with our proposed merger with Gryphon, we retained two\nindependent investment banks to review the terms of the proposed Gryphon merger transaction. The nature of the review was to provide an independent analysis\nas to whether the consideration to be paid by us in the proposed merger was fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view and to assess the inputs to the\nfinancial models that were used to test such fairness.\nOn April 4, 2022, the Merger Agreement was terminated. The Merger Agreement, among other matters, provided that, upon termination of the Merger\nAgreement, we would forgive all amounts outstanding under the outstanding Promissory Note and Security Agreement as amended with Gryphon (the ‚ÄúGryphon\nNote‚Äù), and release to Gryphon 850,000 common shares previously deposited into an escrow account for the benefit of Gryphon. As a result of the termination\nof the Merger Agreement in the second quarter of 2022, we forgave the Gryphon Note which had a balance of $13.1 million and released the 850,000 common\nshares, with a fair value of $1.2 million, held in escrow to Gryphon. We will continue our relationship with Gryphon through the Gryphon Master Services\nAgreement entered into in 2021.\nNasdaq Listing\nOn July 25, 2022, we received a notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (‚ÄúNasdaq‚Äù) stating that the\nbid price of our common stock for the last 30 consecutive trading days had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share required for continued listing under\nListing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the ‚ÄúListing Rule‚Äù). We had a period of 180 calendar days, or until January 23, 2023, to regain compliance with the Listing Rule.\nOn January 24, 2023, we received notification from Nasdaq indicating that we will have an additional 180-day grace period, or until July 24, 2023, to\nregain compliance with the Listing Rule's $1.00 minimum bid requirement. The notification indicated that we did not regain compliance during the initial 180-\nday grace period provided under the Listing Rule. In accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we are eligible for the additional grace period\nbecause we meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on the Nasdaq\nCapital Market with the exception of the bid price requirement, and our written notice to Nasdaq of our intentions to cure the deficiency by effecting a reverse\nstock split, if necessary.\nIf we do not regain compliance by July 24, 2023, or if we fail to satisfy another Nasdaq requirement for continued listing, Nasdaq staff could provide\nnotice that our common shares will become subject to delisting. In such event, Nasdaq rules permit us to appeal any delisting determination to a Nasdaq\nHearings Panel. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to maintain our Nasdaq listing. We intend to actively monitor the closing bid price\nfor our common shares and will consider available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the Listing Rule.\nDisposal of SnapServer¬Æ Product Line\nIn October 2021, Sphere 3D and Filecoiner entered into an acquisition agreement under which our wholly-owned subsidiary, HVE ConneXions (‚ÄúHVE‚Äù)\nsold the assets, including intellectual property, associated with our SnapServer¬Æ product line to Filecoiner, in exchange for 8,000 shares of Series B preferred\nstock of Filecoiner (‚ÄúFilecoiner Series B Preferred Stock‚Äù) with a fair value equal to $6.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a gain\non the sale of the assets of $5.0 million and is included in interest income and other, net on the consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, we recognized an impairment for the preferred stock of Filecoiner held and recorded an impairment expense of $6.4 million.\n4\nService and Product\nService\nCustomer service and support are key elements of our strategy and critical components of our commitment in making enterprise-class support and\nservices available to companies of all sizes.

This appliance utilizes a software defined datacenter\n(SDD) approach with solutions that work for Tier 2 all flash array front-end storage or rapid backup/recovery business continuity solutions integrated\nwith software technologies like Veeam and Nakivo.\nProduction\nA significant number of our components and finished products are manufactured or assembled, in whole or in part, by a limited number of third parties.\nFor certain products, we control the design process internally and then outsource the manufacturing and assembly in order to achieve lower production costs.\nWe purchase disk drives and chassis from outside suppliers. We carefully select suppliers based on their ability to provide quality parts and components\nwhich meet technical specifications and volume requirements. We actively monitor these suppliers but we are subject to substantial risks associated with the\nperformance of our suppliers. For certain components, we qualify only a single source, which magnifies the risk of shortages and may decrease our ability to\nnegotiate with that supplier. For a more detailed description of risks related to suppliers, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nSales and Distribution\nOur reseller channel includes systems integrators, VARs and DMRs. Our resellers may package our products as part of complete application and desktop\nvirtualization solutions data processing systems or with other storage devices to deliver complete enterprise information technology infrastructure solutions. Our\nresellers also recommend our products as replacement solutions when systems are upgraded, or bundle our products with storage management software specific\nto the end user‚Äôs system. We support the reseller channel through our dedicated sales representatives, engineers and technical support organizations.\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret and copyright laws, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect the proprietary aspects of\nour products and services. Although every effort is made to protect Sphere 3D‚Äôs intellectual property, these legal protections may only afford limited protection.\nWe may continue to file for patents regarding various aspects of our products, services and delivery method at a later date depending on the costs and\ntiming associated with such filings. We may make investments to further strengthen our copyright protection going forward, although no assurances can be given\nthat it will be successful in such patent and trademark protection endeavors. We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees,\nconsultants, and partners with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements and non-competition agreements (when applicable)\nand by restricting access to our proprietary information. Due to rapid technological change, we believe that establishing and maintaining an industry and\ntechnology advantage in factors such as the expertise and technological and creative skills of our personnel, as well as new services and enhancements to our\nexisting services, are more important to our company‚Äôs business and profitability than other available legal protections.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that\nwe regard as proprietary. The laws of many countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. or Canada. Litigation may be\nnecessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of\nothers or to defend against claims of infringement. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be\nadequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar services or products. Any failure by us to adequately protect our intellectual property\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors under the section Risks Related to\nIntellectual Property.\n6\nCompetitive Conditions\nWe believe that our products are unique and innovative and afford us various advantages in the market place; however, the market for information\ntechnology is highly competitive. Competitors vary in size from small start-ups to large multi-national corporations which may have substantially greater\nfinancial, research and development, and marketing resources. Competitive factors in these markets include performance, functionality, scalability, availability,\ninteroperability, connectivity, time to market enhancements, and total cost of ownership. Barriers to entry vary from low, such as those in traditional disk-based\nbackup products, to high, in virtualization software. The markets for all of our products are characterized by price competition and as such we may face price\npressure for our products. For a more detailed description of competitive and other risks related to our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nGovernmental Regulations\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enforced by various regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. For a detailed description of the material effects of government regulations on our business, see ‚ÄúOur international operations\nare important to our business and involve unique risks related to financial, political, and economic conditions‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe are subject to laws, regulations and\nsimilar requirements, changes to which may adversely affect our business and operations‚Äù see Item 1A. Risk Factors‚ÄîRisks Related to Our Business.\nEmployees\nWe had 27 and 25 full-time employees at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our Company involves a high degree of risk. Each of the following risk factors in evaluating our business and prospects as well as an\ninvestment in our Company should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and\nuncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our\nbusiness and financial results could be harmed and the trading price of our common shares could decline.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur total revenue is substantially dependent on the prices of digital assets and volume of transactions conducted on our platform. If such price or\nvolume declines, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe generate the majority of our total revenue from digital mining. As such, any declines in the volume of digital asset transactions, the price of digital\nassets, or market liquidity for digital assets generally may result in lower total revenue. The price of digital assets and associated demand for buying, selling, and\ntrading digital assets have historically been subject to significant volatility. For instance, in 2022, the value of certain digital assets, including Bitcoin,\nexperienced steep decreases in value. The price and trading volume of any digital asset is subject to significant uncertainty and volatility, depending on a number\nof factors, including:\n‚Ä¢ market conditions of, and overall sentiment towards, digital assets;\n‚Ä¢ changes in liquidity, market-making volume, and trading activities;\n‚Ä¢ trading activities on other digital platforms worldwide, many of which may be unregulated, and may include manipulative activities;\n‚Ä¢ investment and trading activities of highly active retail and institutional users, speculators, miners, and investors;\n‚Ä¢ the speed and rate at which digital assets are able to gain adoption as a medium of exchange, utility, store of value, consumptive asset, security\ninstrument, or other financial assets worldwide, if at all;\n7\n‚Ä¢ decreased user and investor confidence in digital assets and digital platforms;\n‚Ä¢ negative publicity and events relating to the digital economy;\n‚Ä¢ unpredictable social media coverage or ‚Äútrending‚Äù of, or other rumors and market speculation regarding digital assets;\n‚Ä¢ the ability for digital assets to meet user and investor demands;\n‚Ä¢ the functionality and utility of digital assets and their associated ecosystems and networks, including digital assets designed for use in various\napplications;\n‚Ä¢ increased competition from other payment services or other digital assets that exhibit better speed, security, scalability, or other characteristics;\n‚Ä¢ regulatory or legislative changes and updates affecting the digital economy;\n‚Ä¢ the maintenance, troubleshooting, and development of the blockchain networks underlying digital assets, including by miners, validators, and\ndevelopers worldwide;\n‚Ä¢ the ability for digital networks to attract and retain miners or validators to secure and confirm transactions accurately and efficiently;\n‚Ä¢ ongoing technological viability and security of digital assets and their associated smart contracts, applications and networks, including vulnerabilities\nagainst hacks and scalability;\n‚Ä¢ fees and speed associated with processing digital asset transactions, including on the underlying blockchain networks and on digital platforms;\n‚Ä¢ financial strength of market participants;\n‚Ä¢ the availability and cost of funding and capital;\n‚Ä¢ the liquidity of digital platforms;\n‚Ä¢ interruptions in service from or failures of major digital platforms;\n‚Ä¢ availability of an active derivatives market for various digital assets;\n‚Ä¢ availability of banking and payment services to support digital-related projects; and\n‚Ä¢ level of interest rates and inflation.\nThere is no assurance that any supported digital asset will maintain its value or that there will be meaningful levels of trading activities. In the event that\nthe price of digital assets or the demand for trading digital assets decline, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur operating results have and will significantly fluctuate due to the highly volatile nature of digital assets.\nOur operating results are dependent on digital assets and the broader cryptoeconomy. Due to the highly volatile nature of the cryptoeconomy and the\nprices of digital assets, our operating results have, and will continue to, fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in accordance with market sentiments and\nmovements in the broader cryptoeconomy. Our operating results will continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are\nunpredictable and in certain instances are outside of our control, including:\n‚Ä¢ our dependence on offerings that are dependent on crypto asset trading activity, including trading volume and the prevailing trading prices for crypto\nassets, whose trading prices and volume can be highly volatile;\n‚Ä¢ adding crypto assets to, or removing from, our platform;\n‚Ä¢ market conditions of, and overall sentiment towards, the cryptoeconomy;\n8\n‚Ä¢ system failure, outages, or interruptions, including with respect to our crypto platform and third-party crypto networks; and\n‚Ä¢ inaccessibility of our platform due to our or third-party actions.\nAs a result of these factors, it is difficult for us to forecast growth trends accurately and our business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate,\nparticularly in the short term. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and the cryptoeconomy, period-to-period comparisons of our operating\nresults may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Quarterly and annual expenses reflected in our\nfinancial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. Our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the\nexpectations of securities analysts and investors. As a result, the trading price of our common stock may increase or decrease significantly.\nThe future development and growth of crypto is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to predict and evaluate. If digital assets do not grow as\nwe expect, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nDigital assets built on blockchain technology were only introduced in 2008. Digital assets are designed for different purposes. Bitcoin, for instance, was\ndesigned to serve as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, while Ethereum was designed to be a smart contract and decentralized application platform. Many\nother crypto networks, ranging from cloud computing to tokenized securities networks, have only recently been established. The further growth and\ndevelopment of any crypto assets and their underlying networks and other cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the creation, transfer, and usage of\ncrypto assets represent a new and evolving paradigm that is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, including:\n‚Ä¢ many crypto networks have limited operating histories, have not been validated in production, and are still in the process of developing and making\nsignificant decisions that will affect the design, supply, issuance, functionality, and governance of their respective crypto assets and underlying\nblockchain networks, any of which could adversely affect their respective crypto assets;\n‚Ä¢ many crypto networks are in the process of implementing software upgrades and other changes to their protocols, which could introduce bugs, security\nrisks, or adversely affect the respective crypto networks;\n‚Ä¢ several large networks, including Ethereum, are developing new features to address fundamental speed, scalability, and energy usage issues. If these\nissues are not successfully addressed, or are unable to receive widespread adoption, it could adversely affect the underlying digital assets;\n‚Ä¢ security issues, bugs, and software errors have been identified with many digital assets and their underlying blockchain networks, some of which have\nbeen exploited by malicious actors. There are also inherent security weaknesses in some digital assets, such as when creators of certain crypto networks\nuse procedures that could allow hackers to counterfeit tokens. Any weaknesses identified with a digital asset could adversely affect its price, security,\nliquidity, and adoption. If a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the\nactions of the computers) obtains a majority of the compute or staking power on a crypto network, as has happened in the past, it may be able to\nmanipulate transactions, which could cause financial losses to holders, damage the network‚Äôs reputation and security, and adversely affect its value;\n‚Ä¢ the development of new technologies for mining, such as improved application-specific integrated circuits (commonly referred to as ASICs), or\nchanges in industry patterns, such as the consolidation of mining power in a small number of large mining farms, could reduce the security of\nblockchain networks, lead to increased liquid supply of digital assets, and reduce a digital asset‚Äôs price and attractiveness;\n‚Ä¢ if rewards and transaction fees for miners or validators on any particular crypto network are not sufficiently high to attract and retain miners, a crypto\nnetwork‚Äôs security and speed may be adversely affected, increasing the likelihood of a malicious attack;\n9\n‚Ä¢ many digital assets have concentrated ownership or an ‚Äúadmin key,‚Äù allowing a small group of holders to have significant unilateral control and\ninfluence over key decisions related to their crypto networks, such as governance decisions and protocol changes, as well as the market price of such\ndigital assets;\n‚Ä¢ the governance of many decentralized blockchain networks is by voluntary consensus and open competition, and many developers are not directly\ncompensated for their contributions. As a result, there may be a lack of consensus or clarity on the governance of any particular crypto network, a lack\nof incentives for developers to maintain or develop the network, and other unforeseen issues, any of which could result in unexpected or undesirable\nerrors, bugs, or changes, or stymie such network‚Äôs utility and ability to respond to challenges and grow;\n‚Ä¢ algonomic units to U.S. dollar may fail causing devaluation in specific cryptocurrencies which may impact the market perception of safer currencies;\nand\n‚Ä¢ many crypto networks are in the early stages of developing partnerships and collaborations, all of which may not succeed and adversely affect the\nusability and adoption of the respective crypto assets.\nVarious other technical issues have also been uncovered from time to time that resulted in disabled functionalities, exposure of certain users‚Äô personal\ninformation, theft of users‚Äô assets, and other negative consequences, and which required resolution with the attention and efforts of their global miner, user, and\ndevelopment communities. If any such risks or other risks materialize, and in particular if they are not resolved, the development and growth of crypto may be\nsignificantly affected and, as a result, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCryptocurrency mining activities are energy-intensive, which may restrict the geographic locations of mining machines and have a negative\nenvironmental impact. Government regulators may potentially restrict the ability of electricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations,\nsuch as ours.\nMining cryptocurrency requires massive amounts of electrical power, and electricity costs are expected to account for a significant portion of our overall\ncosts. The availability and cost of electricity will restrict the geographic locations of our mining activities. Any shortage of electricity supply or increase in\nelectricity costs in any location where we plan to operate may negatively impact the viability and the expected economic return for cryptocurrency mining\nactivities in that location.\nFurther, our business model can only be successful and our mining operations can only be profitable if the costs, including electrical power costs,\nassociated with cryptocurrency mining are lower than the price of the cryptocurrency itself. As a result, any equipment we deploy can only be successful if we\ncan obtain access to sufficient electrical power on a cost-effective basis through hosting arrangements with mining data centers. Our deployment of new mining\nequipment requires us to find sites where that is the case. Even if our electrical power costs do not increase, significant fluctuations in, and any prolonged\nperiods of, low cryptocurrency prices may also cause our electrical supply to no longer be cost-effective.\nFurthermore, if cryptocurrency mining becomes more widespread, government scrutiny related to restrictions on cryptocurrency mining facilities and\ntheir energy consumption may significantly increase. The considerable consumption of electricity by mining operators may also have a negative environmental\nimpact, including contribution to climate change, which could set the public opinion against allowing the use of electricity for cryptocurrency mining activities.\nThis, in turn, could lead to governmental measures restricting or prohibiting the use of electricity for cryptocurrency mining activities. Any such development in\nthe jurisdictions where we plan to operate could increase our compliance burdens and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nWe rely on hosting arrangements to conduct our business, and the availability of such hosting arrangements is uncertain and competitive and may be\naffected by changes in regulation in one or more countries.\nIf we are unable to successfully enter into definitive hosting agreements with mining data centers on favorable terms or those counterparties fail to\nperform their obligations under such agreements, we may be forced to look for alternative mining data centers to host its mining equipment.\n10\nIn May 2021, China‚Äôs State Council issued a statement signaling its intent to restrict cryptocurrency mining and trading activities, resulting in provincial\ngovernments taking proactive measurements to prohibit cryptocurrency mining. On September 24, 2021, China‚Äôs central bank and its National Development and\nReform Commission issued a nation-wide ban on cryptocurrency mining and declaring all financial transactions involving cryptocurrencies illegal. As a result,\nmining data centers previously operating in China have been forced to shut down and owners of crypto mining equipment located in China have been attempting\nto relocate the equipment to mining data centers in other jurisdictions, with a particular focus on locations within the United States. Combined with the increase\nin the price of many cryptocurrencies in 2021, the influx of crypto miners from China has created conditions of great demand for mining data centers and limited\nsupply. Due to these conditions, there is no assurance that we will be able to procure alternative hosting agreements on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at\nall.\nSignificant competition for suitable mining data centers is expected to continue, and other government regulators, including local permitting officials,\nmay potentially restrict the ability of potential mining data centers to begin or continue operations in certain locations. They can also restrict the ability of\nelectricity suppliers to provide electricity to mining operations in times of electricity shortage, or may otherwise potentially restrict or prohibit the provision of\nelectricity to mining operations.\nWe may be affected by price fluctuations in the wholesale and retail power markets.\nMarket prices for power, generation capacity and ancillary services, are unpredictable. Depending upon the effectiveness of any price risk management\nactivity undertaken by us, including but not limited to attempts to secure hosting services contracts at fixed fees, an increase in market prices for power,\ngeneration capacity, and ancillary services may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. Long- and short-term power\nprices may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n‚Ä¢ increases and decreases in generation capacity;\n‚Ä¢ changes in power transmission or fuel transportation capacity constraints or inefficiencies;\n‚Ä¢ demand response/mandatory curtailments;\n‚Ä¢ volatile weather conditions, particularly unusually hot or mild summers or unusually cold or warm winters;\n‚Ä¢ technological shifts resulting in changes in the demand for power or in patterns of power usage, including the potential development of demand-side\nmanagement tools, expansion and technological advancements in power storage capability and the development of new fuels or new technologies for\nthe production or storage of power;\n‚Ä¢ federal and state power, market and environmental regulation and legislation; and\n‚Ä¢ changes in capacity prices and capacity markets.\nIf we are unable to secure consistent power supply at prices or on terms acceptable to it, it would have a material adverse effect on our business,\nprospects, financial condition, and operating results.\nAs cryptocurrencies may be determined to be investment securities, we may inadvertently violate the Investment Company Act of 1940 and incur large\nlosses as a result and potentially be required to register as an investment company or terminate operations and we may incur third-party liabilities.\nWe believe that we are not engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities, and we do not hold ourself out as being engaged in\nthose activities. However, under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ‚ÄúInvestment Company Act‚Äù), a company may be deemed an investment company\nunder section 3(a)(1)(C) thereof if the value of its investment securities is more than 40% of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items)\non an unconsolidated basis.\n11\nAs a result of our investments and our mining activities, including investments in which we do not have a controlling interest, the investment securities\nwe hold could exceed 40% of our total assets, exclusive of cash items and, accordingly, we could determine that we have become an inadvertent investment\ncompany. The cryptocurrency that we own, acquire or mine may be deemed an investment security by the SEC, although we do not believe any of the\ncryptocurrency we own, acquire or mine are securities. An inadvertent investment company can avoid being classified as an investment company if it can rely\non one of the exclusions under the Investment Company Act. One such exclusion, Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act, allows an inadvertent\ninvestment company a grace period of one year from the earlier of (a) the date on which an issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of\nthe issuer‚Äôs total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis and (b) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment securities\nhaving a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer‚Äôs total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. As of the\ndate of this proxy statement/prospectus, we do not believe we are an inadvertent investment company. We may take actions to cause the investment securities\nheld by us to be less than 40% of our total assets, which may include acquiring assets with our cash and cryptocurrency on hand or liquidating our investment\nsecurities or cryptocurrency or seeking a no-action letter from the SEC if we are unable to acquire sufficient assets or liquidate sufficient investment securities in\na timely manner.\nAs the Rule 3a-2 exception is available to a company no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusion were available to us, we\nwould have to keep within the 40% limit for at least three years after we cease being an inadvertent investment company. This may limit our ability to make\ncertain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on our earnings. In any event, we do not intend to become an\ninvestment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities.\nClassification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act requires registration with the SEC. If an investment company fails to\nregister, it would have to stop doing almost all business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time consuming and restrictive and would\nrequire a restructuring of our operations, and we would be very constrained in the kind of business we could do as a registered investment company. Further, we\nwould become subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio composition, and would\nneed to file reports under the Investment Company Act regime. The cost of such compliance would result in us incurring substantial additional expenses, and the\nfailure to register if required would have a materially adverse impact to conduct our operations.\nIf regulatory changes or interpretations of our activities require its registration as a money services business under the regulations promulgated by The\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, we may be required to register and comply with such\nregulations. If regulatory changes or interpretations of our activities require the licensing or other registration of us as a money transmitter (or\nequivalent designation) under state law in any state in which we operate, we may be required to seek licensure or otherwise register and comply with\nsuch state law. In the event of any such requirement, to the extent we decide to continue, the required registrations, licensure and regulatory\ncompliance steps may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses to us. We may also decide to cease its operations. Any termination of certain\noperations in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to investors.\nTo the extent that our activities cause us to be deemed a money service business under the regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement\nNetwork of the U.S. Treasury Department (‚ÄúFinCEN‚Äù) under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, we may be required to comply with FinCEN\nregulations, including those that would mandate us to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records.\n12\nTo the extent that our activities cause us to be deemed a money transmitter or equivalent designation under state law in any state in which we operate, we\nmay be required to seek a license or otherwise register with a state regulator and comply with state regulations that may include the implementation of anti-\nmoney laundering programs, maintenance of certain records and other operational requirements. Currently, the New York Department of Financial Services has\nfinalized its ‚ÄúBitLicense‚Äù framework for businesses that conduct ‚Äúvirtual currency business activity.‚Äù We will continue to monitor for developments in New York\nlegislation, guidance and regulations.\nSuch additional federal or state regulatory obligations may cause us to incur extraordinary expenses, possibly affecting our business in a material and\nadverse manner. Furthermore, we and our service providers may not be capable of complying with certain federal or state regulatory obligations applicable to\nmoney service businesses and money transmitters. If we are deemed to be subject to and determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and\nregistration requirements, we may act to dissolve and liquidate us. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in us.\nThere is no one unifying principle governing the regulatory status of cryptocurrency nor whether cryptocurrency is a security in each context in which\nit is viewed. Regulatory changes or actions in one or more countries may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of digital assets, such\nas cryptocurrencies, in a manner that adversely affects our business, prospects or operations.\nAs cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently, with certain governments\ndeeming cryptocurrencies illegal, and others allowing their use and trade without restriction. In some jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., digital assets, like\ncryptocurrencies, are subject to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements.\nCryptocurrencies have been the source of much regulatory consternation, resulting in differing definitional outcomes without a single unifying statement.\nCryptocurrency is viewed differently by different regulatory and standards setting organizations globally as well as in the United States on the federal and state\nlevels. For example, the Financial Action Task Force (‚ÄúFATF‚Äù) and the Internal Revenue Service (‚ÄúIRS‚Äù) consider a cryptocurrency as currency or an asset or\nproperty. Further, the IRS applies general tax principles that apply to property transactions to transactions involving virtual currency.\nIf regulatory changes or interpretations require the regulation of cryptocurrency under the securities laws of the United States or elsewhere, including the\nSecurities Act of 1933, the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act or similar laws of other jurisdictions and interpretations by the SEC, the CFTC, the IRS, Department\nof Treasury or other agencies or authorities, we may be required to register and comply with such regulations, including at a state or local level. To the extent\nthat we decide to continue operations, the required registrations and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary expense or burdens to us. We may\nalso decide to cease certain operations and change our business model. Any disruption of our operations in response to the changed regulatory circumstances\nmay be at a time that is disadvantageous to us.\nCurrent and future legislation and SEC rule making and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may\nimpact the manner in which cryptocurrencies are viewed or treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, cryptocurrencies may not be excluded\nfrom the definition of ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù by SEC rule making or interpretation requiring registration of all transactions unless another exemption is available, including\ntransacting in cryptocurrency among owners and require registration of trading platforms as ‚Äúexchanges‚Äù.\nWe cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of cryptocurrencies under the law. If we fail to comply with such\nadditional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations or be subjected to fines, penalties and other governmental\naction. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue its business model at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on its business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we plan to hold or expect to acquire for\nour own account.\n13\nOur business is dependent on a small number of digital asset mining equipment suppliers.\nOur business is dependent upon digital asset mining equipment suppliers providing an adequate supply of new generation digital asset mining machines at\neconomical prices to customers intending to purchase our hosting and other solutions. The growth in our business is directly related to increased demand for\nhosting services and cryptocurrency which is dependent in large part on the availability of new generation mining machines offered for sale at a price conducive\nto profitable digital asset mining, as well as the trading price of cryptocurrency. The market price and availability of new mining machines fluctuates with the\nprice of cryptocurrencies and can be volatile. In addition, as more companies seek to enter the mining industry, the demand for machines may outpace supply\nand create mining machine equipment shortages. There are no assurances that cryptocurrency mining equipment suppliers will be able to keep pace with any\nsurge in demand for mining equipment. Further, manufacturing mining machine purchase contracts are not favorable to purchasers and we may have little or no\nrecourse in the event a mining machine manufacturer defaults on its mining machine delivery commitments. If we and our customers are not able to obtain a\nsufficient number of digital asset mining machines at favorable prices, our growth expectations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will be\nnegatively impacted.\nChanges in tariffs or import restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEquipment necessary for digital asset mining is almost entirely manufactured outside of the United States. There is currently significant uncertainty about\nthe future relationship between the United States and various other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada, and Mexico, with respect to trade\npolicies, treaties, tariffs and customs duties, and taxes. For example, since 2019, the U.S. government has implemented significant changes to U.S. trade policy\nwith respect to China. These tariffs have subjected certain digital asset mining equipment manufactured overseas to additional import duties of up to 25%. The\namount of the additional tariffs and the products subject to them has changed numerous times based on action by the U.S. government. These tariffs have\nincreased costs of digital asset mining equipment, and new or additional tariffs or other restrictions on the import of equipment necessary for digital asset mining\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMining machines rely on components and raw materials that may be subject to price fluctuations or shortages, including ASIC chips that have been\nsubject to a significant shortage.\nIn order to build and sustain our self-mining operations we will depend on third parties to provide us with ASIC chips and other critical components for\nour mining equipment, which may be subject to price fluctuations or shortages. For example, the ASIC chip is the key component of a mining machine as it\ndetermines the efficiency of the device. The production of ASIC chips typically requires highly sophisticated silicon wafers, which currently only a small\nnumber of fabrication facilities, or wafer foundries, in the world are capable of producing. We believe that the previous microchip shortage that the entire\nindustry experienced lead to price fluctuations and disruption in the supply of key miner components. Specifically, the ASIC chips have recently been subject to\na significant price increases and shortages.\nThere is also a risk that a manufacturer or seller of ASIC chips or other necessary mining equipment may adjust the prices according cryptocurrency\nprices or otherwise, so the cost of new machines could become unpredictable and extremely high. As a result, at times, we may be forced to obtain mining\nmachines and other hardware at premium prices, to the extent they are even available. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nprospects, financial condition, and operating results.\n14\nThe further development and acceptance of digital asset networks and other digital assets, which represent a new and rapidly changing industry, are\nsubject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of digital asset systems may\nadversely affect an investment in us.\nThe use of cryptocurrencies to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services and complete transactions, is part of a new and rapidly evolving\nindustry that employs cryptocurrency assets, based upon a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. Large-scale acceptance of\ncryptocurrency as a means of payment has not, and may never, occur. The growth of this industry is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, and the slowing or\nstopping of the development or acceptance of developing protocols may occur unpredictably. The factors include, but are not limited to:\n‚Ä¢ continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies as a medium to exchange;\n‚Ä¢ governmental and quasi-governmental regulation of cryptocurrencies and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of\ncryptocurrency systems;\n‚Ä¢ changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;\n‚Ä¢ the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the network;\n‚Ä¢ the increased consolidation of contributors to the blockchain through mining pools;\n‚Ä¢ the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat currencies;\n‚Ä¢ the use of the networks supporting cryptocurrencies for developing smart contracts and distributed applications;\n‚Ä¢ general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies; and\n‚Ä¢ negative market sentiment and perception of cryptocurrencies.\nThe outcome of these factors could have negative effects on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business strategy at all, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations as well as potentially negative effect on the value of any cryptocurrency that we\nmine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, which would harm investors.\nBanks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that engage in cryptocurrency-related\nactivities or that accept cryptocurrency as payment, including financial institutions of investors in our common shares.\nA number of companies that engage in cryptocurrency-related activities have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that are willing to provide\nthem with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with cryptocurrencies may have had and\nmay continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions in response to government action, particularly in\nChina, where regulatory response to cryptocurrencies has been to exclude their use for ordinary consumer transactions within China. We also may be unable to\nobtain or maintain these services for our business. The difficulty that many businesses that provide cryptocurrency-related activities have and may continue to\nhave in finding banks and financial institutions willing to provide them services may be decreasing the usefulness of cryptocurrency as a payment system and\nharming public perception of cryptocurrency, and could decrease their usefulness and harm their public perception in the future.\nWe face risks of Internet disruptions, which could have an adverse effect on the price of cryptocurrencies.\nA disruption of the Internet may affect the use of cryptocurrencies. Generally, cryptocurrency and our business of mining cryptocurrency is dependent\nupon the Internet. A significant disruption in Internet connectivity could disrupt a currency‚Äôs network operations until the disruption is resolved and have an\nadverse effect on the price of cryptocurrencies and our ability to mine cryptocurrencies.\n15\nThe impact of geopolitical and economic events on the supply and demand for cryptocurrency is uncertain.\nGeopolitical crises may motivate large-scale purchases of cryptocurrencies, which could increase the price of cryptocurrencies rapidly. This may increase\nthe likelihood of a subsequent price decrease as crisis-driven purchasing behavior dissipates, adversely affecting the value of our inventory following such\ndownward adjustment. Such risks are similar to the risks of purchasing commodities in uncertain times, such as the risk of purchasing, holding or selling gold.\nAlternatively, as an emerging asset class with limited acceptance as a payment system or commodity, global crises and general economic downturns may\ndiscourage investment in cryptocurrency as investors focus their investment on less volatile asset classes as a means of hedging their investment risk.\nAs an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, cryptocurrency, which is relatively new, is subject to supply and demand\nforces. How such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events is largely uncertain but could be harmful to us. Political or economic crises may\nmotivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of cryptocurrency either globally or locally. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue\nas a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the\nvalue of any cryptocurrency that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nWe may not be able to compete with other companies, some of whom have greater resources and experience.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against present or future competitors. We do not have the resources to compete with larger providers of\nsimilar services at this time. The cryptocurrency industry has attracted various high-profile and well-established operators, some of which have substantially\ngreater liquidity and financial resources than we do. With the limited resources we have available, we may experience great difficulties in expanding and\nimproving our network of computers to remain competitive. Competition from existing and future competitors, particularly those that have access to\ncompetitively-priced energy, could result in our inability to secure acquisitions and partnerships that we may need to expand our business in the future. This\ncompetition from other entities with greater resources, experience and reputations may result in our failure to maintain or expand our business, as we may never\nbe able to successfully execute our business plan. If we are unable to expand and remain competitive, our business could be negatively affected.\nThe mining data centers at which we maintain our mining equipment may experience damages, including damages that are not covered by insurance.\nThe mining data centers at which we maintain our mining equipment are, and any future mining data centers at which we maintain our mining equipment\nwill be, subject to a variety of risks relating to physical condition and operation, including:\n‚Ä¢ the presence of construction or repair defects or other structural or building damage;\n‚Ä¢ any non-compliance with or liabilities under applicable environmental, health or safety regulations or requirements or building permit requirements;\n‚Ä¢ any damage resulting from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and windstorms; and\n‚Ä¢ claims by employees and others for injuries sustained at our properties.\nFor example, the mining data centers at which we maintain our mining equipment could be rendered inoperable, temporarily or permanently, as a result of\na fire or other natural disaster or by a terrorist or other attack on the facilities where our mining equipment is located. Although we have multiple sites in an\neffort to mitigate this risk, these and other measures we take to protect against these risks may not be sufficient. Any property insurance we obtain in the future\nmay not be adequate to cover any losses we suffer as a result of any of these events. In the event of an uninsured loss, including a loss in excess of insured limits,\nat any of the mining data centers at which we maintain our mining equipment, such mining data centers may not be adequately repaired in a timely manner or at\nall and we may lose some or all of the future revenues anticipated to be derived from our equipment located at such mining data centers.\n16\nAcceptance and/or widespread use of cryptocurrency is uncertain.\nCurrently, there is a relatively limited use of any cryptocurrency in the retail and commercial marketplace. Banks and other established financial\ninstitutions may refuse to process funds for cryptocurrency transactions, process wire transfers to or from cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency-related\ncompanies or service providers, or maintain accounts for persons or entities transacting in cryptocurrency. Conversely, a significant portion of cryptocurrency\ndemand is generated by investors seeking a long-term store of value or speculators seeking to profit from the short- or long-term holding of the asset. Price\nvolatility undermines cryptocurrency‚Äôs role as a medium of exchange, as retailers are much less likely to accept it as a form of payment.\nThe relative lack of acceptance of cryptocurrency in the retail and commercial marketplace, or a reduction of such use, limits the ability of end users to\nuse them to pay for goods and services. Such lack of acceptance or decline in acceptances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern or to pursue our strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of\ncryptocurrency we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nThe decentralized nature of cryptocurrency systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect our business.\nThe decentralized nature of the governance of cryptocurrency systems may lead to ineffective decision making that slows development or prevents a\nnetwork from overcoming emergent obstacles. Governance of many cryptocurrency systems is by voluntary consensus and open competition with no clear\nleadership structure or authority. To the extent lack of clarity in corporate governance of the blockchain leads to ineffective decision making that slows\ndevelopment and growth of cryptocurrency network protocols, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe lack of regulation of digital asset exchanges which Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are traded on, may expose us to the effects of negative\npublicity resulting from fraudulent actors in the cryptocurrency space, and can adversely affect an investment in us.\nThe digital asset exchanges on which Bitcoin is traded are relatively new and largely unregulated. Many digital asset exchanges do not provide the public\nwith significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices, or regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace\nmay lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, such digital asset exchanges, including prominent exchanges handling a significant portion of\nthe volume of digital asset trading. During 2022, a number of companies in the crypto industry declared bankruptcy, including Celsius Network LLC\n(‚ÄúCelsius‚Äù), Voyager Digital Ltd., BlockFi Lending LLC, and FTX Trading Ltd. (‚ÄúFTX‚Äù). In June 2022, Celsius began pausing all withdrawals and transfers\nbetween accounts on its platform, and in July 2022, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Further, in November 2022, FTX, one of the major\ncryptocurrency exchanges, also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Such bankruptcies have contributed, at least in part, to further price volatility in most crypto\nassets, a loss of confidence in the participants of the digital asset ecosystem and negative publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly, and other participants\nand entities in the digital asset industry have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected. These events have also negatively impacted the liquidity of the\ndigital assets markets as certain entities affiliated with FTX engaged in significant trading activity. As a result of these events, many digital asset markets,\nincluding the market for Bitcoin, have experienced increased price volatility. The Bitcoin ecosystem may continue to be negatively impacted and experience\nlong term volatility if public confidence decreases. Further, we have been directly and indrectly impacted by the above recent bankruptcies in the crypto asset\nspace, and may in the future be directly or indirectly impacted by any future bankrupcties in the cyrpto asset space.\nThese events are continuing to develop and it is not possible to predict, at this time, every risk that they may pose to us, our service providers, or the\ndigital asset industry as a whole. A perceived lack of stability in the digital asset exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of digital asset\nexchanges due to business failure, hackers or malware, government-mandated regulation, or fraud, may reduce confidence in digital asset networks and result in\ngreater volatility in cryptocurrency values. These potential consequences of a digital asset exchange‚Äôs failure could adversely affect an investment in us.\n17\nIt may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell or use cryptocurrencies, participate in blockchains or utilize similar cryptocurrency\nassets in one or more countries, the ruling of which would adversely affect us.\nAs cryptocurrency has grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrency; certain\ngovernments have deemed them illegal, and others have allowed their use and trade without restriction, while in some jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., subject\nto extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements. Until recently, little or no regulatory attention has been directed\ntoward cryptocurrency by U.S. federal and state governments, foreign governments and self-regulatory agencies. As cryptocurrency has grown in popularity and\nin market size, the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress and certain U.S. agencies have begun to examine cryptocurrency in more detail.\nOne or more countries, including but not limited to China and Russia, which have taken harsh regulatory action in the past, may take regulatory actions in\nthe future that could severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell or use these cryptocurrency assets or to exchange for fiat currency. In many nations,\nparticularly in China and Russia, it is illegal to accept payment in cryptocurrencies for consumer transactions and banking institutions are barred from accepting\ndeposits of cryptocurrency. Such restrictions may adversely affect us as the large-scale use of cryptocurrency as a means of exchange is presently confined to\ncertain regions globally. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our strategy at all,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrency that we mine or otherwise\nacquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nInvestors may not have the same protections that exist for traditional stock exchanges.\nTraditional stock exchanges have listing requirements and vet issuers, requiring them to be subjected to rigorous listing standards and rules, and monitor\ninvestors transacting on such platform for fraud and other improprieties. Depending on a ledger-based platform‚Äôs controls and the other policies of the ledger-\nbased platform on which a given cryptocurrency trades, such cryptocurrency may not benefit from the protections afforded to traditional stock exchanges. For\nledger-based platforms that do not provide sufficient protections, there is a risk of fraud and manipulation. These factors may decrease liquidity or volume of a\ngiven ledger-based platform or of the cryptocurrency industry in general or may otherwise increase volatility of investment securities or other assets trading on a\nledger-based system. Such potential decreased liquidity or volume, or increase in volatility may adversely affect us, and could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrency that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account and harm\ninvestors.\nOur operations, investment strategies and profitability may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in cryptocurrency.\nWe compete with other users and/or companies that are mining cryptocurrency and other potential financial vehicles, including securities backed by or\nlinked to cryptocurrency through entities similar to us. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond our control, may make it more attractive to\ninvest in other financial vehicles, or to invest in cryptocurrency directly. The emergence of other financial vehicles and exchange-traded funds have been\nscrutinized by regulators and such scrutiny and the negative impressions or conclusions resulting from such scrutiny could be applicable to us and impact our\nability to successfully pursue our strategy or operate at all, or to establish or maintain a public market for our securities. Such circumstances could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nprospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrency that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, and harm investors.\nCryptocurrency may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access.\nThere is a risk that some or all of any cryptocurrency that we own could be lost or stolen. Cryptocurrencies are stored in cryptocurrency sites commonly\nreferred to as ‚Äúwallets‚Äù by holders of cryptocurrencies which may be accessed to exchange a holder‚Äôs cryptocurrency assets. Access to our cryptocurrency assets\ncould also be restricted by cybercrime\n18\n(such as a denial of service attack) against a service at which we maintain a hosted hot wallet. A hot wallet refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is connected\nto the Internet. Generally, hot wallets are easier to set up and access than wallets in cold storage, but they are also more susceptible to hackers and other technical\nvulnerabilities. Cold storage refers to any cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the Internet. Cold storage is generally more secure than hot storage, but\nis not ideal for quick or regular transactions and we may experience lag time in our ability to respond to market fluctuations in the price of our cryptocurrency\nassets. We expect to hold all of our cryptocurrency in a combination of insured institutional custody services and multisignature cold storage wallets, and\nmaintain secure backups to reduce the risk of malfeasance, but the risk of loss of our cryptocurrency assets cannot be wholly eliminated. Any restrictions on\naccess to our hot wallet accounts due to cybercrime or other reasons could limit our ability to convert cryptocurrency to cash, potentially resulting in liquidity\nissues.\nHackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure cryptocurrency. As we increase in size, we may become a more appealing\ntarget of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other security threats. Any of these events may adversely affect our operations and, consequently, our investments\nand profitability. The loss or destruction of a private key required to access our digital wallets may be irreversible and we may be denied access for all time to\nour cryptocurrency holdings or the holdings of others held in those compromised wallets. Our loss of access to our private keys or a data loss relating to our\ndigital wallets could adversely affect our investments and assets.\nCryptocurrencies are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in which\nthey are held, which wallet‚Äôs public key or address is reflected in the network‚Äôs public blockchain. To the extent such private keys are lost, destroyed or\notherwise compromised, we will be unable to access our cryptocurrency rewards and such private keys may not be capable of being restored by any network.\nAny loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our cryptocurrency could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going\nconcern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any\ncryptocurrency that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nIncorrect or fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions may be irreversible.\nCryptocurrency transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly\nexecuted or fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions could adversely affect our investments and assets. Cryptocurrency transactions are not, from an\nadministrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the cryptocurrencies from the transaction. Once a\ntransaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to a blockchain, an incorrect transfer of a cryptocurrency or a theft thereof generally will not\nbe reversible and we may not have sufficient recourse to recover our losses from any such transfer or theft. It is possible that, through computer or human error,\nor through theft or criminal action, our cryptocurrency rewards could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled\naccounts. Further, at this time, there is no specifically enumerated U.S. or foreign governmental, regulatory, investigative or prosecutorial authority or\nmechanism through which to bring an action or complaint regarding missing or stolen cryptocurrency. In the event of a loss, we would be reliant on existing\nprivate investigative entities to investigate any such loss of our cryptocurrency assets. To the extent that we are unable to recover our losses from such action,\nerror or theft, such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations of and potentially the value of any cryptocurrency that we mine or otherwise acquire or\nhold for our own account.\nOur interactions with a blockchain may expose us to specially designated nationals or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did\nnot contemplate distributed ledger technology.\nThe Office of Financial Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury (‚ÄúOFAC‚Äù) requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct\nbusiness with persons named on its specially designated nationals list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions, we may\ninadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC‚Äôs specially designated nationals list. Our policy prohibits any\ntransactions with such specially designated national individuals, but we may not be adequately capable of determining\n19\nthe ultimate identity of the individual with whom we transact with respect to selling cryptocurrency assets. Moreover, federal law prohibits any U.S. person from\nknowingly or unknowingly possessing any visual depiction commonly known as child pornography. Recent media reports have suggested that persons have\nembedded such depictions on one or more blockchains. Because our business requires us to download and retain one or more blockchains to effectuate our\nongoing business, it is possible that such digital ledgers contain prohibited depictions without our knowledge or consent. To the extent government enforcement\nauthorities literally enforce these and other laws and regulations that are impacted by decentralized distributed ledger technology, we may be subject to\ninvestigation, administrative or court proceedings, and monetary fines and penalties, which could harm our reputation.\nCryptocurrencies face significant obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times.\nCryptocurrencies face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times, and attempts to increase the volume of\ntransactions may not be effective. Scaling cryptocurrencies is essential to the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, which\nwidespread acceptance is necessary to the continued growth and development of our business. Many cryptocurrency networks face significant scaling\nchallenges. For example, cryptocurrencies are limited with respect to how many transactions can occur per second. Participants in the cryptocurrency ecosystem\ndebate potential approaches to increasing the average number of transactions per second that the network can handle and have implemented mechanisms or are\nresearching ways to increase scale, such as increasing the allowable sizes of blocks, and therefore the number of transactions per block, and sharding (a\nhorizontal partition of data in a database or search engine), which would not require every single transaction to be included in every single miner‚Äôs or validator‚Äôs\nblock. However, there is no guarantee that any of the mechanisms in place or being explored for increasing the scale of settlement of cryptocurrency transactions\nwill be effective, or how long they will take to become effective, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe price of cryptocurrency may be affected by the sale of cryptocurrency by other vehicles investing in cryptocurrency or tracking cryptocurrency\nmarkets.\nThe mathematical protocols under which many cryptocurrencies are mined permit the creation of a limited, predetermined amount of currency, while\nothers have no limit established on total supply. To the extent that other vehicles investing in cryptocurrency or tracking cryptocurrency markets form and come\nto represent a significant proportion of the demand for a cryptocurrency, large redemptions of the securities of those vehicles and the subsequent sale of such\ncryptocurrency by such vehicles could negatively affect the price and value of the cryptocurrency inventory we hold. Such events could have a material adverse\neffect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or\noperations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrency that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nThere are risks related to technological obsolescence, the vulnerability of the global supply chain to cryptocurrency hardware disruption, and difficulty\nin obtaining new hardware which may have a negative effect on our business.\nOur mining operations can only be successful and ultimately profitable if the costs of mining cryptocurrency, including hardware and electricity costs,\nassociated with mining cryptocurrency are lower than the price of cryptocurrency. As our mining facility operates, our miners experience ordinary wear and tear,\nand may also face more significant malfunctions caused by a number of extraneous factors beyond our control. The physical degradation of our miners will\nrequire us to, over time, replace those miners which are no longer functional. Additionally, as the technology evolves, we may be required to acquire newer\nmodels of miners to remain competitive in the market.\nAlso, because we expect to depreciate all new miners, our reported operating results will be negatively affected. Further, the global supply chain for\ncryptocurrency miners is presently heavily dependent on China. Should disruptions to the China-based global supply chain for cryptocurrency hardware occur,\nwe may not be able to obtain adequate replacement parts for existing miners or to obtain additional miners from the manufacturer on a timely basis. Such events\ncould have a material adverse effect on our ability to pursue our new strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n20\nWe may not adequately respond to price fluctuations and rapidly changing technology, which may negatively affect our business.\nCompetitive conditions within the cryptocurrency industry require that we use sophisticated technology in the operation of our business. The industry for\nblockchain technology is characterized by rapid technological changes, new product introductions, enhancements and evolving industry standards. New\ntechnologies, techniques or products could emerge that might offer better performance than the software and other technologies we currently utilize, and we may\nhave to manage transitions to these new technologies to remain competitive. We may not be successful, generally or relative to our competitors in the\ncryptocurrency industry, in timely implementing new technology into our systems, or doing so in a cost-effective manner. As a result, our business and\noperations may suffer.\nThe reward for mining cryptocurrency in the future may decrease, and the value of cryptocurrency may not adjust to compensate us for the reduction\nin the rewards we receive from our mining efforts.\nThere is no guarantee that price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies will compensate for the reduction in mining reward. If a corresponding and proportionate\nincrease in the trading price of a cryptocurrency or a proportionate decrease in mining difficulty does not follow the decrease in rewards, the revenue we earn\nfrom our cryptocurrency mining operations could see a corresponding decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe value of cryptocurrency may be subject to pricing risk and has historically been subject to wide swings.\nCryptocurrency market prices, which have historically been volatile and are impacted by a variety of factors (including those discussed below), are\ndetermined primarily using data from various exchanges, over-the-counter markets and derivative platforms. Furthermore, such prices may be subject to factors\nsuch as those that impact commodities, more so than business activities, which could be subjected to additional influence from fraudulent or illegitimate actors,\nreal or perceived scarcity, and political, economic, regulatory or other conditions. Pricing may be the result of, and may continue to result in, speculation\nregarding future appreciation in the value of cryptocurrencies, inflating and making its market prices more volatile or creating ‚Äúbubble‚Äù type risks for\ncryptocurrencies.\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of forks. Forks in a digital asset network may occur in the future which may affect the value of\ncryptocurrency held by us.\nTo the extent that a significant majority of users and miners on a cryptocurrency network install software that changes the cryptocurrency network or\nproperties of a cryptocurrency, including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new cryptocurrency, the cryptocurrency network\nwould be subject to new protocols and software. However, if less than a significant majority of users and miners on the cryptocurrency network consent to the\nproposed modification, and the modification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, the consequence would be what is known as a ‚Äúfork‚Äù\nof the network, with one prong running the pre-modified software and the other running the modified software. The effect of such a fork would be the existence\nof two versions of the cryptocurrency running in parallel, yet lacking interchangeability and necessitating exchange-type transactions to convert currencies\nbetween the two forks. A fork in a cryptocurrency could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to realize the economic benefit of a fork, either immediately or ever, which could adversely affect our business. If we hold a\ncryptocurrency at the time of a hard fork into two cryptocurrencies, industry standards would dictate that we would be expected to hold an equivalent amount of\nthe old and new assets following the fork. However, we may not be able, or it may not be practical, to secure or realize the economic benefit of the new asset for\nvarious reasons. Additionally, laws, regulations or other factors may prevent us from benefiting from the new asset.\n21\nIf a malicious actor or botnet obtains control in excess of 50% of the processing power active on any cryptocurrency network, it is possible that such\nactor or botnet could manipulate the blockchain in a manner that adversely affects an investment in us.\nIf a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers)\nobtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to mining on any digital asset network it may be able to alter the blockchain by constructing alternate\nblocks if it is able to solve for such blocks faster than the remainder of the miners on the blockchain can add valid blocks. In such alternate blocks, the malicious\nactor or botnet could control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions, though it could not generate new digital assets or transactions using such control.\nUsing alternate blocks, the malicious actor could ‚Äúdouble-spend‚Äù its own digital assets (i.e., spend the same digital assets in more than one transaction) and\nprevent the confirmation of other users‚Äô transactions for so long as it maintains control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet does not yield its\nmajority control of the processing power or the digital asset community does not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to the\nblockchain may not be possible. Such changes could adversely affect an investment in us.\nThe approach towards and possible crossing of the 50% threshold indicate a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation\nof digital asset transactions. To the extent that the digital assets ecosystems do not act to ensure greater decentralization of digital asset mining processing power,\nthe feasibility of a malicious actor obtaining in excess of 50% of the processing power on any digital asset network (e.g., through control of a large mining pool\nor through hacking such a mining pool) will increase, which may adversely impact an investment in us.\nCryptocurrencies, including those maintained by or for us, may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and hacks.\nAs with any computer code generally, flaws in cryptocurrency codes may be exposed by malicious actors. Several errors and defects have been found\npreviously, including those that disabled some functionality for users and exposed users‚Äô information. Exploitation of flaws in the source code that allow\nmalicious actors to take or create money have previously occurred. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, our devices, as well as our miners,\ncomputer systems and those of third parties that we use in our operations, are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including cyberattacks such as viruses and\nworms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or misuse, and similar disruptions from unauthorized\ntampering with our miners and computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations. Such events could have a material adverse effect our\nbusiness, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any Bitcoin that we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.\nOur sponsorship of and investments in a special purpose acquisition company (‚ÄúSPAC‚Äù) may expose us and our funds to increased risks and liabilities.\nWe sponsor, or facilitate the acquisition of a company by a SPAC. A SPAC is a special purpose vehicle formed for the purpose of raising capital to\neventually acquire or merge with an existing business, which results in the existing business becoming the operating business of a public company in an\nalternative to the traditional initial public offering process. There are a number of risks associated with sponsoring a SPAC, including:\n‚Ä¢ since a SPAC is raised without a specifically identified acquisition target, it may never, or only after an extended period of time, be able to find and\nexecute a suitable business combination, during which period the sponsor capital invested in or committed to the SPAC will not be available for other\nuses;\n‚Ä¢ our investments in a SPAC as its sponsor may be entirely lost if the SPAC does not execute a business combination during the finite permitted time\nperiod;\n‚Ä¢ a SPAC incurs substantial fees, costs and expenses related to their initial public offerings, being public companies and pursuing business combinations\n(in some cases, regardless of whether, or when, the SPAC ultimately consummates a transaction);\n22\n‚Ä¢ the use of a SPAC as an investment tool has recently become more widespread, and there remains substantial uncertainty regarding the viability of\nSPAC investing on a large scale, the supply of desirable transactions relative to the pace at which SPACs are currently being formed, potential litigation\nrisks associated with transactions executed by a SPAC and whether regulatory, tax or other authorities will implement additional or adverse policies\nrelating to, or initiate enforcement actions targeting, a SPAC and SPAC investing; and\n‚Ä¢ we expect regulatory scrutiny of and enforcement activities directed toward SPACs and other blank check companies to increase. Any losses relating to\nthese developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow, as well as our reputation.\nIf the SPAC that we sponsor does not complete an initial business combination, our entire investment may be lost (other than with respect to public\nshares we may acquire in the SPAC).\nAs part of our sponsorship of a SPAC, we purchased certain private placement warrants and founder shares of such SPAC at the closing of the SPAC‚Äôs\ninitial public offering. The private placement warrants and the founder shares, and any additional securities we purchase in the SPAC, will be worthless if the\nSPAC does not complete an initial business combination. The personal and financial interests of our officers and directors may influence their motivation in\nidentifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the\ninitial business combination. In addition, we have made working capital and extension loans directly to the SPAC, which are unlikely to be repaid if the SPAC\ndoes not complete an initial business combination. While our SPAC has identified a target and has entered into definitive agreements as such, there is no\nguarantee that it will close.\nOur cash and other sources of liquidity may not be sufficient to fund our operations beyond the next 12 months. We may not be successful in raising\nadditional capital necessary to meet expected increases in working capital needs. If we raise additional funding through sales of equity or equity-based\nsecurities, your shares will be diluted. If we need additional funding for operations and we are unable to raise it, we may be forced to liquidate assets\nand/or curtail or cease operations or seek bankruptcy protection or be subject to an involuntary bankruptcy petition.\nManagement has projected that cash on hand may not be sufficient to allow us to continue operations beyond the next 12 months based on our hashing\nrate at December 31, 2022, if we are unable to raise additional funding for operations. We expect our working capital needs to increase in the future as we\ncontinue to expand and enhance our operations. Our ability to raise additional funds for working capital through equity or debt financings or other sources may\ndepend on the financial success of our then current business and successful implementation of our key strategic initiatives, financial, economic and market\nconditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in raising the required capital at a\nreasonable cost and at the required times, or at all. Further equity financings may have a dilutive effect on shareholders and any debt financing, if available, may\nrequire restrictions to be placed on our future financing and operating activities. If we require additional capital and are unsuccessful in raising that capital, we\nmay not be able to continue our business operations in the cryptocurrency mining industry or we may be unable to advance our growth initiatives, either of\nwhich could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant changes from our current forecasts, including but not limited to: (i) shortfalls from projected sales levels; (ii) fluctuations in the value of\ncryptocurrency; (iii) unexpected increases in product costs; (iv) increases in operating costs; and (v) inability to maintain compliance with the requirements of\nthe NASDAQ Capital Market and/or inability to maintain listing with the NASDAQ Capital Market could have a material adverse impact on our ability to\naccess the level of funding necessary to continue our operations at current levels. If any of these events occurs or we are unable to generate sufficient cash from\noperations or financing sources, we may be forced to liquidate assets where possible and/or curtail, suspend or cease planned programs or operations generally\nor seek bankruptcy protection or be subject to an involuntary bankruptcy petition, any of, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, financial position and liquidity.\n23\nThese factors, among others, raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of\nbusiness and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe urge you to review the additional information about our liquidity and capital resources in Item 7.‚ÄúManagement‚Äôs discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations‚Äù section of this report. If our business ceases to continue as a going concern due to lack of available capital or otherwise, it\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nA cybersecurity breach into our products could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, harm our reputation, expose us to significant\nliability or otherwise damage our financial results.\nWe have in the past, and expect in the future to be, subject to attempted cybersecurity attacks. A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our\nreputation as a trusted provider of storage, and data protection products by adversely impacting the market‚Äôs perception of the security of our products and\nservices. Many of our customers and partners store sensitive data on our products, and a cybersecurity breach related to our products could harm our reputation\nand potentially expose us to significant liability.\nWe also maintain sensitive data related to our employees, partners and customers, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and\npersonally identifiable information on our own systems. We employ sophisticated security measures; however, we may face threats across our infrastructure\nincluding unauthorized access, security breaches and other system disruptions.\nIt is critical to our business that our employees‚Äô, partners‚Äô and customers‚Äô sensitive information remains secure, and that our customers perceive that this\ninformation is secure. A cybersecurity breach could result in unauthorized access to, loss of, or unauthorized disclosure of such information. A cybersecurity\nbreach could expose us to litigation, indemnity obligations, government investigations and other possible liabilities. Additionally, a cyber-attack, whether actual\nor perceived, could result in negative publicity which could harm our reputation and reduce our customers‚Äô confidence in the effectiveness of our solutions,\nwhich could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. A breach of our security systems could also expose us to increased costs\nincluding remediation costs, disruption of operations or increased cybersecurity protection costs that may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough we maintain technology errors and omissions liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of these types or may not be adequate to\nindemnify us for liability that may be imposed. Any imposition of liability or litigation costs that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of our\ninsurance coverage could harm our business.\nWe have a history of net losses. We may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have limited non-recurring revenues derived from operations. We have a history of net losses, and we expect to continue to incur net losses and we\nmay not achieve or maintain profitability. We may see continued losses during 2023 and as a result of these and other factors, we may not be able to achieve,\nsustain or increase profitability in the near future.\nWe are subject to many risks common to early-stage enterprises, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel,\nfinancial, and other resources, technology, and market acceptance issues. There is no assurance that we will be successful in achieving a return on shareholders‚Äô\ninvestment and the likelihood of success must be considered considering our stage of operations.\n24\nOur plans for growth of our service and product segment will place demands upon our resources. If we are unsuccessful in achieving our plan for\ngrowth, our business could be harmed.\nWe are pursuing a plan to grow our market for our services and products domestically. The plan will place demands upon managerial, financial, and\nhuman resources. Our ability to manage future growth will depend in large part upon several factors, including our ability to rapidly:\n‚Ä¢ maintain a sales team to keep end-users and channel partners informed regarding the technical features, issues and key selling points of our services and\nproducts;\n‚Ä¢ attract and retain qualified technical personnel in order to continue to develop reliable and flexible products and provide services that respond to\nevolving customer needs;\n‚Ä¢ maintain support capacity for end-users as sales increase, so that we can provide post-sales support without diverting resources from product\ndevelopment efforts; and\n‚Ä¢ expand our internal management and financial controls significantly, so that we can maintain control over our operations and provide support to other\nfunctional areas as the number of personnel and size increases.\nOur inability to achieve any of these objectives could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur market is competitive and dynamic. New competing products and services could be introduced at any time that could result in reduced profit\nmargins and loss of market share.\nThe technology industry is very dynamic, with new technology and services being introduced by a range of players, from larger established companies to\nstart-ups, on a frequent basis. Our competitors may announce new products, services, or enhancements that better meet the needs of end-users or changing\nindustry standards. Further, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge. Increased competition may cause price reductions, reduced gross\nmargins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate technological changes and develop new and enhanced products.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and increasingly sophisticated customer\nrequirements. The introduction of products embodying new technology and the emergence of new industry standards can negatively impact the marketability of\nour existing products and can exert price pressures on existing products. It is critical to our success that we are able to anticipate and react quickly to changes in\ntechnology or in industry standards and to successfully develop, introduce, manufacture and achieve market acceptance of new, enhanced and competitive\nproducts on a timely basis and cost-effective basis. We invest resources towards continued innovation; however, there can be no assurance that we will\nsuccessfully develop new products or enhance and improve our existing products, that new products and enhanced and improved existing products will achieve\nmarket acceptance or that the introduction of new products or enhanced existing products by others will not negatively impact us. Our inability to develop\nproducts that are competitive in technology and price and that meet end-user needs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations.\nDevelopment schedules for technology products are inherently uncertain. We may not meet our product development schedules, and development costs\ncould exceed budgeted amounts. Our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected if the products or\nproduct enhancements that we develop are delayed or not delivered due to developmental problems, quality issues or component shortage problems, or if our\nproducts or product enhancements do not achieve market acceptance or are unreliable. We or our competitors will continue to introduce products embodying\nnew technologies, such as new sequential or random-access mass storage devices. In addition, new industry standards may emerge. Such events could render our\nexisting products obsolete or not marketable, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\n25\nThe failure to attract, hire, retain and motivate key personnel could have a significant adverse impact on our operations.\nOur success depends on the retention and maintenance of key personnel, including members of senior management and our technical, sales and marketing\nteams. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including competition for such highly skilled personnel; fluctuations in global economic\nand industry conditions; changes in our management or leadership; competitors‚Äô hiring practices; and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. The loss\nof any of these key persons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success is also dependent on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train, motivate and retain highly qualified management, technical, sales,\nmarketing and finance personnel. Any such new hire may require a significant transition period prior to making a meaningful contribution. Competition for\nqualified employees is particularly intense in the technology industry, and we have in the past experienced difficulty recruiting qualified employees. Our failure\nto attract and to retain the necessary qualified personnel could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition. Competition for such personnel can\nbe intense, and no assurance can be provided that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future, which may\nhave a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability. We do not have key person insurance.\nOur financial results may fluctuate substantially for many reasons, and past results should not be relied on as indications of future performance.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to a combination of factors, including, but not limited\nto:\n‚Ä¢ competitive conditions in the industry, including strategic initiatives by us or our competitors, new products or services, product or service\nannouncements and changes in pricing policy by us or our competitors;\n‚Ä¢ varying size, timing and contractual terms of orders for our products, which may delay the recognition of revenue;\n‚Ä¢ our ability to maintain existing relationships and to create new relationships with channel partners;\n‚Ä¢ the discretionary nature of purchase and budget cycles of our customers and end-users;\n‚Ä¢ the length and variability of the sales cycles for our products;\n‚Ä¢ general weakening of the economy resulting in a decrease in the overall demand for our products and services or otherwise affecting the capital\ninvestment levels of businesses with respect to our products or services;\n‚Ä¢ increases in the cost of, or limitations on, the availability of materials; and\n‚Ä¢ changes in product mix.\nFurther, the markets that we serve are subject to market shifts that we may be unable to anticipate. A slowdown in the demand for workstations, mid-\nrange computer systems, networks and servers could have a significant adverse effect on the demand for our products in any given period. In the past, we have\nexperienced delays in the receipt of purchase orders and, on occasion, anticipated purchase orders have been rescheduled or have not materialized due to\nchanges in customer requirements. Our customers may cancel or delay purchase orders for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, the rescheduling of\nnew product introductions, changes in our customers‚Äô inventory practices or forecasted demand, general economic conditions affecting our customers‚Äô markets,\nchanges in our pricing or the pricing of our competitors, new product announcements by us or others, quality or reliability problems related to our products, or\nselection of competitive products as alternate sources of supply.\n26\nThus, there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. We believe that our revenue and operating results\nwill continue to fluctuate, and that period-to-period comparisons are not necessarily indications of future performance. Our revenue and operating results may\nfail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common shares. In addition,\nportions of our expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce if our revenues do not meet our expectations. These fixed expenses magnify the adverse effect of any\nrevenue shortfall.\nOur plans for implementing our business strategy and achieving profitability are based upon the experience, judgment and assumptions of our key\nmanagement personnel, and available information concerning the communications and technology industries. If management‚Äôs assumptions prove to be\nincorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on indirect sales channels to market and sell our branded products. Therefore, the loss of, or deterioration in, our relationship with one or\nmore of our distributors or resellers could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe have relationships with third party resellers, system integrators and enterprise application providers that facilitate our ability to sell and implement our\nproducts. These business relationships are important to extend the geographic reach and customer penetration of our sales force and ensure that our products are\ncompatible with customer network infrastructures and with third party products.\nWe believe that our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain strategic relationships with resellers, independent software vendors,\nsystem integrators, and enterprise application providers. Should any of these third parties go out of business, or choose not to work with us, we may be forced to\nincrease the development of those capabilities internally, incurring significant expense and adversely affecting operating margins. Any of these third parties may\ndevelop relationships with other companies, including those that develop and sell products that compete with ours. We could lose sales opportunities if we fail to\nwork effectively with these parties or they choose not to work with us. Most of our distributors and resellers also carry competing product lines that they may\npromote over our products. A distributor or reseller might not continue to purchase our products or market them effectively, and each determines the type and\namount of our products that it will purchase from us and the pricing of the products that it sells to end user customers. Further, the long-term success of any of\nour distributors or resellers is difficult to predict, and we have no purchase commitments or long-term orders from any of them to assure us of any baseline sales\nthrough these channels.\nTherefore, the loss of, or deterioration in, our relationship with one or more of our distributors or resellers could negatively affect our operating results.\nOur operating results could also be adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n‚Ä¢ a change in competitive strategy that adversely affects a distributor‚Äôs or reseller‚Äôs willingness or ability to stock and distribute our products;\n‚Ä¢ the reduction, delay or cancellation of orders or the return of a significant amount of our products;\n‚Ä¢ the loss of one or more of our distributors or resellers; and\n‚Ä¢ any financial difficulties of our distributors or resellers that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us.\n27\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and similar requirements, changes to which may adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and similar requirements that affect our business and operations, including, but not limited to, the areas of commerce,\nintellectual property, income and other taxes, labor, environmental, health and safety, and our compliance in these areas may be costly. While we have\nimplemented policies and procedures to comply with laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers or agents will\nnot violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Any such violation or alleged violation could materially and adversely affect our business. Any changes or\npotential changes to laws, regulations or similar requirements, or our ability to respond to these changes, may significantly increase our costs to maintain\ncompliance or result in our decision to limit our business or products, which could materially harm our business, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe have made a number of acquisitions in the past and we may make acquisitions in the future. Our ability to identify complementary assets, products\nor businesses for acquisition and successfully integrate them could affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn the future, we may continue to pursue acquisitions of assets, products or businesses that we believe are complementary to our existing business and/or\nto enhance our market position or expand our product portfolio. There is a risk that we will not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates available for\nsale at reasonable prices, complete any acquisition, or successfully integrate any acquired product or business into our operations. We are likely to face\ncompetition for acquisition candidates from other parties including those that have substantially greater available resources. Acquisitions may involve a number\nof other risks, including:\n‚Ä¢ diversion of management‚Äôs attention;\n‚Ä¢ disruption to our ongoing business;\n‚Ä¢ failure to retain key acquired personnel;\n‚Ä¢ difficulties in integrating acquired operations, technologies, products or personnel;\n‚Ä¢ unanticipated expenses, events or circumstances;\n‚Ä¢ assumption of disclosed and undisclosed liabilities; and\n‚Ä¢ inappropriate valuation of the acquired in-process research and development, or the entire acquired business.\nIf we do not successfully address these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition, the acquisition could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, our success will depend, in part, on the extent to which we are able to\nintegrate acquired companies (and any additional businesses with which we may combine in the future) into a cohesive, efficient enterprise. This integration\nprocess may entail significant costs and delays. Our failure to integrate the operations of companies successfully could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects. To the extent that any acquisition results in additional goodwill, it will reduce our tangible net worth, which might\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as our credit capacity and if we proceed with an acquisition, our\navailable cash may be used to complete the transaction, diminishing our liquidity and capital resources, or shares may be issued which could cause significant\ndilution to existing shareholders.\nWe have implemented cost reduction efforts; however, these efforts may need to be modified, and if we need to implement additional cost reduction\nefforts it could materially harm our business.\nWe have implemented certain cost reduction efforts. There can be no assurance that these cost reduction efforts will be successful. As a result, we may\nneed to implement further cost reduction efforts across our operations, such as further reductions in the cost of our workforce and/or suspending or curtailing\nplanned programs, either of which could materially harm our business, results of operations and future prospects.\n28\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur ability to compete depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property. We rely on various intellectual property protections, including\ncopyright, trade-mark and trade secret laws and contractual provisions, to preserve our intellectual property rights. We have filed a number of patent applications\nand have historically protected our intellectual property through trade secrets and copyrights. As our technology is evolving and rapidly changing, current\nintellectual property rights may not adequately protect us.\nIntellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from developing products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products.\nCompetitors may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or, if patents are issued to us, design around these patents. To the extent that we\nhave or obtain patents, such patents may not afford meaningful protection for our technology and products. Others may challenge our patents and, as a result, our\npatents could be narrowed, invalidated or declared unenforceable. The patents that are material to our business began expiring in November 2015. In addition,\nour current or future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the U.S. or foreign countries.\nAlthough we believe we have a proprietary platform for our technologies and products, we may in the future become subject to claims for infringement\nof intellectual property rights owned by others. Further, to protect our own intellectual property rights, we may in the future bring claims for\ninfringement against others.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, upon not infringing intellectual property rights owned by others. Although we believe that we have a\nproprietary platform for our technologies and products, we cannot determine with certainty whether any existing third party patents or the issuance of any third\nparty patents would require us to alter our technology, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. We may become subject to claims by third parties that our\ntechnology infringes their intellectual property rights. While we provide our customers with a qualified indemnity against the infringement of third party\nintellectual property rights, we may become subject to these claims either directly or through indemnities against these claims that we routinely provide to our\nend-users and channel partners.\nFurther, our customers may use our products in ways that may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties and/or require a license from third\nparties. Although our customers are contractually obligated to use our products only in a manner that does not infringe third party intellectual property rights, we\ncannot guarantee that such third parties will not seek remedies against us for providing products that may enable our customers to infringe the intellectual\nproperty rights of others.\nIn addition, we may receive in the future, claims from third parties asserting infringement, claims based on indemnities provided by us, and other related\nclaims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the scope, enforceability and validity of third party proprietary or other rights, or to establish our proprietary or\nother rights. Furthermore, despite precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization. Policing\nunauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult, and some foreign laws do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of Canada or the U.S.\nTo protect our intellectual property, we may become involved in litigation. In addition, other companies may initiate similar proceedings against us. The patent\nposition of information technology firms is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and continues to be the subject of much litigation. No\nconsistent policy has emerged from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the courts regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection\nafforded under information technology patents.\n29\nRisks Related to Our Public Company Status and Our Common Shares\nSales of common shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants, the conversion of outstanding preferred shares, or the effectiveness of our\nregistration statement may cause the market price of our common shares to decline. Currently outstanding preferred shares could adversely affect the\nrights of the holders of common shares.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had in the aggregate 60,000 Series H Preferred Shares outstanding. The conversion of the outstanding Preferred Shares will\nresult in substantial dilution to our common shareholders. Pursuant to our articles of amalgamation, our Board of Directors has the authority to fix and determine\nthe voting rights, rights of redemption and other rights and preferences of preferred stock. The Modified Hertford Agreement also provides for certain resale\nrestrictions applicable to the common shares that are issuable upon the conversion of the remaining Series H Preferred Shares during the two-year period ending\non December 31, 2024, which are different from the restrictions contained in the Hertford Agreement, as well, commencing January 1, 2023 and terminating on\nDecember 31, 2023, holders of Series H Preferred Shares are permitted to (a) convert Series H Preferred Shares in an aggregate amount up to or equal to 3.0% of\nthe aggregate number of Series H Preferred Shares outstanding on the first day of each such month and (b) sell the resulting number (and no greater number) of\nsuch converted common shares within such month. Commencing January 1, 2024 and terminating on December 31, 2024, holders of Series H Preferred Shares\nare permitted to (a) convert Series H Preferred Shares in an aggregate amount up to or equal to 10.0% of the aggregate number of Series H Preferred Shares\noutstanding on the first day of each such month and (b) sell the resulting number (and no greater number) of such converted common shares within such month.\nOn October 1, 2021, we filed articles of amendment to create a series of preferred shares, being, an unlimited number of Series H Preferred Shares and to\nprovide for the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching thereto. Pursuant to the articles of amendment governing the rights and preferences of\noutstanding shares of Series H Preferred Shares, each holder of the Series H Preferred Shares, may, subject to prior shareholder approval, convert all or any part\nof the Series H Preferred Shares provided that after such conversion the common shares issuable, together with all the common shares held by the shareholder in\nthe aggregate would not exceed 9.99% of the total number of our outstanding common shares. Each Series H Preferred Share has a stated value of $1,000 and is\nconvertible into our common shares at a conversion rate equal to one Series H Preferred Share for 1,000 of our common shares. The Series H Preferred Shares\nare non-voting and do not accrue dividends.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2022 we had warrants outstanding for the purchase of up to 19,783,538 common shares having a weighted-average\nexercise price of $8.03 per share. The sale of our common shares upon exercise of our outstanding warrants, the conversion of the Preferred Shares into common\nshares, or the sale of a significant amount of the common shares issued or issuable upon exercise of the warrants in the open market, or the perception that these\nsales may occur, could cause the market price of our common shares to decline or become highly volatile.\nWe may issue additional shares or other equity securities without your approval, which would dilute your ownership interest in us and may depress the\nmarket price of our common shares.\nWe may issue additional shares or other equity securities in the future in connection with, among other things, future acquisitions, repayment of\noutstanding indebtedness or grants without shareholder approval in a number of circumstances. The issuance of additional shares or other equity securities could\nhave one or more of the following effects:\n‚Ä¢ our existing shareholders‚Äô proportionate ownership interest will decrease;\n‚Ä¢ the amount of cash available per share, including for payment of dividends in the future, may decrease;\n‚Ä¢ the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding share may be diminished; and\n‚Ä¢ the market price of our common shares may decline.\n30\nThe market price of our common shares is volatile and may become worthless.\nThe market price for common shares may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our\ncontrol, including the following:\n‚Ä¢ price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market and of bitcoin mining stocks from time to time;\n‚Ä¢ future capital raising activities;\n‚Ä¢ sales of common shares by holders thereof or by us;\n‚Ä¢ changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow us, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n‚Ä¢ the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;\n‚Ä¢ market acceptance of our products and technologies;\n‚Ä¢ rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n‚Ä¢ actual or anticipated changes in our operating results or fluctuations in our operating results;\n‚Ä¢ actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors‚Äô businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n‚Ä¢ litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n‚Ä¢ developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n‚Ä¢ announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n‚Ä¢ new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to us and our business;\n‚Ä¢ any significant change in our executive officers and other key personnel or Board of Directors;\n‚Ä¢ release of transfer restrictions on certain outstanding common shares; and\n‚Ä¢ fluctuating or anticipated changes in power markets.\nFinancial markets may experience price and volume fluctuations that affect the market prices of equity securities of companies and that are unrelated to\nthe operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. Accordingly, the market price of the common shares may decline even if our\noperating results, underlying asset values or prospects have not changed. As well, certain institutional investors may base their investment decisions on\nconsideration of our governance and social practices and performance against such institutions‚Äô respective investment guidelines and criteria, and failure to meet\nsuch criteria may result in a limited or no investment in our common shares by those institutions, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common\nshares. There can be no assurance that fluctuations in price and volume will not occur due to these and other factors.\nIn the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its\nsecurities. We may in the future be a target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert\nmanagement‚Äôs attention from day-to-day operations and consume resources, such as cash. In addition, the resolution of those matters may require us to issue\nadditional common shares, which could potentially result in dilution to our existing shareholders. Expenses incurred in connection with these matters (which\ninclude fees of lawyers and other professional advisors and potential obligations to indemnify officers and directors who may be parties to such actions) could\nadversely affect our cash position.\n31\nIf our performance does not meet market expectations, the price of our common shares may decline.\nIf our performance does not meet market expectations, the price of our common shares may decline. The market value of our common shares may vary\nsignificantly from the price of our common shares on the date of this Annual Report.\nIn addition, fluctuations in the price of our common shares could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. Any of the factors listed below\ncould have a material adverse effect on your investment in our common shares and our common shares may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid\nfor them. Factors affecting the trading price of our common shares may include:\n‚Ä¢ actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial results or the financial results of companies perceived to be similar to it;\n‚Ä¢ changes in the market‚Äôs expectations about our operating results;\n‚Ä¢ success of competitors;\n‚Ä¢ our operating results failing to meet market expectations in a particular period;\n‚Ä¢ changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us;\n‚Ä¢ operating and share price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n‚Ä¢ our ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n‚Ä¢ changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n‚Ä¢ commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n‚Ä¢ changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n‚Ä¢ the volume of our shares available for public sale;\n‚Ä¢ any significant change in our board or management;\n‚Ä¢ sales of substantial amounts of shares by our directors, executive officers or significant shareholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n‚Ä¢ general economic and political conditions such as recessions, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may depress the market price of our common shares irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in\ngeneral and Nasdaq have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the\nparticular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in\nthe market for technology, bitcoin mining or sustainability-related stocks or the stocks of other companies that investors perceive to be similar to us could\ndepress our share price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our common shares\nalso could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nOur share price may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their shares have been subject to\nsecurities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion\nof management‚Äôs attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAny adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\n32\nWe will continue to incur substantial costs and obligations as a result of being a public company.\nAs a publicly-traded company, we will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, new and changing laws, regulations\nand standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure for public companies, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the ‚ÄúSarbanes-Oxley Act‚Äù), regulations related thereto and the rules and regulations of the United States\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (‚ÄúSEC‚Äù) and Nasdaq, have increased the costs and the time that must be devoted to compliance matters. We expect these\nrules and regulations will increase our legal and financial costs and lead to a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities.\nWe must comply with the financial reporting requirements of a public company, as well as other requirements associated with being listed on\nNASDAQ.\nWe are subject to reporting and other obligations under applicable Canadian securities laws, SEC rules and the rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nThese reporting and other obligations, including National Instrument 52-102 - Continuous Disclosure Obligations and National Instrument 52-109 - Certification\nof Disclosure in Issuers‚Äô Annual and Interim Filings, place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational and accounting resources.\nMoreover, any failure to maintain effective internal controls could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our\nconsolidated financial statements. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results could be materially\nharmed, which could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could result in a lower trading price of our common\nshares.\nManagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further,\nthe design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due\nto the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues within a company are detected.\nThe inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or\nmistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls.\nDue to the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error, or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe may be treated as a Passive Foreign Investment Company.\nThere is also an ongoing risk that we may be treated as a Passive Foreign Investment Company (‚ÄúPFIC‚Äù), for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A non-\nU.S. corporation generally will be considered to be a PFIC for any taxable year in which 75% or more of its gross income is passive income, or 50% or more of\nthe average value of its assets are considered ‚Äúpassive assets‚Äù (generally, assets that generate passive income). This determination is highly factual, and will\ndepend upon, among other things, our market valuation and future financial performance. Based on current business plans and financial expectations, we expect\nthat we will not be a PFIC for our tax years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and based on current business plans and financial expectations, we expect that\nwe will not be a PFIC for our current tax year ending December 31, 2023 or for the foreseeable future. If we were to be classified as a PFIC for any future\ntaxable year, holders of our common shares who are U.S. taxpayers would be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.\nCertain of our directors, officers and management could be in a position of conflict of interest.\nCertain of our directors, officers and members of management may also serve as directors and/or officers of other companies. We may contract with such\ndirectors, officers, members of management and such other companies or with affiliated parties or other companies in which such directors, officers or members\nof management own or control. These persons may obtain compensation and other benefits in transactions relating to us. Consequently, there exists the\npossibility for such directors, officers and members of management to be in a position of conflict.\n33\nFuture sales of common shares by directors, officers and other shareholders could adversely affect the prevailing market price for common shares.\nSubject to compliance with applicable securities laws, officers, directors and other shareholders and their respective affiliates may sell some or all of their\ncommon shares in the future. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, such future sales will have on the market price of the common shares prevailing\nfrom time to time. However, the future sale of a substantial number of common shares by our officers, directors and other shareholders and their respective\naffiliates, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common shares.\nWe may issue an unlimited number of common shares. Future sales of common shares will dilute your shares.\nOur articles permit the issuance of an unlimited number of common shares, and shareholders will have no preemptive rights in connection with such\nfurther issuances. Our directors have the discretion to determine the price and the terms of issue of further issuances of common shares in accordance with\napplicable laws.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 2. Properties\nIn January 2022, we entered into a lease agreement for administrative offices and research facilities located in Waxahachie, Texas (the ‚ÄúWaxahachie\nLease‚Äù) for approximately 3,600 square feet and a term of five years. Occupancy was established in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nIn July 2022, we entered into a lease agreement for administrative offices located in Greenwich, Connecticut (the ‚ÄúGreenwich Lease‚Äù) for approximately\n4,200 square feet. The Greenwich Lease began July 11, 2022, has a term of 12 months, without a renewal option.\nWe believe our facilities are adequate for our current and near-term needs.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n34\nPART II\nItem 5. Market For Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOur common shares are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol ‚ÄúANY‚Äù. As of March 22, 2023, we had approximately 36 shareholders\nof record and beneficial owners of our common shares.\nDividends\nWe have not declared or paid any dividends on our common shares to date. Our current intention is to retain any future earnings to support the\ndevelopment of the business of Sphere 3D and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of any future dividends will be at\nthe discretion of the Board of Directors of Sphere 3D after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to the financial condition, operating\nresults, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that Sphere 3D may be a party to at the time. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales\nof their Sphere 3D common shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNot applicable.\nItem 6. [Reserved]\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Annual Report\non Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nActual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in Part I, Item 1A.\nRisks Factors, and elsewhere in this Annual Report. References to ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù are Notes included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOverview\nIn 2022, we commenced operations of our digital mining operation and are dedicated to becoming a leading carbon-neutral Bitcoin mining company. We\nare establishing an enterprise-scale mining operation through procurement of next-generation mining equipment and partnering with experienced service\nproviders. In addition to digital mining, we deliver data management and desktop and application virtualization solutions through hybrid cloud, cloud and on\npremise implementations by its reseller network. We achieve this through a combination of containerized applications, virtual desktops, virtual storage and\nphysical hyper-converged platforms. Our products allow organizations to deploy a combination of public, private or hybrid cloud strategies while backing them\nup with the latest storage solutions.\n2022 and Recent Key Events\n‚Ä¢ In the first quarter of 2023, pursuant to the Modified Hertford Agreement, we issued 5,239,000 common shares for the conversion of 5,239 Series H\nPreferred Shares.\n‚Ä¢ In the first quarter of 2023, we sold 2,066 miners for cash proceeds of $3.1 million.\n‚Ä¢ On November 29, 2022, MEOA held a special meeting of stockholders (the ‚ÄúMEOA Meeting‚Äù). At the MEOA Meeting, MEOA‚Äôs stockholders\napproved an Extension Amendment to MEOA‚Äôs amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which MEOA must\nconsummate its initial business combination from November 30, 2022 to May 30, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by MEOA‚Äôs board of\ndirectors. In connection with the MEOA Meeting, the holders of MEOA‚Äôs shares of its Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such\nshares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account. After giving effect to the redemption MEOA‚Äôs public shares, on November 30, 2022, the\nCompany owned a controlling\n35\ninterest of MEOA and since such time MEOA has been recorded on a consolidated basis.\n‚Ä¢ On November 7, 2022, we entered into an agreement with Hertford Advisors Ltd. (‚ÄúHertford‚Äù) modifying the number of outstanding Series H Preferred\nShares held by Hertford (the ‚ÄúModified Hertford Agreement‚Äù). Pursuant to the Modified Hertford Agreement, the Company cancelled 36,000 Series H\nPreferred Shares, representing 37.5% of the outstanding Series H Preferred Shares, without payment of any cash consideration. Each Series H Preferred\nShare is convertible into 1,000 common shares. Hertford will retain 60,000 Series H Preferred Shares, which are non-voting and do not accrue\ndividends. At our Annual General Meeting held December 20, 2022, shareholders‚Äô approved the conversion of the remaining 60,000 Series H Preferred\nShares, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Company‚Äôs Articles of Incorporation. The Modified Hertford Agreement also provides for\ncertain resale restrictions applicable to the common shares that are issuable upon the conversion of the remaining Series H Preferred Shares during the\ntwo-year period ending on December 31, 2024, which are different from the restrictions contained in the Hertford Agreement.\n‚Ä¢ On October 31, 2022, we filed an arbitration request against Core Scientific, Inc. (‚ÄúCore Scientific‚Äù) regarding the digital mining hosting sub-license\nagreement assigned to us on October 5, 2021. We have requested that certain advanced deposits paid be refunded back to us as a result of the\nmodification to our BitFuFu machine purchase agreement. In December 2022, Core Scientific filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n‚Ä¢ On October 19, 2022, we entered into an amendment to our BitFuFu Agreement. The amended agreement stated no additional payments are required to\nbe made by us, and the purchase order was reduced from 60,000 to approximately 17,000 machines and was completed in December 2022.\n‚Ä¢ In September 2022, Compute North filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In December 2022, the Compute North MA was assigned to GC Data Center\nGranbury, LLC (the ‚ÄúGC Data Center MA‚Äù) and has a term of five years from such assignment date. A deposit of $0.5 million previously paid to\nCompute North for the last two months of monthly service fees was remitted to GC Data Center on behalf of the Company and is included in other\nassets in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022.\n‚Ä¢ On July 25, 2022, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC notifying the\nCompany that it was not in compliance with the requirement of Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued inclusion on the NASDAQ Capital\nMarket as a result of the closing bid price for the Company‚Äôs common stock being below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days. On January 24, 2023,\nwe received notification from Nasdaq indicating that we will have an additional 180-day grace period, or until July 24, 2023, to regain compliance with\nthe Listing Rule's $1.00 minimum bid requirement for at least 10 consecutive business days. This notification has no effect on the listing of the\nCompany‚Äôs common shares at this time.\n‚Ä¢ On February 15, 2022, and subsequently on March 7, 2022, primarily as a result of comments we received from the SEC relating to an amendment to\nthe registration statement on Form F-4 we filed with the SEC on January 4, 2022 in connection with our proposed merger with Gryphon, we retained\ntwo independent investment banks to review the terms of the proposed Gryphon merger transaction. The nature of the review was to provide an\nindependent analysis as to whether the consideration to be paid by us in the proposed merger was fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view\nand to assess the inputs to the financial models that were used to test such fairness. On April 4, 2022, the Merger Agreement was terminated. The\nMerger Agreement, among other matters, provided that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, we would forgive all amounts outstanding under\nthe outstanding Promissory Note and Security Agreement as amended with Gryphon (the ‚ÄúGryphon Note‚Äù), and release to Gryphon 850,000 common\nshares previously deposited into an escrow account for the benefit of Gryphon. As a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement in the second\nquarter of 2022, we forgave the Gryphon Note which had a balance of $13.1 million and released the 850,000 common shares held in escrow to\nGryphon. We will continue our relationship with Gryphon through the Gryphon Master Services Agreement entered into in 2021.\n36\nResults of Operations - Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nRevenue\nWe had revenue of $6.1 million during 2022 compared to $3.7 million during 2021. The $2.4 million increase in net revenue is due to the addition of $3.4\nmillion in revenues from our digital mining operation, offset by a decrease of $1.0 million in service and product, primarily due to the sale of our SnapServer\nproduct line. The majority of our revenue was derived from digital currency mining and data management services. Income from our mining segment is a result\nof bitcoin mining activities in the United States. Income from our product and services segment is primarily generated in the United States.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, direct cost of revenues were $3.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, representing an increase of\n$1.7 million, or 100%, primarily due to the addition of our digital mining operation.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing Expense\nSales and marketing expenses were $1.0 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease of $0.3\nmillion was primarily due to decreases in advertising and employee related costs associated with a lower average headcount, and share-based compensation.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expenses were $0.6 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease of\n$0.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in employee and related expenses associated with a lower average headcount.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $24.1 million and $12.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of\n$11.2 million was primarily due to increases of $8.2 million in share-based compensation primarily related to awards granted to a former executive and certain\ncurrent executives, $4.5 million primarily related to professional services associated with our expansion into the digital mining industry, $0.9 million of\nadditional insurance cost primarily related to our director and officers‚Äô insurance, $0.6 million in employee and related expenses primarily associated with a\nhigher average headcount and an executive bonus, $0.4 million of costs primarily related to our transaction with Gryphon which was terminated on April 4,\n2022, and $0.3 million of costs related to audit services. These increases were offset by decreases of $2.0 million for legal expenses primarily related to a prior\nyear legal settlement expense not recurring, $1.4 million for a fair value adjustment for a Bitcoin liability subsequently forgiven, and $0.3 million for public\nrelations.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $28.3 million and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of\n$22.6 million was primarily due to amortization related to our intangible asset for costs directly related to the acquisition of digital mining machines and\ndepreciation of digital mining machines.\nImpairment of Mining Equipment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, adverse changes in the business climate, including the decline in the price of Bitcoin and two vendor bankruptcy\nfilings, indicated that an impairment triggering event occurred, and it was determined the carrying value of mining equipment exceeded its estimated fair value.\nIn measuring fair value, we used a weighted probability of the income and market approaches. We compared the indicated fair value to the carrying value of our\nmining equipment assets, and as a result of the analysis, an impairment charge of $75.9 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n37\nProvision for Losses on Deposits Due to Vendor Bankruptcy Filings\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of two vendors filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, we made provisions of $16.1 million on our\npreviously made deposits to the two such digital mining hosting vendors.\nImpairment of Acquired Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nImpairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets were $13.2 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, adverse changes in the business climate, including the decline in the price of Bitcoin and two of our\nvendors, Core Scientific and Compute North filing for bankruptcy, indicated that an impairment triggering event occurred, and we determined the carrying value\nof finite-lived intangible assets exceeded its estimated fair value. In measuring fair value, we used a weighted income and market approach. We compared the\nindicated fair value to the carrying value of its finite-lived assets, and as a result of the analysis, an impairment charge of $13.2 million was recorded for supplier\nagreements for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of the disposal of our SnapServer¬Æ product line, it was determined the carrying value of\nfinite-lived intangible assets exceeded its estimated fair value. In measuring fair value, we used an excess of earnings approach. We compared the indicated fair\nvalue to the carrying value of our finite-lived assets, and as a result of the analysis, an impairment charge of $298,000 was recorded for developed technology\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn October 2021, we disposed of our SnapServer¬Æ product line and removed the related goodwill of $863,000 and is included in the net gain on sale of the\nasset. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we performed qualitative impairment evaluations on our remaining goodwill and determined that there were\nindications that the goodwill was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $522,000.\nImpairment of Digital Assets\nImpairment of digital assets was $1.1 million and nil for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of $1.1 million was due\nto impairment losses recognized on our digital assets.\nNon-Operating Expenses\nImpairment of Investments\nImpairment of investments was $14.5 million and nil for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of $14.5 million was\ndue to a $12.4 million impairment loss recognized on our Filecoiner investments, and $2.1 million impairment loss recognized on our Silicon Valley Technology\nPartners Preferred Shares. The fair value of the Filecoiner investments was impacted by the decrease in the price of Filecoin since the time of the investments\nresulting in an impairment.\nForgiveness of Note Receivable\nForgiveness of note receivable was $13.1 million and nil for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of $13.1 million\nwas due to the forgiveness of our note receivable, including accrued interest, with Gryphon which occurred when the Merger Agreement with Gryphon was\nterminated by us on April 4, 2022.\nProvision for Losses on Deposit for Mining Equipment\nProvision for deposit on mining equipment was $10.0 million and nil for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of\n$10.0 million was due to a provision made for the deposit we made to NuMiner Global, Inc. (‚ÄúNuMiner‚Äù) for the purchase of mining machines. During the\nsecond quarter of 2022, we requested the return of the deposit when the purchase agreement was cancelled due to NuMiner not delivering mining machines\naccording to the agreement terms.\n38\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was nil and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease of $0.5 million was related to the\nsettlement of all outstanding debt in 2021, primarily our Oasis debt and related interest expense and debt costs. We have no outstanding debt at December 31,\n2022.\nInterest Income and Other, Net\nInterest income and other, net, was $2.6 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, we recognized a\ngain on forgiveness of liabilities of $2.1 million and interest income of $0.6 million from our notes receivable. In 2021, we sold our SnapServer¬Æ product line\nand recorded a gain on the sale of the assets of $5.0 million, in addition, we recognized a gain on the forgiveness of PPP Funds of $1.1 million, including\naccrued interest, $0.6 million in interest income from notes receivable, and $0.2 million gain on forgiveness of liabilities for settlement of legal fees; offset by\nwarrants issued with a fair value of $2.8 million in consideration for Westworld waiving its rights to consent to any and all past, present and future additional\nfinancings by us, $0.7 million penalty fee related to the Series E Preferred for the failure to file a timely registration statement required under the securities\npurchase agreement and $0.6 million of fees paid to Maxim for penalties related to our fund raises in July and August of 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have recurring losses from operations. Our primary source of cash flow is generated from digital mining revenue and service revenue. We have\nfinanced our operations through proceeds from the issuance of public and private equity securities. At December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents\nfrom continuing operations of $1.3 million compared to $54.4 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents is related primarily to\npayments for mining equipment and prepayments for power and hosting for our digital mining operation. As of December 31, 2022, we had working capital of\n$4.1 million, reflecting a decrease in current assets of $68.1 million and an increase in current liabilities of $1.0 million compared to December 31, 2021. The\ndecrease in current assets was primarily related to cash outflows for operations, mining equipment and hosting services, as well a $16.1 million provision on two\nvendor deposits for prepaid hosting services as a result of two vendors filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2022. The increase in current liabilities was primarily\nrelated to an increase in accrued payroll and employee compensation and liabilities and an advance of funds from our SPAC‚Äôs identified target for its business\ncombination. Cash management continues to be a top priority. We may incur negative operating cash flows as we work to maintain and increase our digital\nmining revenue, product sales volume, and maintain operational efficiencies.\nManagement has projected that cash on hand may not be sufficient to allow us to continue operations beyond the next 12 months based on our hashing\nrate at December 31, 2022, if we are unable to raise additional funding for operations. We expect our working capital needs to increase in the future as we\ncontinue to expand and enhance our operations. Our ability to raise additional funds for working capital through equity or debt financings or other sources may\ndepend on the financial success of our then current business and successful implementation of our key strategic initiatives, financial, economic and market\nconditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in raising the required capital at a\nreasonable cost and at the required times, or at all. Further equity financings may have a dilutive effect on shareholders and any debt financing, if available, may\nrequire restrictions to be placed on our future financing and operating activities. If we require additional capital and are unsuccessful in raising that capital, we\nmay not be able to continue our business operations in the cryptocurrency mining industry or we may be unable to advance our growth initiatives, either of\nwhich could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant changes from our current forecasts, including but not limited to: (i) shortfalls from projected sales levels; (ii) fluctuations in the value of\ncryptocurrency; (iii) unexpected increases in product costs; (iv) increases in operating costs; and (v) inability to maintain compliance with the requirements of\nthe NASDAQ Capital Market and/or inability to maintain listing with the NASDAQ Capital Market could have a material adverse impact on our ability to\naccess the level of funding necessary to continue our operations at current levels. If any of these events occurs or we are\n39\nunable to generate sufficient cash from operations or financing sources, we may be forced to liquidate assets where possible and/or curtail, suspend or cease\nplanned programs or operations generally or seek bankruptcy protection or be subject to an involuntary bankruptcy petition, any of, which would have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nOn November 30, 2022, after giving effect to the redemption of certain public redeemable shares of MEOA, our subsidiary owns a controlling interest of\nMEOA and it has been consolidated. The following table shows a summary of our cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities, investing activities and\nfinancing activities, including MEOA beginning November 30, 2022 (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (30,771) $ (28,518)\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (22,041) $ (122,693)\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ ‚Äî $ 205,105\nNet cash used in operating activities. The use of cash during 2022 was primarily a result of our net loss of $192.9 million, offset by $180.1 million in non-\ncash items, which primarily included impairments on mining equipment and intangibles, a provision for losses on deposits made due to vendor bankruptcy\nfilings, forgiveness of a note receivable, impairment of investments, provision for losses on deposit for mining equipment, amortization of intangible assets,\ndepreciation, share-based compensation expense, gain of forgiveness of liabilities, change in fair value of crypto asset payable, change in fair value of warrant\nliabilities, and impairment of digital assets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $16.5 million for prepayments for our digital asset hosting\nagreements.\nNet cash used in investing activities. During 2022, we paid $17.6 million towards digital asset mining machines and shipping costs, we entered into\npromissory notes receivable with Gryphon and MEOA for $2.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, and we purchased $0.3 million of carbon credits for future\nuse. The Gryphon note receivable was forgiven on April 4, 2022 upon termination of the Merger Agreement with Gryphon. During 2021, we paid a\n$92.0 million down payment to BitFuFu for a deposit towards cryptocurrency machines for which delivery began in January 2022, paid a $10.0 million\nrefundable deposit to NuMiner with the intent to enter into an agreement with NuMiner to purchase 60,000 units of new NM440 Machines for the purpose of\ncryptocurrency mining, purchased 1,500,000 shares of common stock of Filecoiner, Inc., a private company, of $6.0 million, and paid $5.4 million for the\npurchase of private placement warrants of the SPAC we are sponsoring.\nNet cash provided by financing activities. During 2021, we received $196.6 million from the issuance of common shares and exercise of warrants, $9.6\nmillion from the issuance of preferred shares, and $0.3 million from the exercise of stock options; offset by $1.1 million of payments for notes payable and $0.2\nmillion of payments for preferred share dividends.\nOff-Balance Sheet Information\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we may provide standby letters of credit to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by us. We\nhave one standby letter of credit to be used for the bond necessary for us to receive mining machines. As of December 31, 2022, there was restricted cash of\n$0.2 million pledged as collateral for the standby letter of credit.\n40\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us\nto make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities. We review our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be\nreasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results\nmay differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of\nour consolidated financial statements include estimates associated with the impairment analysis of long-lived assets. Our significant accounting policies are\noutlined in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLong-lived Assets\nWe estimate the fair value of long-lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value\nof the asset may not be recoverable. We test for potential impairment of other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually or whenever indicators\nof impairment arise. Significant estimates and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the long-lived assets. A change in any of the estimates and\nassumptions used may result an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their\neffect, if any, on us.\nItem 7A.

Based\non this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give\nreasonable assurance that information required to be publicly disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis as of the end of the\nperiod covered by this annual report.\n41\nManagement‚Äôs Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness\nof internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment, including testing,\nusing the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (‚ÄúCOSO‚Äù). Our\nsystem of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBased on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over\nfinancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk\nthat controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial\nreporting. Management's report on internal control over financial reporting was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm\npursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this Annual Report.\nThis report on internal control over financial reporting shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise\nsubject to the liabilities of that section, and is not incorporated by reference into any of our filings, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of\nany general incorporation language in such filing.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

The goals of our program are to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced executives and to provide\ncompensation opportunities that are linked to corporate and individual performance. Decisions by the Compensation Committee on our executive compensation\nprograms are subjective and the result of our business judgment, which is informed by the experiences of our members. The named executive officers do not\nhave any role in determining their own compensation, although the Compensation Committee does consider the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer\nin setting compensation levels for the named executive officers other than himself. The primary components of our executive compensation program are base\nsalary, performance bonuses and long-term equity incentive awards.\nBase Salaries. Base salaries are primarily intended to attract and retain highly qualified executives by providing them with fixed, predictable levels of\ncompensation. Such base salaries are subject to periodic review and adjustment by the Compensation Committee.\nPerformance Bonuses. The Compensation Committee did not approve a bonus plan for fiscal 2022.\n48\nLong-Term Equity Incentive Awards. Long-term equity incentives are intended to align the named executive officers‚Äô interests with those of our\nshareholders as the ultimate value of these awards depends on the value of our shares. We have historically granted equity awards in the form of stock options\nwith an exercise price that is equal to the per-share closing price of our common shares on the grant date. In recent years, restricted stock units have also been\ngranted as provided for under our 2015 Plan. The Compensation Committee believes that stock options are an effective vehicle for aligning the interests of our\nexecutives with those of our shareholders as the executive will only realize value on their options if the share price increases during the period between the grant\ndate and the date the stock option is exercised. The stock options and restricted stock units function as a retention incentive for the named executive officers as\nthey typically vest over a multi-year period following the date of grant. Restricted stock units, which are payable in our common shares, also link the interests of\nthe award recipient with those of our shareholders as the potential value of the award is directly linked to the value of our common shares. The named executive\nofficers‚Äô equity awards are subject to accelerated vesting in certain circumstances under their agreements with us are described below.\nEmployment, Severance and Change in Control Agreements\nPatricia Trompeter.

In February 2018, Mr. O‚ÄôDaniel received an award of\nfully vested common shares in lieu of cash for a portion of the retention bonus leaving an outstanding balance of $533,802.

Our Board of Directors has broad authority to administer the 2015 Plan, including the authority to select participants and determine the types of awards\nthat they are to receive, determine the grants levels, vesting and other terms and conditions of awards, and construe and interpret the terms of the 2015 Plan and\nany agreements relating to the plan.\n52\nA total of 15,262,425 common shares are authorized for issuance with respect to awards granted under the 2015 Plan (not including shares subject to\nterminated awards under our Second Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan that become available for issuance under the 2015 Plan). In addition, the share\nlimit automatically increases on the first trading day in January of each calendar year during the term of the 2015 Plan (commencing with January 2020) by an\namount equal to the lesser of (i) ten percent (10%) of the total number of common shares issued and outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding\ncalendar year, or (ii) such number of common shares as may be established by the Board. Awards under the 2015 Plan may be in the form of incentive or\nnonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses, restricted stock, stock units and other forms of awards including cash awards. Awards under\nthe plan generally will not be transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, except that the plan administrator may authorize certain\ntransfers.\nThe number and type of shares available under the 2015 Plan and any outstanding awards, as well as the exercise or purchase prices of awards, are subject\nto customary adjustments in the event of stock splits, stock dividends and certain other corporate transactions. Generally, and subject to limited exceptions set\nforth in the 2015 Plan, if we dissolve or undergo certain corporate transactions such as a merger, business combination or other reorganization, or a sale of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets, all awards then-outstanding under the 2015 Plan will become fully vested or paid, as applicable, and will terminate or be\nterminated in such circumstances, unless the Board of Directors provides for the assumption, substitution or other continuation of the award. The Board of\nDirectors also has the discretion to establish other change in control provisions with respect to awards granted under the 2015 Plan.\nThe Board of Directors may amend or terminate the 2015 Plan at any time, but no such action will affect any outstanding award in any manner materially\nadverse to a participant without the consent of the participant. Plan amendments will be submitted to stockholders for their approval as required by applicable\nlaw or deemed advisable by the Board of Directors. If not earlier terminated by the Board of Directors, the 2015 Plan will terminate on May 14, 2025. The 2015\nPlan is not exclusive - the Board of Directors may grant stock and performance incentives or other compensation, in stock or cash, under other plans or authority.\n53\nCompensation of Directors\nThe following table provides compensation information for the members of our Board of Directors during 2022 who were not employed by us or any of\nour subsidiaries (‚Äúnon-employee directors‚Äù).

Ms. Trompeter was a\nnon-employee director until April 4, 2022 and was paid compensation for her service on the Board as described in the Summary Compensation Table above. Mr.\nTassiopoulos was not entitled to any additional compensation for his service on the Board during fiscal 2022.\nAll Other\nFees Earned Option Awards(1) Compensation Total\nName ($) ($) ($) ($)\nDavid Danziger(2) 2,446 99,981 ‚Äî 102,427\nTimothy Hanley(3) 52,555 97,699 ‚Äî 150,254\nSusan Harnett(4) 10,883 ‚Äî ‚Äî 10,883\nVivekanand Mahadevan 62,995 201,985 ‚Äî 264,980\nDuncan McEwan 92,258 201,985 ‚Äî 294,243\n_______________\n(1) The amounts shown in this column represent the fair value on the grant date of the awards granted to the non-employee directors during fiscal year\n2022 and do not reflect compensation actually received by the non-employee director. These values have been determined under the principles used to\ncalculate the grant date fair value of equity awards for purposes of our financial statements. For a more detailed discussion on the valuation model and\nassumptions used to calculate the fair value of these awards, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included herein. The details of these\nstock options are described below. At December 31, 2022, the end of our last fiscal year, Mr. Danziger held outstanding stock options for 423,290\ncommon shares, Mr. Hanley held outstanding stock options for 123,000 common shares, and Messrs. Mahadevan and McEwan each held outstanding\nstock options for 552,638 common shares. Our non-employee directors did not hold any stock awards at the end of our last fiscal year.\n(2) Mr. Danziger joined the Board on December 20, 2022.\n(3) Mr. Hanley joined the Board on May 31, 2022.\n(4) Ms. Harnett joined the Board on November 11, 2022.\nFrom January 1, 2022 through May 31, 2022, the non-employee directors earned $10,000 per quarter for their service on the Board except that the Chair\nof the Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Board (or in such circumstances where the Chairman of the Board was not independent of management of the\nCompany, the Lead Board Member) earned $12,500 per quarter for their service on the Board. Each non-employee director was also entitled to receive restricted\nstock units valued at $40,000 based upon the closing price of our common shares on the first business day of the year, subject to Board approval (‚ÄúAnnual Stock\nAward‚Äù).\nIn May 2022, we reviewed our Board compensation as compared to our crypto-mining competitors (‚ÄúCompetitors‚Äù) and determined that the Board\ncompensation was not commensurate with our Competitors or for the time involvement and industry risks for our directors. To attract talented individuals to join\nthe Board, we believed it was in the best interest of us to change the Board compensation. On May 27, 2022, the Board approved a new compensation program\nfor non-employee board members. Beginning June 1, 2022, the non-employee board members will each receive the following compensation: (a) an annual cash\npayment of $75,000, payable quarterly in arrears (and pro-rated for partial quarterly periods), (b) in the case of the Chairman of the Board, an additional annual\ncash payment of $20,000, payable quarterly in arrears (and prorated for partial quarterly periods), (c) in the case of a Chairman of each subcommittee of the\nBoard (being the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee and Compensation Committee), an additional annual cash payment of $15,000, payable quarterly in\narrears (and pro-rated for partial quarterly periods), and\n54\n(d) on an annual basis and at the election of the non-employee director, either: (i) restricted share units having a value of $100,000, to be priced at the market\nclose on the day of our next annual shareholder‚Äôs meeting, such restricted stock units to vest 364 days following the date of grant, or (ii) that number of stock\noptions equal to $100,000 divided by the value of the options at the time of grant (to be determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model) to be priced at the\nmarket close on the day of our next annual shareholder‚Äôs meeting, such stock options to vest in full 364 days following the date of grant (the ‚ÄúNew Board\nCompensation Program‚Äù), provided there are sufficient shares available in the 2015 Plan. Pursuant to the New Board Compensation Program, Messrs. Hanley,\nMcEwan and Mahadevan each received a stock option for 123,000 shares with an exercise price of $1.06 vesting in full on December 20, 2022 and expiring on\nMay 31, 2028.\nOn June 10, 2022, the Board retroactively approved the Annual Stock Award for Messrs.

McEwan and Mahadevan opted to receive stock options (in lieu of restricted stock units) and each received a stock\noption for 6,348 shares with an exercise price of $0.90 vesting in full on December 31, 2022.

The value of the stock option was\nbased upon the closing price of the Company‚Äôs stock on December 20, 2022, the date of the annual shareholders meeting during fiscal 2022.\nOn February 28, 2023, Ms. Harnett and Mr. Hanley each received 322,580 restricted stock units of the Company valued at $133,484 based upon the\nclosing price of our common shares on February 28, 2023 of $0.4138, vesting in full on December 19, 2023.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany as of December 31, 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Matter\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial\nstatements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and does not expect to have sufficient working capital to fund its operations that raise\nsubstantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial\nstatements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company‚Äôs management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company‚Äôs financial\nstatements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\")\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were\nwe engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control\nover financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nAccordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial\nstatements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,\nor complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ MaloneBailey, LLP\nwww.malonebailey.com\nWe have served as the Company‚Äôs auditor since 2022.\nHouston, Texas\nMarch 31, 2023\nF-1\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nSphere 3D Corp.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Sphere 3D Corp. and its subsidiaries (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) which comprise the\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operation, comprehensive loss, cash flows, and shareholders‚Äô\nequity (deficit) for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ‚Äúconsolidated financial statements‚Äù).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as at\nDecember 31, 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nMaterial Uncertainty Related to Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in\nNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has a net working capital deficiency, and may not be\nable to amend, refinance, or pay off its debt and credit facilities, that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management‚Äôs plans\nin regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome\nof this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company‚Äôs management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany‚Äôs consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (‚ÄúPCAOB‚Äù) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to\nhave, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company‚Äôs internal control over financial\nreporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures\nin the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nF-2\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements;\nand (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate\nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of Filecoiner, Inc. Preferred Shares\nAs described in Notes 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company received 8,000 Series B preferred shares of Filecoiner, Inc.\n(‚ÄúFilecoiner‚Äù) (‚ÄúFilecoiner Series B shares‚Äù) as consideration for the sale of its SnapServer product line to Filecoiner. The fair value of the Filecoiner Series B\nshares was estimated to be $6.4 million by management. The valuation of the Filecoiner Series B shares required management to make significant estimates and\njudgments. Management determined the fair value using a Monte Carlo Simulation and a capital option pricing model. The significant assumptions used by\nmanagement to value the Filecoiner Series B shares included Filecoiner‚Äôs forecasted revenues, discount rate, volatility, risk free rate and cost of debt.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to valuation of Filecoiner preferred shares is a critical audit matter\nare (i) the significant judgments by management to determine the fair values of the series B preferred shares, which included significant assumptions related to\nFilecoiner‚Äôs revenue forecast, discount rate, volatility and cost of debt; (ii) the significant audit effort due to a high degree of auditor subjectivity and judgment\nto evaluate the audit evidence obtained related to the significant assumptions used in the valuation, and (iii) the audit effort which involved the use of\nprofessionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures also included, among others, (i) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in\ndeveloping an independent range of possible valuations of Filecoiner Series B shares based on third party data and independently developed assumptions of\nFilecoiner‚Äôs discount rate, volatility and cost of debt, and (ii) comparing the independent estimate to management‚Äôs estimate to evaluate the reasonableness of\nmanagement‚Äôs estimate.\nValuation of equity instruments issued under the Hertford Agreement\nAs described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company issued 4,500,000 common shares with a fair value of $11.4 million and\n96,000 Series H Preferred Shares (‚ÄúSeries H shares‚Äù) with a fair value of $42.4 million to Hertford Advisors Ltd. (‚ÄúHertford‚Äù) for rights to a number of\ncryptocurrency mining hardware agreements and a mining facility agreement. In addition, as described in Note 11, the Company issued 2,880,000 common\nshares with a fair value of $12.8 million as a fee to Majestic Dragon. The valuation of the Series H shares and common shares issued by the Company required\nmanagement to make significant estimates and judgments. The significant assumptions used by management to value the Series H shares included fair market\nvalue estimates of comparable cryptocurrency mining hardware equipment. The significant assumptions used by management to value the common shares\nissued to Hertford and Majestic Dragon involved assessing a relevant holding period, risk free rate and volatility.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to valuation of equity instruments issued under the Hertford\nAgreement is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgments by management to determine the fair values of the Series H shares and common shares\nissued; (ii) the significant audit effort due to a high degree of auditor subjectivity and judgment to evaluate the audit evidence obtained related to the significant\nassumptions used in the valuation, and (iii) the audit effort which involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nF-3\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures also included, among others, (i) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in\ndeveloping an independent range of possible valuations for the equity instruments issued based on third party data and independently developed assumptions of\nthe Company‚Äôs risk free rate, holding period and volatility, and (ii) comparing the independent estimate to management‚Äôs estimate to evaluate the reasonableness\nof management‚Äôs estimate.\n/s/ Smythe LLP\nChartered Professional Accountants\nVancouver, Canada\nMarch 30, 2022\nWe served as the Company‚Äôs auditor from 2019 to 2022.\nF-4\nSphere 3D Corp.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except shares)\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,337 $ 54,355\nDigital assets 1,695 ‚Äî\nRestricted cash 206 ‚Äî\nAccounts receivable, net 174 181\nNotes receivable 3,821 1,859\nOther current assets 3,051 22,027\nTotal current assets 10,284 78,422\nProperty and equipment, net 34,259 ‚Äî\nIntangible assets, net 9,477 63,017\nFunds held in trust account 10,297 ‚Äî\nInvestments ‚Äî 19,949\nNotes receivable ‚Äî 11,988\nOther assets 18,699 102,548\nTotal assets $ 83,016 $ 275,924\nLiabilities and Shareholders‚Äô Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 2,993 $ 1,252\nAccrued liabilities 1,537 3,250\nAccrued payroll and employee compensation 696 199\nDeferred revenue 160 210\nOther current liabilities 814 297\nTotal current liabilities 6,200 5,208\nDeferred underwriting fee 4,554 ‚Äî\nWarrant liabilities 864 ‚Äî\nDeferred revenue, long-term 56 58\nOther non-current liabilities 310 1,032\nTotal liabilities 11,984 6,298\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 14)\nSeries H preferred shares, no par value, unlimited shares authorized, 60,000 and 96,000 shares issued and outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively 26,469 42,350\nRedeemable non-controlling interest 9,998 ‚Äî\nTotal temporary equity 36,467 42,350\nShareholders‚Äô equity:\nCommon shares, no par value; 68,631,104 and 63,566,403 shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, respectively 456,402 444,265\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (1,799) (1,794)\nAccumulated deficit (419,732) (215,195)\nTotal Sphere 3D Corp. shareholders‚Äô equity 34,871 227,276\nNon-controlling interest (306) ‚Äî\nTotal shareholders' equity 34,565 227,276\nTotal liabilities, temporary equity, and shareholders‚Äô equity $ 83,016 $ 275,924\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-5\nSphere 3D Corp.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nRevenues:\nDigital mining revenue $ 3,443 $ ‚Äî\nService and product revenue 2,634 3,720\nTotal revenues 6,077 3,720\nOperating costs and expenses:\nCost of digital mining revenue 2,044 ‚Äî\nCost of service and product revenue 1,373 1,718\nSales and marketing 1,009 1,317\nResearch and development 605 971\nGeneral and administrative 24,134 12,927\nDepreciation and amortization 28,263 5,685\nImpairment of mining equipment 75,922 ‚Äî\nProvision for losses on deposits due to vendor bankruptcy filings 16,069 ‚Äî\nImpairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 13,182 820\nImpairment of digital assets 1,148 ‚Äî\nTotal operating expenses 163,749 23,438\nLoss from operations (157,672) (19,718)\nOther income (expense):\nImpairment of investments (14,529) ‚Äî\nForgiveness of note receivable (13,145) ‚Äî\nProvision for losses on deposit for mining equipment (10,000) ‚Äî\nInterest income and other, net 2,600 2,930\nInterest expense, related party ‚Äî (495)\nInterest expense ‚Äî (21)\nLoss before income taxes (192,746) (17,304)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes 166 (15)\nNet loss (192,912) (17,289)\nLess: Non-controlling interest loss (111) ‚Äî\nNet loss attributable to Sphere 3D Corp.

Organization and Business\nSphere 3D Corp. was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) on May 2, 2007 as T.B. Mining Ventures Inc. On March 24, 2015, the\nCompany completed a short-form amalgamation with a wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with the short-form amalgamation, the Company changed its\nname to ‚ÄúSphere 3D Corp.‚Äù Any reference to the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù, ‚ÄúSphere 3D‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, or similar terms refers to Sphere 3D Corp. and its subsidiaries. In\nJanuary 2022, the Company commenced operations of its digital mining operation dedicated to becoming a leading carbon-neutral Bitcoin mining company. The\nCompany is establishing an enterprise-scale mining operation through procurement of next-generation mining equipment and partnering with experienced\nservice providers. In addition, the Company delivers data management and desktop and application virtualization solutions through hybrid cloud, cloud and on\npremise implementations by its global reseller network. The Company achieves this through a combination of containerized applications, virtual desktops,\nvirtual storage and physical hyper-converged platforms. The Company‚Äôs products allow organizations to deploy a combination of public, private or hybrid cloud\nstrategies while backing them up with the latest storage solutions. The Company‚Äôs brands include HVE ConneXions (‚ÄúHVE‚Äù) and Unified ConneXions\n(‚ÄúUCX‚Äù). In October 2021, the Company sold its SnapServer¬Æ product line and associated assets.\nSpecial Purpose Acquisition Company\nIn April 2021, the Company sponsored a special purpose acquisition company (‚ÄúSPAC‚Äù), Minority Equality Opportunities Acquisition Inc. (‚ÄúMEOA‚Äù),\nthrough its wholly owned subsidiary, Minority Equality Opportunities Acquisition Sponsor, LLC (‚ÄúSPAC Sponsor‚Äù). The registration statement for MEOA‚Äôs\nInitial Public Offering was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‚ÄúSEC‚Äù) on August 25, 2021. On August 30, 2021, MEOA\nconsummated the IPO. After the securities comprising the units trading under the symbol ‚ÄúMEAOU‚Äù began separate trading, the shares of Class A common\nstock and warrants were listed on NASDAQ under the symbols ‚ÄúMEOA‚Äù and ‚ÄúMEOAW,‚Äù respectively.\nIn connection with the meeting of the stockholders of MEOA that was held on November 29, 2022, the holders of MEOA‚Äôs shares of its Class A common\nstock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account. After giving effect to the redemption of MEOA‚Äôs public\nshares, on November 30, 2022, the Company owns a controlling interest and MEOA has been consolidated.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nThe Company has recurring losses from operations and incurred a net loss of approximately $192.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nManagement has projected that cash on hand may not be sufficient to allow the Company to continue operations beyond the next 12 months based on our\nhashing rate at December 31, 2022, if we are unable to raise additional funding for operations. We expect our working capital needs to increase in the future as\nwe continue to expand and enhance our operations. Our ability to raise additional funds for working capital through equity or debt financings or other sources\nmay depend on the financial success of our then current business and successful implementation of our key strategic initiatives, financial, economic and market\nconditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in raising the required capital at a\nreasonable cost and at the required times, or at all. Further equity financings may have a dilutive effect on shareholders and any debt financing, if available, may\nrequire restrictions to be placed on our future financing and operating activities. We require additional capital and if we are unsuccessful in raising that capital,\nwe may not be able to continue our business operations in the cryptocurrency mining industry or we may be unable to advance our growth initiatives, either of\nwhich could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nF-11\nSignificant changes from the Company‚Äôs current forecasts, including but not limited to: (i) shortfalls from projected sales levels; (ii) unexpected increases\nin product costs; (iii) increases in operating costs; (iv) fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrency; and (v) inability to maintain compliance with the requirements\nof the NASDAQ Capital Market and/or inability to maintain listing with the NASDAQ Capital Market could have a material adverse impact on the Company‚Äôs\nability to access the level of funding necessary to continue its operations at current levels. If any of these events occurs or the Company is unable to generate\nsufficient cash from operations or financing sources, the Company may be forced to liquidate assets where possible and/or curtail, suspend or cease planned\nprograms or operations generally or seek bankruptcy protection or be subject to an involuntary bankruptcy petition, any of, which would have a material adverse\neffect on the Company‚Äôs business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nThese factors, among others, raise substantial doubt that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal\ncourse of business and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nTerminated Merger Agreement\nOn June 3, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, which was subsequently amended on December 29, 2021 (the ‚ÄúMerger\nAgreement‚Äù), which the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. (‚ÄúGryphon‚Äù) through a\nmerger transaction (the ‚ÄúMerger‚Äù).\nOn February 15, 2022, and subsequently on March 7, 2022, primarily as a result of comments the Company received from the SEC relating to an\namendment to the registration statement on Form F-4 we filed with the SEC on January 5, 2022 in connection with our proposed merger with Gryphon, we\nretained two independent investment banks to review the terms of the proposed Gryphon merger transaction. The nature of the review was to provide an\nindependent analysis as to whether the consideration to be paid by us in the proposed merger was fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view and to\nassess the inputs to the financial models that were used to test such fairness.\nOn April 4, 2022, the Merger Agreement was terminated. The Company and Gryphon will continue its relationship through the Gryphon Master Services\nAgreement entered into in 2021.\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America (‚ÄúGAAP‚Äù), applied on a basis consistent for all periods. Subsidiaries in which controlling interests are maintained are consolidated.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been appropriately eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. The reclassifications did not have a material\nimpact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nF-12\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe financial statements of the Company‚Äôs foreign subsidiary, for which the functional currency is the local currency, is translated into U.S. dollars using\nthe exchange rate at the consolidated balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and a weighted-average exchange rate during the year for revenue, expenses,\ngains and losses. Translation adjustments are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders‚Äô equity. Gains or losses from foreign currency\ntransactions are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Such transactions resulted in a loss of $46,000 and $41,000 for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nHighly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original maturities of three months or less, when purchased, are classified as cash\nequivalents. Cash equivalents are composed of money market funds. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that\nexceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to these balances and believes credit risk to be minimal.\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nRestricted cash is cash held in a separate bank account with restrictions on withdrawal. The Company‚Äôs restricted cash classified as current, is pledged as\ncollateral for a standby letter of credit to be used for the bonding purpose necessary for the Company to receive mining machines.\nFunds held in trust account are restricted and invested in U.S. government treasury money market funds. Except with respect to interest earned on the\nfunds held in the trust account that may be released to MEOA, to pay its franchise and income tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution\nexpenses), the proceeds will not be released from the trust account to MEOA until the earliest of: (a) the completion of MEOA‚Äôs initial business combination; or\n(b) the redemption of the public shares if MEOA is unable to complete the initial business combination on or prior to May 30, 2023, subject to applicable law.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable is recorded at the invoiced amount and is non-interest bearing. The Company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts based on\nan assessment of the collectability of specific accounts and the overall condition of the accounts receivable portfolio. When evaluating the adequacy of the\nallowance for doubtful accounts, the Company analyzes specific trade and other receivables, historical bad debts, customer credits, customer concentrations,\ncustomer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customers‚Äô payment terms and/or patterns. The Company reviews the allowance for\ndoubtful accounts on a quarterly basis and record adjustments as considered necessary. Customer accounts are written-off against the allowance for doubtful\naccounts when an account is considered uncollectable. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, allowance for doubtful accounts of $3,200 and nil, respectively, was\nrecorded.\nDigital Assets\nThe Company accounts for digital assets as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The digital assets are recorded at cost less impairment.\nAn impairment analysis is performed at each reporting period or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more\nlikely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. The fair value of digital assets is determined on a nonrecurring basis based on the lowest intraday\nquoted price on the active exchange(s) that the Company has determined as the principal market for digital assets (Level 1 inputs). If the carrying value of the\ndigital asset exceeds the fair value based on the lowest price quoted in the active exchanges during the period, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to\nthose digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their carrying values and the price determined.\nF-13\nImpairment losses are recognized in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment is identified.\nThe impaired digital assets are written down to their fair value at the time of impairment and this new cost basis will not be adjusted upward for any subsequent\nincrease in fair value. Gains are not recorded until realized upon sale or disposition.\nDigital assets awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated statements\nof cash flows. The sales of digital assets are included within operating activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and any realized\ngains or losses from such sales are included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company accounts for its gains or\nlosses in accordance with the first in first out (FIFO) method of accounting.\nThe following table presents the activities of the digital assets (in thousands):\nBalance at January 1, 2022 $ ‚Äî\nAddition of digital assets 3,443\nDigital assets issued for services (619)\nRealized gain on sale of digital assets 19\nImpairment loss (1,148)\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 1,695\nInvestments\nThe Company holds investments in equity securities of public and nonpublic companies for business and strategic purposes. The nonpublic equity\nsecurities do not have a readily determinable fair value and are carried at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price\nchanges in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The Company reviews its investments on a regular basis to determine\nif the investments are impaired. For purposes of this assessment, the Company considers the investee‚Äôs cash position, earnings and revenue outlook, liquidity and\nmanagement ownership, among other factors, in its review. If management‚Äôs assessment indicates that an impairment exists, the Company estimates the fair\nvalue of the equity investment and recognizes in current earnings an impairment loss that is equal to the difference between the fair value of the equity\ninvestment and its carrying amount.\nLeases\nThe Company has entered into operating leases primarily for real estate. These leases have contractual terms which range from 12 months to 5 years. The\nCompany determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Right of use (‚ÄúROU‚Äù) assets and liabilities resulting from operating leases are included in\nproperty and equipment, other liabilities and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are\nrecognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As the leases typically do not provide\nan implicit rate, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the discount rate to\ncalculate the present value of future payments. The operating lease ROU asset may also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives and\ninitial direct costs incurred. The Company‚Äôs leases do not include options to extend the lease. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not\nrecorded on the balance sheet. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consists of mining equipment is stated at cost, including purchase price and all shipping and custom fees, and depreciated using\nthe straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally five years.\nF-14\nThe Company reviews the carrying amounts of property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets may not be\nrecoverable. If any such indication exists, the fair value of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.\nIntangible Assets\nFor intangible assets purchased in a business combination, the estimated fair values of the assets received are used to establish their recorded values. For\nintangible assets acquired in a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred (or the estimated fair values of the assets received, if\nmore clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost\napproach are used to measure fair value.\nPurchased intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic lives of 15 months to 15 years for supplier agreements, six years for\nchannel partner relationships, and seven years for customer relationships as this method most closely reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the\nassets will be consumed.\nThe Company has purchased carbon credits that it intends to use. As it intends to use these carbon credits, the assets have been classified as intangible\nassets. When the carbon credit is used, it will be expensed as an operating expense.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nThe Company performs regular reviews of intangible assets to determine if any event has occurred that may indicate that intangible assets with finite\nuseful lives and other long-lived assets are potentially impaired. Triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or\neconomic trends, restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization. Intangible assets are quantitatively\nassessed for impairment, if necessary, by comparing their estimated fair values to their carrying values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the\ndifference is recorded as an impairment.\nWarrant Liabilities\nWarrant liabilities are for warrants for shares of MEOA‚Äôs common stock that are not indexed to its own stock are presented as liabilities at fair value on\nthe consolidated balance sheets. The warrants are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized in interest\nincome and other, net, on the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss\non the consolidated statements of cash flows. The fair value of the public warrants issued in connection with MEOA's public offering has been measured based\non the listed market price of such warrants. The Company recorded a fair value adjustment for warrant liabilities of $0.3 million for the year ended December\n31, 2022.\nRedeemable Non-controlling Interest\nRedeemable non-controlling interest is interest in a subsidiary of the Company that are redeemable outside of the Company‚Äôs control either for cash or\nother assets. This interest is classified as temporary equity and measured at the estimated redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting\nincreases or decreases in the estimated redemption amount are effected by corresponding charges to accumulated deficit. At December 31, 2022, redeemable\nnon-controlling interest recorded within the Company‚Äôs consolidated balance sheets relates to its subsidiary, MEOA.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for revenue pursuant to ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments (‚ÄúTopic 606‚Äù).\nUnder Topic 606, an entity is required to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and contract consideration will be recognized on a ‚Äúsell-in basis‚Äù\nor when control of the purchased goods or services transfer to the distributor.\nThe Company is engaged with digital asset mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining\nF-15\npools. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the mining pool operator\nreceives for successfully adding a block to the blockchain, plus a fractional share of the transaction fees attached to that blockchain. The Company‚Äôs fractional\nshare is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all\nmining pool participants in solving the current algorithm. The Company satisfies its performance obligation at the point in time that the Company is awarded a\nunit of digital currency through its participation in the applicable network and network participants benefit from the Company‚Äôs verification service. The\ntransaction price is the fair value of the digital asset mined, being the fair value per the prevailing market rate for that digital asset on the transaction date, and\nthis is allocated to the number of digital assets mined. The transaction consideration the Company receives is noncash consideration, in the form of digital\ncurrency, which the Company measures at fair value on the date received which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or time the\nCompany has earned the award from the mining pools. Fair value of the digital currency award received is determined using the spot price of the related digital\ncurrency on the date earned. The Company cannot determine, during the course of solving for a block, that a reversal of revenue is not probable and therefore\nrevenue is recognized when the mining pool operator successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm) and the Company receives\nconfirmation of the consideration it will receive.\nExpenses associated with running the digital asset mining operations, such as equipment depreciation, rent, operating supplies, utilities and monitoring\nservices are recorded as cost of revenues.\nThe Company also generates revenue from: (i) solutions for standalone storage and integrated hyper-converged storage; (ii) professional services; and (iii)\nwarranty and customer services. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with\ncustomers the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) identify the performance obligations in\nthe contract, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including the constraint on variable\nconsideration; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the\nperformance obligations.\nThe majority of the Company‚Äôs product and service revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer\nare satisfied at a point in time. These contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation to transfer products. Accordingly, the Company\nrecognizes revenue when change of control has been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of shipment of products. The Company sells its products\nboth directly to customers and through distributors generally under agreements with payment terms typically less than 45 days. Revenue on direct product sales,\nexcluding sales to distributors, are not entitled to any specific right of return or price protection, except for any defective product that may be returned under our\nstandard product warranty. Product sales to distribution customers that are subject to certain rights of return, stock rotation privileges and price protections,\ncontain a component of ‚Äúvariable consideration.‚Äù Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for\ntransferring products and is generally based upon a negotiated fixed price and is net of estimates for variable considerations.\nFor performance obligations related to warranty and customer services, such as extended product warranties, the Company transfers control and\nrecognizes revenue on a time-elapsed basis. The performance obligations are satisfied as services are rendered typically on a stand-ready basis over the contract\nterm, which is generally 12 months.\nThe Company also enters into revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple performance obligations of its product and service offerings such as for\nsales of hardware devices and extended warranty services. The Company allocates contract fees to the performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling\nprice basis. The Company determines the stand-alone selling price based on its normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product and/or service\nwhen sold separately. When the Company is unable to establish the individual stand-alone price for all elements in an arrangement by reference to sold\nseparately instances, the Company may estimate the stand-alone selling\nF-16\nprice of each performance obligation using a cost plus a margin approach, by reference to third party evidence of selling price, based on the Company‚Äôs actual\nhistorical selling prices of similar items, or based on a combination of the aforementioned methodologies; whichever management believes provides the most\nreliable estimate of stand-alone selling price.\nExtended Warranty\nSeparately priced extended on-site warranties and service contracts are offered for sale to customers on all product lines. The Company contracts with\nthird party service providers to provide service relating to on-site warranties and service contracts. Extended warranty and service contract revenue and amounts\npaid in advance to outside service organizations are deferred and recognized as service revenue and cost of service, respectively, over the period of the service\nagreement. The Company will typically apply the practical expedient to agreements wherein the period between transfer of any good or service in the contract\nand when the customer pays for that good or service is one year or less. Advanced payments for long-term maintenance and warranty contracts do not give rise\nto a significant financing component. Rather, such payments are required by the Company primarily for reasons other than the provision of finance to the entity.\nShipping and Handling\nAmounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue, and costs incurred related to shipping and handling are included in cost of\nproduct revenue.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were nil and $104,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, share-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses\nassociated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs. Research and\ndevelopment expenses are charged to operating expenses as incurred when these expenditures relate to the Company‚Äôs research and development efforts and\nhave no alternative future uses.\nSegment Information\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief\noperating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding the method to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company has two operating\nsegments.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company provides for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes\nrepresent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes\ngenerally represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences\nbetween the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation\nallowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when a judgment is made that it is considered more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. A\ndecision to record a valuation allowance results in an increase in income tax expense or a decrease in income tax benefit. If the valuation allowance is released in\na future period, income tax expense will be reduced accordingly.\nThe calculation of tax liabilities involves evaluating uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. The impact of an uncertain income\ntax position is recognized at the largest amount that is ‚Äúmore likely than not‚Äù to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax\nposition will not be recognized\nF-17\nif it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense\nwould result.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) and its components encompass all changes in equity other than those arising from transactions with shareholders, including\nnet loss and foreign currency translation adjustments, and is disclosed in a separate consolidated statement of comprehensive loss.\nConcentration of Credit Risks\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of notes receivable and trade accounts receivable, which\nare generally not collateralized. To reduce credit risk, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintain allowances for potential\ncredit losses for estimated bad debt losses.\nShare-based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based awards, and similar equity instruments, granted to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants in\naccordance with the authoritative guidance for share-based compensation. Share-based compensation award types include stock options, restricted stock units\n(‚ÄúRSUs‚Äù) and restricted stock awards (‚ÄúRSAs‚Äù). Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the requisite service period\n(usually the vesting period) except for options with graded vesting which is recognized pursuant to an accelerated method. Forfeitures are recognized as a\nreduction in share-based compensation expense as they occur.\nNon-controlling Interest\nThe Company accounts for its non-controlling interest in accordance with the authoritative guidance for consolidation which governs the accounting for\nand reporting of non-controlling interests (‚ÄúNCIs‚Äù) in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of control of subsidiaries. Certain provisions of the\nguidance indicate, among other things, that NCIs be treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability, that increases and decreases in the parent‚Äôs\nownership interest that leave control intact be treated as equity transactions rather than as step acquisitions or dilution gains or losses, and that losses of a\npartially owned consolidated subsidiary be allocated to the NCI even when such allocation might result in a deficit balance. The net income (loss) attributed to\nthe NCI is separately designated in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‚ÄúFASB‚Äù) that are adopted by the Company\nas of the specified effective date. If not discussed, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards, which are not yet effective, will not have a\nmaterial impact on the Company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (‚ÄúASU‚Äù) No. 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and\nDerivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity‚Äôs Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (‚ÄúASU 2020-06‚Äù). The new guidance eliminates the beneficial conversion and\ncash conversion accounting models for convertible instruments. It also amends the accounting for certain contracts in an entity‚Äôs own equity that are currently\naccounted for as derivatives because of specific settlement provisions. In addition, the new guidance requires that the if-converted method is used in computing\ndiluted EPS for all convertible instruments. The update is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2021.\nThe adoption of the new standard did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nAccounting pronouncements pending adoption\nOn October 28, 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from\nContracts with Customers (‚ÄúASU 2021-08‚Äù). ASU 2021-08 amends ASC 805 to require\nF-18\nacquiring entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. The new standard is\neffective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2023 and interim periods within its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2023. Early adoption is\npermitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this update will have a significant impact on its financial statements.\n3. Disposal of SnapServer¬Æ Product Line\nIn October 2021, the Company and Filecoiner, Inc. (‚ÄúFilecoiner‚Äù) entered into an acquisition agreement under which the Company‚Äôs subsidiary, HVE,\nsold the assets, including intellectual property, associated with the Company‚Äôs SnapServer¬Æ product line to Filecoiner, in exchange for 8,000 shares of Series B\npreferred stock of Filecoiner (‚ÄúFilecoiner Series B Preferred Stock‚Äù) with a fair value equal to $6.4 million determined using valuation models. The Company\nrecorded a gain on the sale of the assets of $5.0 million and is included in interest income and other, net on the consolidated statement of operations.\n4. Fair Value Measurements\nThe authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in\nactive markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore\nrequiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe Company‚Äôs consolidated financial instruments include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, investments, accounts payable,\naccrued liabilities, warrant liabilities and preferred shares. Fair value estimates of these instruments are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant\nmarket information. These estimates may be subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be\ndetermined with precision. The carrying amount of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are generally\nconsidered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of those instruments.\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nAs discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company accounts for its bitcoin as\nindefinite-lived intangible assets, which are subject to impairment losses if the fair value of its bitcoin held decreases below their carrying value during the\nreporting period.\nThe Company's non-financial assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets are recorded at fair value when an impairment is recognized or\nat the time acquired in an asset acquisition or business combination measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). As discussed in Note 7 - Certain\nBalance Sheet Items and Note 8 - Intangible Assets, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded impairment charges associated with property and\nequipment, acquired intangible assets and goodwill and reduced the carrying amount of such assets subject to the impairment to their estimated fair value.\nAs discussed in Note 8 Intangible Assets and Goodwill and Note 9 Preferred Shares, in October 2021, the Company issued preferred shares with a fair\nvalue of $42.4 million to Hertford. The fair value was measured using Level 2 inputs, which included publicly available machine contract pricing. In addition, in\nAugust 2021, the Company issued common shares to Hertford with a fair value of $11.4 million. The fair value was measured using Level 1 and 2 inputs, which\nincluded a marketability discount.\nAs discussed in Note 10 Share Capital, in October 2021, the Company issued common shares with a fair value of $12.8 million to Majestic Dragon. The\nfair value was measured using Level 1 and 2 inputs, which included a marketability discount.\nF-19\n5.

Such note is payable upon the earlier of consummation of MEOA‚Äôs initial business combination, without interest, or, the\nliquidation of MEOA. At the SPAC Sponsor‚Äôs discretion, the promissory note would be convertible into warrants of MEOA at a price of $1.00 per warrant upon\nthe completion of MEOA‚Äôs initial business combination.\nIn February, March 2022 and September 2022, the Company‚Äôs subsidiary, SPAC Sponsor, in connection with the MEOA Commitment Agreement,\nentered into promissory notes with MEOA for a loan in the aggregate amount of $0.5 million. Such note is payable upon consummation of MEOA‚Äôs initial\nbusiness combination, without interest, or, at the SPAC Sponsor‚Äôs discretion, would be convertible into warrants of MEOA at a price of $1.00 per warrant. If\nMEOA does not complete a business combination in the required timeframe such note would be forgiven.\nOn November 30, 2022, after giving effect to the redemption of public shares of MEOA, the Company‚Äôs subsidiary owns a controlling interest of MEOA\nand it has been consolidated. These two above promissory notes are eliminated in consolidation at December 31, 2022.\nRainmaker Promissory Note\nIn September 2020, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note with Rainmaker (the ‚ÄúRainmaker Note‚Äù), pursuant to which\nthe Company loaned Rainmaker the principal amount of $3.1 million.

The Gryphon Note was unsecured and bore interest at the rate of 9.5% per annum. On April 4, 2022, the Merger Agreement was terminated and\n$13.1 million, including interest, was forgiven and written off to other expense. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding Gryphon Note balance,\nincluding accrued interest, was nil and $10.3 million, respectively.\n6.
