Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for\nthe Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of\nEureka Bancorp, Inc. and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical\nrequirements related to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and\nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nResponsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements\nin accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the\ndesign, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation\nof consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nTo the Board of Directors\nEureka Homestead Bancorp, Inc.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are\nconditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about Eureka Homestead\nBancorp, Inc.’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated\nfinancial statements are available to be issued.\nAuditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a\nwhole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that\nincludes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and\ntherefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards\nwill always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement\nresulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,\nintentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered\nmaterial if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the\njudgement made by a reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, we:\n• Exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether\ndue to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures\ninclude examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that\nare appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness\nof Eureka Homestead Bancorp, Inc.’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant\naccounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements.\n• Conclude whether, in our judgement, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that\nraise substantial doubt about Eureka Homestead Bancorp, Inc.’s ability to continue as a going concern\nfor a reasonable period of time.\nWe are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the\nplanned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters\nthat we identified during the audit.\nColumbus,

INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nNote 1 - Nature of Operations, Principles of Consolidation, Use of Estimates and Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies -\nNature of Operations\nEureka Homestead Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTC Pink Marketplace – ERKH) was formed to\nserve as the stock holding company for Eureka Homestead (the “Bank”) upon completion of its mutual-\nto-stock conversion. The conversion was effective July 9, 2019. In connection with the conversion, the\nCompany sold 1,429,676 shares of its common stock, including 114,374 shares purchased by the Bank’s\nemployee stock ownership plan, at a price of $10.00 per share.\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in these financial statements to\n“we, “us”, “our”, “Company” and “Bank” refer collectively to Eureka Homestead Bancorp, Inc. and\nEureka Homestead on a consolidated basis or to any of those entities, depending on the context.\nThe Bank is a federal stock savings association subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company conducts lending and deposit-\ntaking activities from two locations in the New Orleans, Louisiana area. The Company provides service to\ncustomers in the New Orleans and surrounding areas. The accounting and reporting policies of the\nCompany are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America\nand conform to general practices within the industry.\nThe Company’s loan portfolio consists mainly of loans to homeowners; however, the Company's loan\nportfolio does include loans secured by non-residential real estate. The majority of loans are secured by first\nmortgages on area real estate and are expected to be repaid from the cash flow of the borrower. Some of the\nactivities upon which the economy of the New Orleans area is dependent include the petrochemical\nindustry, the port of New Orleans and economic activity along that region of the Mississippi River,\nhealthcare and tourism. Significant declines in these activities and the general economic conditions in the\nCompany's market areas could affect the borrower’s ability to repay loans and cause a decline in value of\nthe assets securing the loan portfolio.\nThe Company’s operations are subject to customary business risks associated with activities of a financial\ninstitution. Some of those risks include competition from other institutions and changes in local or national\neconomic conditions, interest rates and regulatory requirements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, include\nthe Company and the Bank, together referred to as the Company. Intercompany transactions and balances\nhave been eliminated in consolidation.\n13\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the guidance under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No.\n2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\nThe main provisions of the ASU have been codified by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) in\nTopic 326 of the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC 326”) and introduced an impairment model that\nis based on current expected credit losses (“CECL”), rather than incurred losses, to estimate credit losses on\ncertain types of financial instruments. ASC 326 requires financial assets measured on an amortized cost\nbasis, including loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, to be presented at an amount net of an allowance\nfor credit losses, which reflects expected losses for the full life of the financial asset. Unfunded lending\ncommitments and other off-balance sheet credit exposures are also within the scope of ASC 326. Under\nformer GAAP, credit losses were not recognized until the occurrence of the loss was probable and, as a\nresult, the allowance for credit losses did not reflect an estimate of credit losses for the full life of financial\nassets.\nIn addition, ASC 326 requires expected credit related losses for available-for-sale debt securities to be\nrecorded through an allowance for credit losses, while non-credit related losses will continue to be\nrecognized through other comprehensive income. Under former GAAP, we assessed our debt securities for\nother-than-temporary impairment and any declines in fair value that were deemed other-than-temporary\nresulted in a direct write-down to the amortized cost basis of the related security. The allowance approach\nallows estimated expected credit losses to be adjusted from period-to-period, as opposed to a permanent\nwrite-down.\nThe Company applied the guidance under ASC 326 using the modified retrospective approach which could\nhave resulted in an adjustment to beginning retained earnings for 2023. The information for reporting\nperiods beginning on and after January 1, 2023, are presented under ASC 326, while prior periods continue\nto be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. There was no impact of ASC Topic 326 to\nbeginning retained earnings for 2023.\nUnder ASC 326, the Company groups loans and unfunded lending commitments with similar risk\ncharacteristics into pools or segments and collectively evaluates each pool to estimate the allowance for\ncredit losses. For each pool of loans, management utilizes a Scaled CECL Allowance for Credit Loss\nEstimator (“SCALE”) methodology to estimate credit losses over the expected life of the loan. The life of\nthe loan excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications, unless the extension or renewal options\nare included in the original or modified contract terms and are not unconditionally cancellable by the\nCompany. The methodology incorporates industry and peer expected lifetime loss rates and qualitative\nadjustments, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts and estimated repayments reported on Call\nreport schedule RI-C.\nFor each pool of loans, management also evaluates and applies additional qualitative adjustments specific to\nthe Company to the calculated allowance for credit losses based on several factors, including, but not\nlimited to, changes in current and expected future economic conditions, changes in industry experience and\nloan concentrations, changes in credit quality, changes in lending policies and personnel and changes in the\ncompetitive and regulatory environment of the banking industry.\nThe ultimate loss rates computed for each loan pool (a product of our quantitative calculation and\nqualitative adjustments) are used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending\ncommitments. The pooled loan loss rates are applied to the portion of the unfunded lending commitments\nthat management expects to fund in the future. These unfunded commitments are segmented into pools\nconsistent with our grouping of outstanding loans and include available portions of lines of credit,\n14\nundisbursed portions of construction loans and commitments to originate new loans. The allowance for\nunfunded commitments is included in Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities.\nLoans are individually evaluated for credit losses when they do not share similar risk characteristics with\nour identified loan pools under ASC 326. Generally, management considers loans for individual analysis\nwhen we have identified certain unique characteristics that impact the risk of credit loss. These\ncharacteristics include, but are not limited to, the creditworthiness of the borrower, the reliability of the\nprimary source of repayment, the quality of the collateral, the size of the loan or relationship, and the\nindustry of the borrower. The allowance for credit losses on individually evaluated, collateral-dependent\nloans is based on a comparison of the recorded investment in the loan with the fair value of the underlying\ncollateral. Alternatively, we estimate credit losses on non-collateral-dependent individual loans by\ncomparing the loan’s recorded investment to the loan’s estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows\nor an observable market price.\nAt adoption of ASC 326, Management also evaluated its securities portfolio for credit losses. The types of\nsecurities in the Company’s portfolio have a long history of minimal credit risk and management does not\nexpect or estimate any credit losses to occur over the life of these assts. In addition, management does not\nhave the intent to sell any of the Company’s securities in an unrealized loss position and believes that it is\nmore likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any such securities before recovery of cost. As a\nresult, the Company has not recorded an allowance for credit losses for its available-for-sale securities.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326), Troubled\nDebt Restructurings (“TDRs”) and Vintage Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU respond to feedback\nreceived by the FASB during the post-implementation review of the amendments included in ASU 2016-13.\nThe amendments in ASU 2022-02 eliminate the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors in ASC 310-40,\nReceivables – Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors and enhance disclosure requirements for certain\nloan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Under\nthe amendments in ASU 2022-02, an entity must apply the guidance under ASC 310-20 to determine\nwhether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan rather than applying the\nguidance for TDRs. The amendments in ASU 2022-02 were effective at adoption of the amendments in\nASU 2016-13. The implementation of ASU 2022-02 did not materially impact the Company’s financial\nstatements or disclosures.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\nthe disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the\ndetermination of the allowance for credit losses, the valuation of other real estate acquired, the valuation\nof deferred tax assets and the fair value of financial instruments.\nThe determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on estimates that are\nparticularly susceptible to significant changes in the economic environment and market conditions. In\nconnection with the determination of the estimated losses on loans and debt securities, management\nobtains independent appraisals for significant collateral or valuations for fair market values.\n15\nWhile management uses available information to recognize losses on loans and debt securities, further\nreductions in the carrying amounts of loans and debt securities may be necessary based on changes in\nlocal economic conditions. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination\nprocess, periodically review the estimated losses on loans. Such agencies may have judgments different\nthan management’s and we may determine to adjust our allowance as a result of these regulatory reviews.\nBecause of these factors, it is reasonably possible that the estimated losses on loans and debt securities\nmay change in the near term. However, the amount of the change that is reasonably possible cannot be\nestimated.\nDebt Securities\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“FASB ASC”) 320,\nInvestments, requires the classification of securities as trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity.\nManagement determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-\nevaluates this classification periodically.\nSecurities classified as available-for-sale are equity securities with readily determinable fair values and\nthose debt securities that the Company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time but not necessarily\nto maturity. Any decision to sell a security classified as available-for-sale would be based on various\nfactors, including significant movement in interest rates, changes in the maturity mix of the Company’s\nassets and liabilities, liquidity needs, regulatory capital considerations, and other similar factors. These\nsecurities are carried at estimated fair value, less any allowance for credit losses, based on information\nprovided by a third party pricing service with any unrealized gains or losses excluded from net income\nand reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is reported as a separate\ncomponent of equity, net of the related deferred tax effect.\nDebt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as\nheld-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost, less any allowance for credit losses.\nDebt securities that are bought and held by the Company primarily for the purpose of selling them in the\nnear future are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are\nincluded in earnings. The Company did not have any trading or held-to-maturity securities at December\n2023 or 2022.\nPremiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security, adjusted for\nanticipated prepayments, as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method. Mortgage-backed\nsecurities are subject to prepayment and, accordingly, actual maturities could differ from contractual\nmaturities. Interest income is recognized when earned. Gains and losses from the sale of securities are\nincluded in earnings when realized and are determined using the specific identification method for\ndetermining the cost of securities sold.\nPrior to the adoption of ASC 326, declines in the fair value of individual debt securities below their cost\nthat were other than temporary resulted in write-downs of the individual securities to their fair value. The\nwritten down amount then became the security’s new cost basis. The related write-downs were included in\nearnings as realized losses. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, management\nconsidered (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the\nfinancial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to\nretain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in\nfair value.\n16\nLoans Receivable\nThe Company grants real estate mortgage and consumer loans to customers. Loans that management has\nthe intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off are reported at their\noutstanding unpaid principal balances adjusted for unearned income, the allowance for credit losses, and\nany unamortized deferred fees or costs on originated loans, and premiums or discounts on purchased loans.\nWhen principal or interest is delinquent for 90 days or more, the Company evaluates the loan for nonaccrual\nstatus.\nUncollectible interest on loans that are contractually past due is charged-off, or a contra account is\nestablished based on management's periodic evaluation. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the\nloan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off at an earlier date if collection of\nprincipal or interest is considered doubtful. The contra account is established by a charge to interest\nincome equal to all interest previously accrued, and income is subsequently recognized only to the extent\nthat cash payments are received until, in management's judgment, the borrower has the ability to make\ntimely periodic interest and principal payments, in which case the loan is returned to accrual status.\nLoan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and the net fee or cost is recognized as an\nadjustment to interest income using the interest method over the contractual life of the loans, adjusted for\nactual prepayments. Amortization of net deferred fees or costs is discontinued for the loans that are\ndeemed to be non-performing. Additionally, the unamortized net fees or costs are recognized in income\nwhen loans are paid-off.\nLoans Held-for-Sale\nMortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost\nor fair value. For these loans, gains and losses on loan sales are recorded in noninterest income, and direct\nloan origination costs and fees are deferred at origination of the loan and are recognized in noninterest\nincome upon sale of the loan.\nIndividual Loans with Different Risk Characteristics\nThe allowance for credit losses for individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans is\nmeasured as the difference between the discounted value of expected future cash flows, based on the\neffective interest rate at origination, and the amortized cost basis of the loan, or the net realizable value. The\nallowance for credit losses is the difference between the loan’s net realizable value and its amortized cost\nbasis (net of previous charge-offs and deferred loan fees and costs), except for collateral-dependent loans. A\nloan is collateral dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment of the\nloan is expected to be provided substantially through the sale of the collateral. The expected credit loss for\ncollateral-dependent loans is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the loan and\nthe fair value of the collateral, adjusted for the estimated cost to sell. Fair value estimates for collateral-\ndependent loans are derived from appraised values based on the current market value or the ‘as is’ value of\nthe collateral, normally from recently received and reviewed appraisals. Current appraisals are ordered on\nan annual basis based on the inspection date or more often if market conditions necessitate. Appraisals are\nobtained from state-certified appraisers and are based on certain assumptions, which may include\nconstruction or development status and the highest and best use of the property. These appraisals are\nreviewed by management to ensure they are acceptable, and values are adjusted down for costs associated\nwith asset disposal. If the calculated expected credit loss is determined to be permanent or not recoverable,\nthe amount of the expected credit loss is charged off.\n17\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level which is considered to be adequate to reflect\nestimated credit losses in the loan and investment portfolios in accordance with ASC 326.\nManagement evaluates the allowance for credit losses to assess the risk of loss in the loan and securities\nportfolios and to determine the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. For purposes of this\nevaluation, loans are aggregated into pools based on various characteristics. Some of those\ncharacteristics include payment status, concentrations, and loan to collateral value and the financial status\nof borrowers. In addition to these factors, management also considers the following for each segment of\nthe loan portfolio when determining the allowance:\n•Residential mortgages - This category consists of loans secured by first and junior liens on residential real\nestate. The performance of these loans may be adversely affected by unemployment rates, local\nresidential real estate market conditions and the interest rate environment.\n•Commercial real estate - This category consists of loans primarily secured by office buildings, and retail\nshopping facilities. The performance of commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by\nconditions specific to the relevant industry, the real estate market for the property type and geographic\nregion where the property or borrower is located.\n• Construction and land - This category consists of loans to finance the ground-up construction and/or\nimprovement of construction of residential and commercial properties and loans secured by land. The\nperformance of construction and land loans is generally dependent upon the successful completion of\nimprovements and/or land development for the end user, the sale of the property to a third party, or a\nsecondary source of cash flow from the owners. The successful completion of planned improvements\nand development maybe adversely affected by changes in the estimated property value upon\ncompletion of construction, projected costs and other conditions leading to project delays.\n• Multi-family residential - This category consists of loans secured by apartment or residential buildings\nwith five or more units used to accommodate households on a temporary or permanent basis. The\nperformance of multi-family loans is generally dependent on the receipt of rental income from the\ntenants who occupy the subject property. The occupancy rate of the subject property and the ability of\nthe tenants to pay rent may be adversely affected by the location of the subject property and local\neconomic conditions.\n• Consumer - This category consists of loans to individuals for household, family and other personal use.\nThe performance of these loans may be adversely affected by national and local economic conditions,\nunemployment rates and other factors affecting the borrower's income available to service the debt.\nAll of our consumer loans are secured by our customers’ savings accounts and/or certificates of deposit.\nAs a result of the uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, management’s estimate of credit losses\nand the related allowance could change in the near term.\nBased on management’s periodic evaluation of the allowance for credit losses, a provision for credit\nlosses is charged to operations if additions to the allowance are required. Actual loan charge-offs are\ndeducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off loans are added to the\nallowance. Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities totaled $32,000 and $25,000\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\n18\nOther Real Estate\nReal estate properties acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure are held for sale and are initially\nrecorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. Any write-downs at the time of acquisition are charged to\nthe allowance for credit losses. Costs relating to development and improvement of property are\ncapitalized, whereas costs relating to holding property are expensed. At December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthere was no other real estate.\nSubsequent to acquisition, valuations are periodically performed by management to report these assets at\nthe lower of fair value less costs to sell or cost. Any adjustments resulting from these periodic re-\nevaluations of property are reflected in a valuation allowance and charged against income.\nPremises and Equipment\nLand is carried at cost. Buildings, leasehold improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment are carried\nat cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, respectively. Depreciation and amortization are\ncalculated on the straight-line basis and accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets\nwhich range from 3 to 39 years. Expenditures for improvements, which extend the life of an asset, are\ncapitalized and depreciated over the asset’s remaining useful life. Gains or losses realized on the disposition\nof properties and equipment are reflected in the statements of (loss) income. Expenditures for repairs and\nmaintenance are charged to operating expenses as incurred.\nLeases\nFASB ASC 842, Leases, establishes a right of use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU\nasset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. The\nCompany determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception based on whether the Company has\nthe right to control the asset during the contract period and other facts and circumstances. The Company\nelected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transitional guidance within the new\nstandard, which among other things, allowed it to carry forward the historical lease classification. Leases\nwith a term of less than 12 months will not record a right of use asset and liability and the payments will\nbe recognized into profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLife Insurance\nThe Company purchased life insurance on certain employees and directors of the Company. Appreciation in\nvalue of the insurance policies is included in noninterest income.\nAdvertising\nThe Company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expense as incurred. Advertising\nexpense was approximately $17,000 and $12,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, and is included in other non-interest expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with income tax guidance of FASB ASC 740,\nIncome Taxes, and has adopted the accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income\ntaxes, which sets forth a consistent framework to determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain\nfor uncertain tax positions.\n19\nThe income tax guidance results in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current\nincome tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of\nenacted tax law to the taxable income or excess deductions over revenues. The Company determines\ndeferred income taxes using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax\nasset or liability is based on the tax effects of the difference between the book and tax bases of assets and\nliabilities. Enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nDeferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax\nposition will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term more likely than not means a likelihood\nof more than 50 percent; the terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related\nappeals or litigation processes, if any. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition\nthreshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than\n50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all\nrelevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more likely than not\nrecognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date and\nis subject to management's judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on\nthe weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset\nwill not be realized.\nThe Company evaluates all significant tax positions as required by accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company does not believe that it\nhas taken any positions that would require the recording of any additional tax liability nor does it believe\nthat there are any unrealized tax benefits that would either increase or decrease within the next year.\nComprehensive Income\nThe Company reports comprehensive income in accordance with the accounting guidance related to FASB\nASC 220, Comprehensive Income. FASB ASC 220 establishes standards for reporting and presentation of\ncomprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial statements. Comprehensive income\nconsists of net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes net\nunrealized gains (losses) on securities and is presented, net of tax, in the statements of comprehensive (loss)\nincome.\nStatement of Cash Flows\nFor purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, due from\nbanks and deposits with the FHLB. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with original\nmaturities of three months or less (excluding interest-bearing deposits in banks) to be cash equivalents.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nThe Company records revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with ASU 2014-09, Revenue\nfrom Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Under Topic 606, the Company must identify the contract\nwith a customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price,\nallocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenue when,\nor as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Significant revenue has not been recognized in the\ncurrent reporting period that results from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods.\nThe Company’s primary sources of revenue are derived from interest, dividends and fees earned on loans,\n20\ndebt securities, and other financial instruments that are not within the scope of Topic 606. The Company\nhas evaluated the nature of its contracts with customers and determined that further disaggregation of\nrevenue from contracts with customers into more granular categories beyond what is presented in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income was not necessary. The Company generally fully satisfies its\nperformance obligations on its contracts with customers as services are rendered and the transaction prices\nare fixed. The Company has made no significant judgments in applying the revenue guidance prescribed in\nASC 606 that affect the determination of the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications may have been made to the 2022 financial statements to conform with the 2023\nfinancial statement presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on net income or retained earnings\nas previously reported.\nNote 2 – Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) represents income available or loss attributable to common shareholders\ndivided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding; no dilution for any potentially\nconvertible shares is included in the calculation. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur\nif securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or\nresulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company. The potential\ncommon shares that may be issued by the Company relate to outstanding stock options.\nEarnings per common share were computed based on the following:\nYear Ended De cem ber 31,\n(in thousands, except per share data) 2023 2022\nNumerator:\nNet (Loss) Income Available to Common Stockholders $ (206) $ 88\nDenominator:\nWeighted Average Common Shares Outstanding 1,026 1,074\nLess: Average Unallocated ESOP Shares 94 98\nWeighted Average Shares 932 976\nBasic Earnings Per Common Share $ (0.22) $ 0.09\nNote 3 - Debt Securities -\nThe amortized cost and fair values of debt securities available-for-sale were as follows:\nGross Gross\nDecember 31, 2023: Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair\n(in thousands) Cost Gains (Losses) Value\nMortgage-Backed Securities:\nFHLMC $ 1,697 $ — $ (236) $ 1,461\nSBA 7a Pools 3,015 3 (27) 2,991\nTotal Debt Securities Available-for-Sale $ 4,712 $ 3 $ (263) $ 4,452\n21\nGross Gross\nDecember 31, 2022: Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair\n(in thousands) Cost Gains (Losses) Value\nMortgage-Backed Securities:\nFHLMC $ 1,990 $ — $ (267) $ 1,723\nSBA 7a Pools 3,712 6 (24) 3,694\nTotal Debt Securities Available-for-Sale $ 5,702 $ 6 $ (291) $ 5,417\nAll debt securities held on December 31, 2023 and 2022 were government-sponsored mortgage-backed or\nSBA pool securities.\nThe amortized cost and fair values of the debt securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2023, by\ncontractual maturity, are shown below. For mortgage-backed securities and SBA 7a pools, expected\nmaturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay\nobligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\nAvailab le-f or -Sale\nDecember 31, 2023 Amortized Fair\n(in thousands) Cost Value\nAmounts Maturing:\nAfter One Year through Five Years $ 533 $ 531\nAfter Five Years through Ten Years 2,418 2,370\nAfter Ten Years 1,761 1,551\n$ 4,712 $ 4,452\nNo debt securities were pledged to secure advances from the FHLB as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThere were no sales or calls of available-for-sale debt securities for the years ended December 31, 2023 or\n2022.\nGross unrealized losses in debt securities at December 31, 2023 and 2022, existing for continuous periods of\nless than 12 months and for continuous periods of 12 months or more, were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in thousands) Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or More Totals\nSecurity Unrealized Unrealized Unrealized\nDescription Fair Value (Losses) Fair Value (Losses) Fair Value (Losses)\nMortgage-Backed\nFHLMC $ — $ — $ 1,461 $ (236) $ 1,461 $ (236)\nSBA 7a Pools — — 2,144 (27) 2,144 (27)\n$ — $ — $ 3,605 $ (263) $ 3,605 $ (263)\nDecember 31, 2022\n(in thousands) Less Than 12 Months 12 Months or More Totals\nSecurity Unrealized Unrealized Unrealized\nDescription Fair Value (Losses) Fair Value (Losses) Fair Value (Losses)\nMortgage-Backed\nFHLMC $ 945 $ (89) $ 778 $ (178) $ 1,723 $ (267)\nSBA 7a Pools 2,539 (24) — — 2,539 (24)\n$ 3,484 $ (113) $ 778 $ (178) $ 4,262 $ (291)\nAt December 31, 2023, approximately 87.9% of the securities in the investment portfolio reflect an\nunrealized loss. At December 31, 2023, eight debt securities with unrealized losses have declined\n22\napproximately 6.3% from cost basis. These unrealized losses relate principally to current interest rates for\nsimilar types of securities and not credit quality.\nUnder ASC 326, management evaluates available-for-sale securities in unrealized loss positions to\ndetermine if the decline in the fair value of each security below its amortized cost basis is due to credit-\nrelated factors or noncredit-related factors. Consideration is given to the extent to which that fair value is\nless than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of\nthe Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period sufficient to allow for any anticipated\nrecovery in fair value. At December 31, 2023, management does not have the intent to sell any of the\nCompany’s securities in an unrealized loss position and believes that it is more likely than not that the\nCompany will not have to sell any such securities before recovery of cost.\nPrior to the adoption of ASC 326, management evaluated securities for other-than-temporary impairment\nand, as of December 31, 2022, no declines in fair value were deemed to be other-than temporary. See\nNote 1 for more information on the adoption of ASC 326.\nNote 4 - Investment in FHLB Stock -\nThe Company maintains an investment in the membership stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of\nDallas. The carrying amount of this investment is stated at cost which was $1,545,000 and $1,469,000 at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company meets the\nrequired level of FHLB stock. The stock is pledged as collateral against the advances from the FHLB.\nNote 5 - Loans Receivable and the Allowance for Credit Losses -\nLoans receivable at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are summarized as follows:\nDe cember 31, De cember 31,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nMortgage Loans\n1-4 Family $ 80,238 $ 74,970\nMultifamily 2,519 3,025\nConstruction and Land 1,143 5,626\nCommercial Real Estate 1,380 1,431\nConsumer Loans 191 199\n85,471 85,251\nPlus (Less):\nUnamortized Loan Fees/Costs 1,382 1,443\nAllowance for Credit Losses (850) (850)\nNet Loans Receivable $ 86,003 $ 85,844\nThe performing mortgage loans are pledged, under a blanket lien, as collateral securing advances from\nthe FHLB at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nManagement segregates the loan portfolio into portfolio segments which is defined as the level at which\nthe Company develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit\nlosses. The portfolio segments are segregated based on loan types and the underlying risk factors present\nin each loan type. Such risk factors are periodically reviewed by management and revised as deemed\nappropriate. The following tables set forth, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the balance of the\nallowance for credit losses by portfolio segment, disaggregated by impairment methodology. The\nallowance for credit losses allocated to each portfolio segment is not necessarily indicative of future\n23\nlosses in any particular portfolio segment and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in\nother portfolio segments.\nAllowance for Credit Losses For the Year Ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands) under the CECL\nMethodology\nM ortgage- M ortgage-\nMortgage- Mortgage- Construction Commercial\n1-4 Family Multifamily and Land Real Estate Consumer Total\nAllowance for Credit Losses:\nBeginning Balance $ 762 $ 23 $ 44 $ 21 $ — $ 850\nCharge-Offs — — — — — —\nRecoveries — — — — — —\nProvision (Credit) 35 (4) (24) (7) — —\nEnding Balance $ 797 $ 19 $ 20 $ 14 $ — $ 850\nThe allowance for credit losses for Mortgage 1-4 Family Loans of $797,000 includes an unallocated portion\nof $190,000 as of December 31, 2023.\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Recorded Investment in Loans Receivable For the Year Ended December\n31, 2022 (in thousands) under the Incurred Loss Methodology\nM ortgage- M ortgage-\nMortgage- Mortgage- Construction Commercial\n1-4 Family Multifamily and Land Real Estate Consumer Total\nAllowance for Loan Losses:\nBeginning Balance $ 752 $ 21 $ 63 $ 22 $ — $ 858\nCharge-Offs — — — — — —\nRecoveries — — — — — —\nProvision (Credit) 10 2 (19) (1) — (8)\nEnding Balance $ 762 $ 23 $ 44 $ 21 $ — $ 850\nEnding Balance:\nIndividually Evaluated for Impairment $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCollectively Evaluated for Impairment $ 762 $ 23 $ 44 $ 21 $ — $ 850\nLoans Receivable:\nEnding Balance $ 74,970 $ 3,025 $ 5,626 $ 1,431 $ 199 $ 85,251\nEnding Balance:\nIndividually Evaluated for Impairment $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCollectively Evaluated for Impairment $ 74,970 $ 3,025 $ 5,626 $ 1,431 $ 199 $ 85,251\nThe allowance for loan losses for Mortgage 1-4 Family Loans of $762,000 includes an unallocated portion\nof $464,000 as of December 31, 2022.\nManagement further disaggregates the loan portfolio segments into classes of loans, which are based on\nthe initial measurement of the loan, risk characteristics of the loan and the method for monitoring and\nassessing the credit risk of the loan.\nLoan Grades / Classification\nThe primary purpose of grading loans is to assess credit quality and assist in identifying potential problem\nloans. Every loan in the portfolio is assigned a loan grade based on quality and level of risk. Loan grades\n24\nare updated as events occur that bear on the collectability of the loan, such as change in payment flow or\nstatus of the obligor or collateral. Changes in loan grades are reported to the Board Loan Committee.\nEach credit reviewed is assigned a loan grade based on the following system:\nLoan Grade 1 Pass – Good\nLoans with no identified problems and do not require more than normal attention. The repayment source\nis well defined and the borrower/guarantor exhibits no inability of repaying the loan as agreed. The\nfinancial information is acceptable and the loan meets credit and policy requirements and exhibits no\nunusual elements of risk. The collateral is acceptable and adequate.\nLoan Grade 2 Pass – Fair\nThese are performing owner-occupied loans that exhibit diminished borrower capacity, such as\nsufficiently-aged loans that are modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty or loans that are\nfrequently delinquent more than 30 days but less than 60 days. Also included are performing investor\nloans with a good payment record but lack updated financial information but are judged from alternate\nsources to have satisfactory cash flows and a sufficiently strong guarantor.\nLoan Grade 3 Watch\nOwner-occupied loans that are well-secured but are occasionally delinquent more than 60 days but less\nthan 90. Also included are performing investor loans lacking required current financial information or that\ndemonstrate diminished guarantor capacity and an estimated stressed debt service coverage ratio of less\nthan 1.20.\nLoan Grade 4 Special Mention (For investment loans only.)\nInvestment loans that have potential or identified weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention.\nIf left uncorrected, these may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the\ninstitution’s credit position at some future date. These loans are not adversely classified and do not expose\nthe institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. Default is not imminent.\nAdverse Classifications\nLoan Grade 5 Substandard\nA loan that is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of\nthe collateral pledge, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that\njeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company\nwill sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.

To provide financial\nassistance and liquidity to taxpayers during the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act amended the\nfederal income tax rules with regard to the usage of net operating losses (“NOLs”) for corporate\ntaxpayers. The CARES Act allows for the carryback of losses arising in a taxable year beginning after\nDecember 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021, to be carried back to each of the five taxable years\npreceding the taxable year of the loss. The CARES Act also temporarily repeals the 80% limitation for\nNOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and beginning before January 1, 2021 and\ncarried to another tax year. These NOLs are now permitted to fully offset the loss corporation’s pre-2021\ntaxable income. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Eureka Homestead Bancorp and\nSubsidiary generated $279,000 and $137,000 federal net operating losses, respectively. Losses prior to\n2021 were available to carry back to previous tax years and the remaining amounts totaling $2.0 million\nare available for future use. Although these net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date, we\nbelieve that it is more likely than not that the benefit from a portion of the net operating loss\ncarryforwards will not be realized within a reasonable time period. In recognition of this risk, we have\nprovided a valuation adjustment of $308,000 on the deferred tax asset related to these net operating loss\ncarryforwards. If or when recognized, the tax benefits related to any reversal of the valuation allowance\non the deferred tax asset will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense and an increase in\nequity. Neither Eureka Homestead nor Eureka Homestead Bancorp generated any net operating loss\ncarryforwards for Louisiana.\nRetained earnings at December 31, 2023 and 2022, include approximately $3,986,000 for which no deferred\nincome tax liability has been recognized. These amounts represent an allocation of income to bad debt\ndeductions for tax purposes only. Reduction of amounts so allocated for purposes other than tax bad debt\nlosses or adjustments arising from carry back of net operating losses would create income for tax purposes\nonly, which would be subject to the then current corporate income tax rate. The unrecorded deferred\nincome tax liability on the above amount was approximately $837,000 at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n30\nThe Small Business Protection Act of 1996 repealed Internal Revenue Code Section 593, which had\nallowed thrifts to use the percentage of income method as an alternative for computing their tax bad debt\ndeductions. This act required small thrifts to change their method of computing reserves for bad debts to the\nexperience method in accordance with the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 585. The repeal\nwas effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995. The Company implemented this change\nfor the year ended December 31, 1996. As a result of the change, the Company is required to recapture the\nexcess of the thrift’s qualifying and non-qualifying bad debt reserves as of December 31, 1995 over its\ncontracted base year reserves. The Company had no excess amounts subject to recapture.\nIn management’s opinion, the reversal of temporary differences and the results of the future operations will\ngenerate sufficient earnings to realize the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2023 after taking into account\nthe valuation reserves.\nNote 9 - Deposits -\nDeposits at December 31 are summarized below (in thousands):\n20 23 20 22\nAmount % Amount %\nPassbook Savings $ 1,823 2.8 $ 3,357 5.4\nMoney Market Accounts 158 0.2 183 0.3\nCertificates of Deposit 63,210 97.0 58,680 94.3\n$ 65,191 100.0 $ 62,220 100.0\nThe weighted average interest rate on deposits at December 31, 2023 and 2022, was 2.33% and 1.51%,\nrespectively.\nScheduled maturities and average interest rates of certificates of deposit at December 31, 2023 are\nsummarized as follows (in thousands):\nAverage\nInterest\nAmount Rate %\n2024 $ 17,851 2.817 %\n2025 17,978 1.772 %\n2026 12,642 1.859 %\n2027 10,018 3.138 %\n2028 2,280 3.761 %\nThereafter 2,441 2.283 %\n$ 63,210 2.392 %\nThe aggregate amount of time deposits with a denomination of greater than $250,000 was approximately\n$4,107,000 and $3,547,000 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, these credit facilities were\nunused. To date, no debt securities have been pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank.\nNote 11 - Employee Benefit Plans -\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company sponsors a 401(k) profit sharing plan. Substantially all employees 21 years of age or older\nwho have at least six months of service and have worked 1,000 hours during the year may participate in the\nplan through salary deferral contributions subject to the plan provisions. The Company makes matching\ncontributions based on a percentage of each participant’s contribution and may also make discretionary\ncontributions to the plan. The Company matched 100% of the participant’s salary deferral contribution up\nto 3% and 50% of the participant’s salary deferral contribution of the next 2% of the participant’s annual\ncompensation for 2023 and 2022. The Company’s contributions to the plan were approximately $43,000\nand $52,000 for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n32\nPension Plan\nThe Company sponsors a defined contribution pension plan. Substantially all employees 21 years of age or\nolder who have at least one year of service and are employed on the last day of the year may participate in\nthe plan. The Company contributed 5.4% of the participant’s annual compensation to the plan for 2023 and\n2022. The Company’s contributions to the plan were approximately $63,000 and $80,000 for 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nThe employees vest in the employer’s contributions 20% a year after the first year in the plans and are fully\nvested at the completion of six years of service. The maximum combined employer contribution to both the\n401(k) plan and the pension plan is 25% of the total annual compensation paid to each participant.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan\nAs part of the Company's stock conversion in 2019, an employee stock ownership plan (\"ESOP\") for\neligible employees was established. The leveraged ESOP is accounted for in accordance with the\nrequirements of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. All employees of the Bank meeting\ncertain tenure requirements are entitled to participate in the ESOP.\nShares were purchased by the ESOP with a loan from Eureka Homestead Bancorp, Inc. The ESOP\nacquired 114,374 shares of the Company's common stock in the conversion. During each of the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, 4,575 shares were allocated to ESOP plan participants, leaving\n91,499 unallocated shares in the ESOP at December 31, 2023. Compensation expense related to the\nESOP was $62,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $70,000 for the year ended December\n31, 2022.\nThe stock price at the formation date was $10.00. The aggregate fair value of the 91,499 unallocated\nshares was $1,551,000 based on the $16.95 closing price of the common stock on December 31,\n2023.\nUnder ASC 718, unearned ESOP shares are not considered outstanding and are shown as a reduction\nof stockholders' equity as unearned compensation. Dividends on unallocated ESOP shares are\nconsidered to be compensation expense. The Company recognizes compensation cost equal to the\nfair value of the ESOP shares during the periods in which they are committed to be released. To the\nextent that the fair value of the Company's ESOP shares differ from the cost of such shares, the\ndifferential is credited to stockholders' equity. The Company receives a tax deduction equal to the\ncost of the shares released. As the loan is internally leveraged, the loan receivable from the ESOP to\nthe Company is not reported as an asset nor is the debt of the ESOP shown as a Company liability.\nThe compensation expense resulting from the release of the common stock from the suspense account and\nallocation to plan participants results in a corresponding reduction in the earnings of Eureka Homestead\nBancorp.\nEquity Incentive Plan\nIn August 2020, the Company's stockholders authorized the adoption of the 2020 Eureka Homestead\nBancorp, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan” or the “Plan”). No more than 200,154 shares of the\nCompany's common stock may be issued under the Plan, of which a maximum of 142,967 may be issued\npursuant to the exercise of stock options and 57,187 may be issued pursuant to restricted stock awards,\nrestricted stock units and unrestricted share awards. Stock options awarded to employees may be\n33\nincentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. The shares that may be issued may be authorized\nbut unissued shares or treasury shares. The Plan permits the grant of incentive awards in the form of\noptions, stock appreciation rights, restricted share and share unit awards, and performance share awards.\nThe 2020 Plan contains limits on certain types of awards to individual participants.\nAwards may vest or become exercisable only upon the achievement of performance measures or based\nsolely on the passage of time after award. Stock options and restricted stock awards provide for\naccelerated vesting upon death, disability or if there is an involuntary termination of service following a\nchange in control (as defined in the Plan).\nOn December 21, 2021, the Company made a grant of restricted shares for 3,225 shares, to a member of\nManagement. The award vests over a three-year period.\nRestricted Shares\nRestricted shares are accounted for as fixed grants using the fair value of the Company's stock at the time\nof the grant. Unvested restricted shares may not be disposed of or transferred during the vesting period.\nThe table below presents the restricted stock award activity for the period shown:\nW eighted Average\nRestricted Fair Value at\nStock Awards Grant Date\nNon-vested at January 1, 2023 2,150 $ 13.95\nGranted — —\nVested (1,075) 13.95\nForfeited — —\nNon-vested at December 31, 2023 1,075 $ 13.95\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $15,000 of unrecognized compensation expense related to\nrestricted shares, having recognized $15,000 of compensation expense in each of the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. The cost of the restricted shares will be amortized in monthly installments\nover the three-year vesting period\nOther Retirement Agreements\nThe Company has entered into retirement agreements with certain directors. Under the director agreements,\nafter ten years in the plan and attaining the age of 75, the Company is to provide to each director the sum of\n$120,000 payable over a period of 10 years. (This benefit would be paid to the director’s beneficiaries in a\nlump sum upon the director’s death.).\nThe estimated present value of future benefits to be paid is being accrued over the period from the effective\ndate of the agreements until the dates payments are expected to expire. The expense incurred for this plan\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, amounted to approximately $25,000 and $28,000,\nrespectively. The accrued liability at December 31, 2023 and 2022, amounted to approximately $260,000\nand $297,000, respectively.\nThe Company is the beneficiary of life insurance policies, with death benefits totaling approximately\n$7,123,000 and $7,246,000 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively that have been purchased as a\nmethod of financing benefits under the agreements.\n34\nIn 2023 the Company received a net benefit of approximately $25,000 due to the death of one of the\ndirectors. This benefit was recorded in service charges and other income in the Income Statement for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023.\nSplit Dollar Life Insurance\nThe Company entered into a split dollar life insurance agreement on March 1, 2019 with each of Messrs.\nHaskins and Heintzen to recognize the valuable services of the executives and to encourage them to\ncontinue in service with the Company. The split-dollar agreements divide the death proceeds of certain\nlife insurance policies owned by the Company on the lives of the executives with their designated\nbeneficiaries. The Company paid the life insurance premiums on the policies from its general assets.\nUnder the agreements, Messrs. Haskins and Heintzen or their assignees have the right to designate the\nbeneficiary an amount of death proceeds. Upon either executive’s death, his beneficiary will be entitled\nto a benefit equal to the lesser of $700,000 or the net death proceeds from the policies. The net death\nproceeds portion is the total death proceeds paid under the policy less the greater of the policy’s cash\nsurrender value or the aggregate premiums paid by the Company on the policy. Each executive’s interest\nin the split-dollar agreement terminates under certain circumstances, including the executive’s cessation\nof all service with the Company.\nNote 12 - Regulatory Matters -\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by its primary Federal\nregulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Failure to meet the minimum capital\nrequirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators\nthat, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank and the financial statements. Under\nthe regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the\nBank must meet specific capital guidelines involving quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets,\nliabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory reporting requirements. The\nBank’s capital amounts and classification under the prompt corrective action guidelines are also subject\nto qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain\nminimum amounts and ratios as of January 1, 2015, of total capital, tier 1 capital, and common equity tier\n1 capital to risk-weighted assets (as defined in the regulations), and leverage capital, which is tier 1\ncapital to adjusted average total assets (as defined). Management believes, as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, that the Bank meets all the capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the most recent notifications from the OCC categorized the Bank as\nwell capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To remain categorized as\nwell capitalized, the Bank will have to maintain minimum total capital, common equity tier 1 capital, tier\n1 capital, and leveraged capital ratios as disclosed in the table below. There are no conditions or events\n35\nsince the most recent notification that management believes have changed the Bank’s category.

Such\nloans were made on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions\nwith other persons.\n36\nActivity in loans to directors and officers is as follows:\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nBalance at Beginning of Year $ 126 $ 130\nAdd: New Loans or Advances 575 —\nLess: Payments (580) (4)\nBalance at End of Year $ 121 $ 126\nThe Company also has accepted deposits from certain directors and officers. Such deposits were accepted\non substantially the same terms as those of other depositors and amounted to approximately $715,000 and\n$692,000 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNote 14 - Leases\nThe Company recognizes a ROU asset and lease liability of approximately $13,000 and $64,000 at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are reflected in Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets and\nAccrued Expenses and Other Liabilities, respectively.\nIn 2009, the Company entered into an operating lease pertaining to property used for a loan production\noffice. The lease had an original term of three years, beginning April 15, 2009 and expiring March 31, 2012,\nwith the option to extend the lease for six additional three-year periods. The Company exercised this option\nonly through March 31, 2024.\nLease payments per the agreement are approximately $4,000 per month and increase at each renewal period\nthe greater of 10% or the Consumer Price index (CPI). Lease payments that were applied to the lease\nliability totaled approximately $51,000. The weighted-average remaining lease term in years is 0.25. The\nweighted average discount rate is 5.07%.\nTotal rental expense was approximately $53,000 and $53,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nA maturity analysis of the lease liability and reconciliation of the undiscounted cash flows to the lease\nliability is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, Amount\n(in thousands)\n2024 $ 13\n2025 —\nTotal Undiscounted Cash Flows 13\nDiscount on Cash Flows —\nTotal Lease Liability $ 13\nNote 15 – Commitments and Contingencies –\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has various outstanding commitments that are not reflected\nin the accompanying financial statements.\nOn January 1, 2023 and at adoption of ASC 326, the Company did not record any allowance for credit\nlosses on unfunded lending commitments. Refer to Note 1 for more information on the adoption of ASC\n326. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments is recorded within Accrued\n37\nExpenses and Other Liabilities on the Balance Sheets. There was no related provision for credit losses for\nunfunded lending commitments recorded with the provision for credit losses and reported in aggregate as\nthe provision for credit losses on the Statements of (Loss) Income. At December 31, 2023, there was no\nallowance for credit losses for unfunded lending commitments. Total unfunded lending commitments\namounted to $438,000 and $3.4 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nNote 16 - Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk -\nIn the normal course of business, the Company has outstanding commitments, such as commitments to\nextend credit, which are not included in the accompanying financial statements. The Company’s exposure\nto credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for\ncommitments to extend credit and standby letters is represented by the contractual or notional amount of\nthose instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making such commitments as it does for\ninstruments that are included in the Balance Sheets.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any\ncondition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other\ntermination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company evaluates each customer’s\ncreditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the\nCompany upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation.\nAt December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had $438,000 and $3.4 million of\noutstanding commitments to originate loans, respectively, all of which represent the balance of remaining\nfunds to be disbursed on construction loans in process. In recent years we have sold loans on an industry-\nstandard, servicing-released basis. At December 31, 2023, there were mortgage loans sold to investors\nwith limited recourse for certain periods after the date of sale totaling $1.5 million at the sale date.\nRecourse would apply if the borrower(s) default on any payment within the first four months of the\nmortgage loan and it remains in default for a period of 90 days, or if the mortgage loan prepays in full\nwithin 180 days of the sale date. Should an early payment default occur, the Company shall, at its sole\ndiscretion, repurchase such mortgage loan from the purchaser at its current amortized balance plus the\nservice release premium received or indemnify the purchaser by paying the service release premium\nreceived plus $5,000. Should a mortgage loan prepay in full within 180 days of the sale date, the\nCompany shall refund to the purchaser the servicing release premium paid. There have been no mortgage\nloans sold that had an early payment default or that prepaid in full during the recourse period.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of\nmanagement and counsel, the disposition or ultimate resolution of such proceedings would not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company's financial statements.\nNote 17 - Significant Concentration of Credit Risk –\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides insurance coverage under defined limits. The\nCompany maintains cash balances at various financial institutions which may periodically exceed the\nfederally insured amount.\nMost of the Company’s lending activity is represented by loans receivable secured principally by first\nmortgages on real estate located within Louisiana. Additionally, the substantial portion of the real estate\nupon which the Company has extended credit is on residential properties; however, the Company has\nextended credit on non-residential properties.\n38\nNote 18 - Fair Values of Financial Instruments -\nFair Value Disclosures\nThe Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities\nand to determine fair value disclosures. In accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, the\nfair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is best\ndetermined based on quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices\nfor the Company's various financial instruments.\nIn cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are significantly affected by the\nassumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, fair value\nestimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.\nThe fair value accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation\ntechniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices\nin active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under this\nguidance are described below.\nLevel 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that\nthe reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market for the asset or\nliability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and\nvolume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2 - Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable\nfor the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include the following:\na. Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\nb. Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, that is,\nmarkets in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current,\nor price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers (for example,\nsome brokered markets), or in which little information is released publicly (for example, a\nprincipal-to principal market);\nc. Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (for example,\ninterest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities,\nprepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default rates); and\nd. Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by\ncorrelation or other means (market-corroborated inputs).\nLevel 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be\nused to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for\nsituations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.\nTherefore, unobservable inputs shall reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the assumptions\nthat market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk).\nUnobservable inputs shall be developed based on the best information available in the circumstances,\nwhich might include the reporting entity's own data.\n39\nHowever, the reporting entity's own data used to develop unobservable inputs shall be adjusted if\ninformation is reasonably available without undue cost and effort that indicates that market participants\nwould use different assumptions.\nA financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input\nthat is significant to the fair value measurement.\nRecurring Basis\nFair values of debt securities were primarily measured using information from a third-party pricing\nservice. This pricing service provides information by utilizing evaluated pricing models supported with\nmarket data information. Standard inputs include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes,\nissuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data from market research publications.\nThe following tables present the balances of assets measured on a recurring basis as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022. The Company did not record any liabilities at fair value for which measurement of the\nfair value was made on a recurring basis.\nFa ir Value at Re por ti ng Date Usin g\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets Other Significant\nfor Identical Observable Unobservable\nDecember 31, 2023: Fair Assets Inputs Inputs\n(in thousands) Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nMortgage-Backed Securities\nFHLMC $ 1,461 $ — $ 1,461 $ —\nSBA 7a Pools 2,991 — 2,991 —\nTotal Debt Securities $ 4,452 $ — $ 4,452 $ —\nFa ir Value at Re por ti ng Date Usin g\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets Other Significant\nfor Identical Observable Unobservable\nDecember 31, 2022: Fair Assets Inputs Inputs\n(in thousands) Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nMortgage-Backed Securities\nFHLMC $ 1,723 $ — $ 1,723 $ —\nSBA 7a Pools 3,694 — 3,694 —\nTotal Debt Securities $ 5,417 $ — $ 5,417 $ —\nNon-recurring Basis\nThe Company has segregated all financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-\nrecurring basis into the most appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to\ndetermine the fair value at the measurement date in the table below. The Company did not record any\nliabilities at fair value for which measurement of the fair value was made on a non-recurring basis.\nThe fair value of the impaired loans is measured at the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent\nloans. Impaired loans are Level 2 assets measured using appraisals from external parties of the collateral\nless any prior liens. Repossessed assets are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell.\n40\nThe fair value of repossessed assets is based on property appraisals and an analysis of similar properties\navailable. As such, the Company records repossessed assets as Level 2.\nFa ir Value at Re por ti ng Date Usin g\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets Other Significant\nfor Identical Observable Unobservable\nDecember 31, 2023: Fair Assets Inputs Inputs\n(in thousands) Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nImpaired Loans $ — $ — $ — $ —\nOther Real Estate — — — —\nTotal $ — $ — $ — $ —\nFa ir Value at Re por ti ng Date Usin g\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets Other Significant\nfor Identical Observable Unobservable\nDecember 31, 2022: Fair Assets Inputs Inputs\n(in thousands) Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nImpaired Loans $ — $ — $ — $ —\nOther Real Estate — — — —\nTotal $ — $ — $ — $ —\nFASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of fair value information about financial\ninstruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet.\nIn cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value\nor other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used,\nincluding the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. The derived fair value estimates cannot be\nsubstantiated through comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in\nimmediate settlement of the instrument. FASB ASC 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all non-\nfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Further, the disclosures do not include estimated fair\nvalues for items which are not financial instruments but which represent significant value to the Company,\nincluding core deposit intangibles and other fee-generating operations of the business. Reasonable\ncomparability of fair value estimates between financial institutions may not be possible due to the wide\nrange of permitted valuation techniques and numerous assumptions involved. The aggregate fair value\namounts presented do not, and are not intended to, represent an aggregate measure of the underlying fair\nvalue of the Company.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial\ninstruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:\nCash and Cash Equivalents - For those short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable\nestimate of fair value.\nInterest-Bearing Deposits - The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.\n41\nDebt securities - For debt securities, fair value equals quoted market price, if available. If a quoted\nmarket price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities.\nLoans - The fair value of loans is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using the interest rates\nat which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining\nmaturities.\nLoans Held-for-Sale - The loans held-for sale are recorded at the lower of aggregate cost or market value\nwhich is a reasonable estimate of fair value.\nFHLB Stock - The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.\nCash Surrender Value of Life Insurance - The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.\nAccrued Interest Receivable and Accrued Interest Payable - The carrying amounts of accrued interest\nreceivable and accrued interest payable approximate the fair values.\nDeposits - The fair value of savings accounts and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on\ndemand at the reporting date (carrying value). The fair value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit is\nestimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered for\ndeposits of similar remaining maturities.\nAdvances from the FHLB - The fair values of the Advances from the FHLB are estimated using\ndiscounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar\ntypes of borrowing arrangements.\nLoan Commitments - For commitments to extend credit, fair value considers the difference between\ncurrent levels of interest rates and the committed rates.\nThe estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments were as follows as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022 (in thousands):\nDecemb er 3 1 , 2023 Decemb er 3 1 , 2022\nCarrying Fair Carrying Fair\nAmount Value Amount Value\nFinancial Assets:\nCash and Cash Equivalents $ 2,253 $ 2,253 $ 3,650 $ 3,650\nInterest-Bearing Deposits in Banks 5,493 5,493 1,249 1,249\nDebt Securities, Available for Sale 4,452 4,452 5,417 5,417\nLoans - Net 86,003 79,937 85,844 77,483\nLoans Held-for-Sale — — — —\nAccrued Interest Receivable 492 492 453 453\nFHLB Stock 1,545 1,545 1,469 1,469\nCash Surrender Value of Life Insurance 4,303 4,303 4,312 4,312\nFinancial Liabilities:\nDeposits 65,191 62,289 62,220 60,756\nAdvances from FHLB 19,270 18,707 19,744 18,622\nAccrued Interest Payable 50 50 40 40\nThe carrying amounts in the preceding table are included in the balance sheet under the applicable captions;\naccrued interest payable is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the balance sheet.

(“EIG”), a newly formed corporation headed by experienced bank investors, to be acquired\nby EIG.\nThe Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously adopted by the boards of the Company and Eureka\nInvestor Group, provides for cash merger consideration equal to $13.0 million. In addition, immediately\nprior to closing the Company will be permitted, subject to regulatory approval, to pay a dividend equal to\nan amount by which the Company’s adjusted tangible shareholders’ equity, as defined in the Merger\nAgreement, exceeds $10.0 million. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company’s adjusted\ntangible shareholders’ equity is generally defined as the Company’s GAAP equity prior to closing subject\nto negative adjustments for, among other items, transaction expenses and certain allowance for credit\nlosses adjustments.\nThe transaction was approved by the Company’s shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders on\nFebruary 21, 2024 and is pending regulatory approvals from the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. It is anticipated that this transaction\nwill close in the second or third quarter of 2024.\nTransaction-related expenses totaled approximately $386,000 and $133,000 for the years ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNote 21 – Change in Corporate Form -\nOn July 9, 2019, Eureka Homestead (the “Bank”) converted to a federal stock savings and loan\nassociation and established a stock holding company, Eureka Homestead Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”),\nas parent of the Bank.\nIn connection with the conversion, the Bank issued all of its common stock to the Company, becoming\nthe wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company issued and sold shares of its capital stock\npursuant to an independent valuation appraisal of the Bank and the Company. The stock was priced at\n$10.00 per share. In addition, the Bank’s board of directors adopted an employee stock ownership plan\n(ESOP) which subscribed for 8% of the common stock sold in the offering. The Conversion was\ncompleted on July 9, 2021 and resulted in the issuance of 1,429,676 common shares by the Company.\nThe cost of the Conversion and issuing the capital stock totaled $1.2 million and was deducted from the\nproceeds of the offering.\nIn accordance with OCC regulations, at the time of the Conversion, the Bank substantially restricted\nretained earnings by establishing a liquidation account. The liquidation account will be maintained for the\nbenefit of eligible account holders who continue to maintain their accounts at the Bank after the\nConversion. The liquidation account will be reduced annually to the extent that eligible holders have\nreduced their qualifying deposits. Subsequent increases will not restore an eligible account holder’s\ninterest in the liquidation account. In the event of a complete liquidation by the Bank, and only in such\nevent, each eligible account holder will be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account\n43\nin an amount proportionate to the adjusted qualifying account balances then held. The Bank may not pay\ndividends if those dividends would reduce equity capital below the required liquidation account amount.\nThe Conversion was accounted for as a change in corporate form with the historic basis of the Bank’s\nassets, liabilities and equity unchanged as a result.\nNote 22 - Condensed Financial Information (Parent Company Only) -\nPresented below is condensed financial information as to the financial position, results of operations and\ncash flows of the Parent Company:\nCONDENSED BALANCE SHEETS\nDECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(in thousands)\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCash in Bank $ 286 $ 265\nInvestment in Subsidiary 18,957 19,066\nOther Assets 27 19\nTotal Assets $ 19,270 $ 19,350\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nLiabilities $ 64 $ 35\nShareholders' Equity 19,206 19,315\nTotal Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity $ 19,270 $ 19,350\nCONDENSED STATEMENTS OF (LOSS) INCOME\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2023\n(in thousands)\n2023 2022\nIncome:\nEquity in Net Income of Subsidiary $ 309 $ 380\nTotal Income 309 380\nExpenses:\nProfessional Fees 412 175\nOther Expense 161 158\nTotal Expenses 573 333\n(Loss) Income Before Income Tax (Benefit) (264) 47\nIncome Tax (Benefit) (58) (41)\nNet (Loss) Income $ (206) $ 88\n44\nCONDENSED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(in thousands)\n2023 2022\nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\nNet (Loss) Income $ (206) $ 88\nAdjustments to Reconcile Net Income to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:\nCash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities:\nNon-cash Compensation for ESOP 77 81\nDecrease in Equity in Net Income of Subsidiary 129 169\n(Increase) in Other Assets (8) (19)\nIncrease in Liabilities 29 8\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities 21 327\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\nNet Cash from Investing Activities — —\nCash Flows from Financing Activities:\nShares Repurchased — (2,450)\nNet Cash (Used in) Financing Activities — (2,450)\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents 21 (2,123)\nCash and Cash Equivalents at Beginning of Period 265 2,388\nCash and Cash Equivalents at End of Period $ 286 $ 265\n45"

          "content": "MERGER PROPOSED — YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT\nDear Fellow Stockholder:\nEureka Homestead Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company or “Eureka Homestead Bancorp”) has entered into an Agreement and\nPlan of Merger, dated as of August 3, 2023, by and among Eureka Investor Group Inc. (the “Investor Group”), Eureka Acquisition\nCorp. (“Acquisition Corp.”), and Eureka Homestead Bancorp (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which Acquisition Corp.,\nwill merge with and into Eureka Homestead Bancorp (the “merger”), with Eureka Homestead Bancorp as the surviving\ncorporation. Pursuant to the merger, Eureka Homestead Bancorp will become the wholly owned subsidiary of the Investor\nGroup.\nUpon completion of the merger, you will no longer own any stock or have any other interest in Eureka Homestead\nBancorp. The aggregate consideration for the merger is $13.0 million, subject to adjustment as provided in the Merger\nAgreement. If the Company’s closing tangible book value, as defined in the merger agreement, is less than $10.0 million on the\ncalculation date, the merger consideration will be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between $10.0 million and the\nclosing tangible book value on the calculation date. In addition, immediately prior to or at closing, Eureka Homestead Bancorp\nwill be permitted, subject to regulatory approval, to pay a dividend equal to an amount by which Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s\nclosing tangible book value exceeds $10.0 million. Based on Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s adjusted tangible shareholders’\nequity as of the date of this proxy statement as calculated pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Eureka Homestead\nBancorp stockholders are currently estimated to receive between $20.00 and $22.00 per share for their shares of Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp common stock. However, the estimated per share price range is subject to significant adjustment based on\na variety of factors, including, but not limited to, transaction costs and allowance for credit losses adjustments, either of which\ncould affect the amount of our special dividend to shareholders at closing. As a result, stockholders should not assume that the\nper share consideration they will receive upon closing of the merger will be within this range.\nYour exchange of shares of Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock for cash generally will cause you to recognize\nincome or loss for federal, and possibly state, local and foreign, income tax purposes. You should consult your personal tax\nadvisor for a full understanding of the income tax consequences of the merger to you.\nWe cordially invite you to attend a special meeting of stockholders of Eureka Homestead Bancorp, Inc. (the\n“Company” or “Eureka Homestead Bancorp”). The special meeting will be held at the office of Eureka Homestead located at\n1922 Veterans Memorial Boulevard, Metairie, Louisiana 70005, on Wednesday, February 21, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., local time.\nAt the special meeting, you will be asked to approve: (1) the Merger Agreement and the merger; and (2) any\nadjournment or postponement of the special meeting, if deemed necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there\nare not sufficient votes represented in person or by proxy at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Agreement\nand the merger (the “Adjournment Proposal”). A majority of the outstanding shares of Eureka Homestead Bancorp common\nstock must vote in favor of the Merger Agreement and the merger for the merger to be completed. If the Merger Agreement\nand the merger are approved, and all other conditions described in the Merger Agreement have been met or waived, the merger\nis expected to close during the second or third quarter of 2024.\nOur board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” approval of the Merger Agreement and\nthe merger and the Adjournment Proposal, because we believe that the merger is advisable and in the best interests of\nEureka Homestead Bancorp’s stockholders.\nThis proxy statement provides you with detailed information about the merger and includes, as Appendix A, a copy of\nthe Merger Agreement. We urge you to read the enclosed materials carefully for a complete description of the merger.\nYour vote is important.

The full text of the opinion, which describes the procedures followed, assumptions\nmade, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Performance Trust in\npreparing the opinion, is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement.

These conditions include, among others:\n(cid:120) obtaining the consents and approvals required to consummate the merger, including the approval\nof the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby by Eureka Homestead\nBancorp’s stockholders, the receipt of required regulatory approvals to consummate the\ntransactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the expiration of applicable waiting\nperiods;\n(cid:120) the Investor Group has satisfactorily completed the Capital Raise;\n(cid:120) the closing tangible book value (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of Eureka Homestead\nBancorp as of the calculation date must be at least $10.0 million;\n(cid:120) the absence of any judgment, order or injunction, statute, rule or regulation preventing the\nconsummation of the merger or making the consummation of the merger illegal;\n(cid:120) the absence of any condition or restriction imposed by a regulatory authority that would (i)\nreasonably be expected to be materially burdensome on, or impair in any material respect the\nbenefits of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to the Investor Group or\nEureka Homestead Bancorp; (ii) require a material modification of, or impose any material\nlimitation or restriction on, the proposed businesses of Eureka Homestead; (iii) require any person\nother than the Investor Group or the surviving corporation to guaranty, support or maintain the\ncapital of Eureka Homestead after the closing date; or (iv) require any contribution of capital to\nEureka Homestead Bancorp or Eureka Homestead at the closing beyond the Capital Raise\nproceeds;\n(cid:120) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties in the Merger Agreement as of the\nclosing date of the merger, subject to the materiality standards provided in the Merger Agreement,\nand the performance of the parties in all material respects of all obligations required to be\nperformed by each of them at or before the effective time of the merger under the Merger\nAgreement;\n(cid:120) delivery of a release by each person serving as a director of Eureka Homestead to the Investor\nGroup;\n(cid:120) delivery of certain certificates and transaction agreements to the Investor Group; and\n3\n(cid:120) the absence of any fact, change, event, occurrence, condition or development that has or would\nreasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Eureka Homestead Bancorp or\nEureka Homestead.\nWe cannot be certain when, or if, the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived, or that the\nmerger will be completed.\nThere are Regulatory Approvals That Must Be Received for the Merger to Occur (page 32)\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, the merger cannot be completed unless the parties first obtain\nthe approvals of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) and the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). The Investor Group has filed the required regulatory\napplications with the Federal Reserve Board and Eureka Homestead and the Investor Group have filed the required\napplication with the OCC. Although we do not know of any reason why the regulatory approvals would not be\nobtained in a timely manner, we cannot be certain when or if such approvals will be obtained.\nThe Merger Will Be Taxable to Eureka Homestead Bancorp Stockholders for U.S. Federal Income Tax\nPurposes (page 28)\nThe receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for shares of Eureka Homestead Bancorp common\nstock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and may be a\ntaxable transaction under applicable state, local and foreign income or other tax laws). For U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, each Eureka Homestead Bancorp stockholder generally will recognize gain or loss at the effective time of\nthe merger equal to the per share difference, if any, between: (1) the per share merger consideration and (2) the\nstockholder’s adjusted tax basis in each share of Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock exchanged in the\nmerger. The federal income tax consequences described above may not apply to all holders of Eureka Homestead\nBancorp common stock. Your tax consequences will depend on your individual situation. Accordingly, you\nshould consult your tax advisor for a full understanding of the particular tax consequences of the merger to you.\n4\nEUREKA HOMESTEAD BANCORP\nSELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA\nPresented below is certain selected consolidated financial data for Eureka Homestead Bancorp.

As a result, abstentions and broker\nnon-votes will have the same effect as votes “against” the approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger.\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the special\nmeeting. Broker non-votes and abstentions from voting will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on either\nproposal.\nApproval of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders is a condition to completion of the merger.

We encourage all stockholders to read the Merger Agreement. All information\ncontained in this proxy statement with respect to the Investor Group and the Acquisition Corp. has been supplied by\nthe Investor Group for inclusion herein and has not been independently verified by Eureka Homestead Bancorp.\nGeneral\nAs soon as possible after the conditions to consummation of the merger described herein have been\nsatisfied or waived, and unless the Merger Agreement has been terminated as discussed herein, Acquisition Corp.,\nthe merger subsidiary of the Investor Group, will merge with and into Eureka Homestead Bancorp, with Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp as the surviving corporation, and, at the closing, each of the outstanding shares of Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp common stock will be converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration,\nwhich is estimated to be between $20.00 and $22.00, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Merger\nAgreement. As a result of the merger, Eureka Homestead Bancorp will become the direct wholly owned subsidiary\nof the Investor Group and Eureka Homestead will become the indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Investor\nGroup.\nBackground of the Merger\nIn July 2019, Eureka Homestead Bancorp completed its initial public offering and became the stock\nholding company of Eureka Homestead in connection with Eureka Homestead’s mutual to stock conversion.\nSince that time, Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s board of directors and senior management have periodically\nreviewed and assessed Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s strategic alternatives and the business and regulatory\nenvironments facing Eureka Homestead Bancorp and Eureka Homestead. As part of this process, Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp’s board of directors and senior management have periodically reviewed and discussed\nstrategic alternatives, including a possible merger or sale transaction, and have consulted periodically with\nrepresentatives of investment banking firms, including Performance Trust, regarding strategic planning\nmatters. Performance Trust is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience\nadvising financial institutions with respect to mergers and acquisitions and other matters. Eureka Homestead\nBancorp’s board of directors determined that Performance Trust’s existing relationships as disclosed to Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp would not interfere with its ability to provide investment banking services to Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp, and in August 2022 the board of directors engaged Performance Trust to represent the\nCompany as its investment advisory firm in connection with a strategic review, including a possible merger or sale\nof the Company.\nEureka Homestead Bancorp’s board of directors met on September 12, 2022, with representatives of\nPerformance Trust and representatives of Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s legal counsel attending. The board of\ndirectors discussed Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s strategic alternatives, including continued independence and\npotentially engaging in a strategic transaction, such as a merger or sale, and the perceived advantages and\ndisadvantages of each alternative in light of the then prevailing market and economic conditions. The board of\ndirectors noted that the rising interest rate environment had significantly slowed mortgage banking activity,\none of Eureka Homestead’s core businesses, which was expected to reduce fee income and negatively impact\nearnings, and had increased funding costs, which had reduced, and was expected to continue to reduce,\nprofitability and narrow profit margins. The potential that market interest rates would continue to rise given\ncontinuing inflationary pressures was also noted. The board of directors also discussed (i) Eureka Homestead’s\nlimited retail deposit base and its reliance on wholesale funding; (ii) the age of Eureka Homestead’s customer base,\n(iii) Eureka Homestead’s limited product menu including no checking and electronic banking, (iv) the Company’s\nrecent losses from operations, (v) increased local competition, (vi) steadily increasing IT and other overhead\nexpenses, (vii) employee, officer and director succession, (viii) the limited size of Eureka Homestead’s single office,\n(ix) Eureka Homestead’s overall tiny size and (x) the financial and other resources that would need to be\nexpended to attract and train qualified successors to Eureka Homestead’s senior management upon future\nretirements. The board of directors also noted that evolving technology competition in the banking business\nwould require Eureka Homestead Bancorp to invest significantly in technology infrastructure, which would\n13\nplace additional pressure on profitability and profit margins. After lengthy discussion, it was the consensus of\nthe board of directors that Eureka Homestead Bancorp, given its size, prevailing economic conditions, and\nother factors, would likely face significant challenges to growth and profitability by operating independently\nunder its existing business plan.\nAt the September 12th meeting, representatives of Performance Trust provided information regarding\nthe then prevailing mergers and acquisitions market, including recent bank and thrift merger transaction\npricing metrics. The board of directors also reviewed and discussed a list of 56 banks and credit unions,\ndeveloped by Performance Trust in consultation with Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s senior management which\nmight have an interest in a potential business combination with Eureka Homestead Bancorp and the capacity to\nacquire Eureka Homestead Bancorp on terms which may be favorable to Eureka Homestead Bancorp\nstockholders. The board of directors also discussed with Performance Trust and legal counsel the process for\nsoliciting non-binding indications of interest from potential interested parties by distributing a confidential\ninformation memorandum (“CIM”).\nAfter further discussion, the board of directors authorized Performance Trust to work with Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp’s senior management and legal counsel to prepare a CIM for distribution to the potential\ninterested parties identified by Performance Trust in consultation with Eureka Homestead Bancorp,\nconditioned upon executing a confidentiality agreement with Eureka Homestead Bancorp.\nDuring September 2022, Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s senior management and Performance Trust\nprepared a CIM. Thereafter, Eureka Homestead Bancorp populated a virtual data room containing financial\nand other information regarding Eureka Homestead Bancorp. Representatives of Performance Trust contacted\n56 potential interested parties, including both banks and credit unions, primarily in Louisiana but also in other\nstates, each on the list of potential interested parties identified by Performance Trust in consultation with\nEureka Homestead Bancorp, as well as investor groups, without revealing the identity of Eureka Homestead\nBancorp. Following this outreach, 25 parties signed confidentiality agreements and the identity of Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp was disclosed to them. The 25 parties that signed confidentiality agreements were\nprovided a CIM and granted access to the virtual data room. As a result of this solicitation process, Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp received three non-binding indications of interest letters (each, an “IOI”), two of which\nwere from investor groups and one of which was from a bank, COMPANIES A-C.\nEureka Homestead Bancorp’s board of directors met on October 19, 2022, with representatives of\nPerformance Trust and legal counsel attending, to review the results of the solicitation process and the terms of\nthe IOIs received from COMPANIES A-C. COMPANY A was an investor group. Its proposal was for an\naggregate all-cash consideration of $24.6 million, or an estimated per share price of $23.97. COMPANY B was\nanother investor group. Its proposal was for an aggregate all-cash consideration of $26.1 million, or an estimated\n$25.44 per share. COMPANY C was a financial institution. Its proposal was all-stock and for a nominal aggregate\npurchase price of $18.45 million, or an estimated $17.98 per share. The IOI from COMPANY C was considerably\nless detailed than the IOIs from the other companies and did not address a number of requested items raised in the\nCIM.\nThe Board next discussed Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s current business plan and projections and\nthoroughly discussed all three IOIs, including the financial and managerial resources of the parties submitting them,\nthe proposed form of consideration and their ability to pay, the deal terms, execution risks and any contingencies. In\nthis regard, there was broad discussion about the execution risks to entering into a strategic transaction with an\ninvestor group as opposed to a financial institution. In the case of COMPANY C which proposed stock\nconsideration, the board also reviewed relevant data concerning the pricing, liquidity, dividends and merits of the\nstock both currently and on a pro forma basis. It was noted that the stock of COMPANY C was controlled by one\nlarge shareholder which could materially impact its liquidity and the ability of Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s\nshareholders to dispose of the stock upon consummation of a transaction. Additionally, it was noted that\nCOMPANY C had not been particularly responsive in addressing questions Performance Trust had proposed to it.\nFinally, there were some concerns regarding the operations of COMPANY C. After further discussion, the board\ndetermined that due to the materially lower pricing of the COMPANY C proposal, the illiquidity of the stock, as\nwell as the perception that COMPANY C did not have a strong interest in pursuing a transaction, the board\n14\ninstructed Performance Trust to tell COMPANY C that it was not going to be invited to the next round of diligence\nunless it materially enhanced its proposal.\nIn discussing the IOIs of COMPANY A and COMPANY B, the Board discussed at length the execution\nrisk in any transaction with a non-financial institution. In this regard, the Board voted to require that any investor\ngroup have a pre-filing meeting with Company representatives in attendance with bank regulators to gauge the\nlikelihood of approval. There was discussion with regard to the IOIs that the Board would need further clarity on\ncalculations and what, if any, transaction costs and contract termination costs might be deducted from the aggregate\npurchase price of each proposal. The Board also reviewed the two groups’ proposed business plans. In this regard,\nthe Board noted that the proposed business plan of COMPANY B included the provision of banking services\ninvolving cryptocurrency which could add substantial additional regulatory and execution risk.\nAfter further discussion, the Board believed it to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders\nto continue negotiations with COMPANY A and COMPANY B. In this regard, the Board instructed Performance\nTrust to further negotiate certain points and report back to management. Specifically, Performance Trust was\ninstructed to notify each party that the Company will expect a definitive agreement to include a reverse break-up fee\nto be paid to the Company in the event that the investor group is unable to obtain regulatory approval and\nconsummate the transaction by an agreed upon date. Further, to avoid costly litigation, it was hoped that some or all\nof this reverse break-up fee should be placed on deposit with the Bank at the time of a signing of a definitive\nagreement.\nPerformance Trust was instructed to communicate to COMPANY C that Eureka Homestead Bancorp\nwould not pursue a transaction with COMPANY C under the current terms and was further instructed to contact\nCOMPANY A and B to obtain clarification on the Board’s questions.\nIn late October, COMPANY A and COMPANY B each communicated to Performance Trust that they no\nlonger desired to pursue a transaction. COMPANY B explained that it believed it could not obtain regulatory\napproval based on its proposed business plan in view of the recent failures of several cryptocurrency exchanges and\nCOMPANY A explained it did not believe it could obtain expeditious funding or regulatory approvals.\nAlso in late October, the Investor Group contacted Performance Trust to discuss a possible transaction at\nwhich time management and Performance Trust began numerous conversations with its primary representative, and\non November 7, the Investor Group submitted an IOI. Also in early November, COMPANY C submitted a revised\nIOI.\nThe Board met on November 16, 2022 to discuss the progress of the possible transaction and discussed the\nIOI from the Investor Group and the revised IOI from COMPANY C. The COMPANY C revised proposal resulted\nin a reduced nominal value of approximate aggregate consideration of $18.2 million, or an estimated $17.73 per\nshare, to be payable in cash or COMPANY C stock but the revised IOI again did not provide most of the other\ninformation that had been requested, and there remained very substantial uncertainties regarding the proposal and\nthe value thereof. In the view of the Board, this raised substantial ongoing issues regarding the overall value of the\nproposal and COMPANY C’s true interest in a transaction at an attractive price to the Company. After further\ndiscussion the board instructed Performance Trust to communicate to COMPANY C that Eureka Homestead\nBancorp would not pursue a transaction with COMPANY C under the current terms.\nThe Investor Group proposal was an all-cash proposal of $20.0 million plus an additional $2.0 million for\ntransaction expenses. The IOI contemplated that the Company would be entitled, subject to regulatory approval, to\nmake a special dividend of $9.0 million prior to closing and the Investor Group would pay an additional $13.0\nmillion in cash. Performance Trust and management had modeled the impact of this proposal and, assuming\npayment of the special dividend, it represented between $20.00 and $22.00 per share. The IOI provided for a 90-day\nexclusivity period from the date of the signing of the LOI whereby the Company could not solicit, initiate or\nparticipate in any discussion regarding a strategic transaction with any other parties. Performance Trust noted that an\nexclusivity provision was customary and the Investor Group would likely not continue to negotiate a final IOI\nwithout it. Further, Performance Trust noted its expectation that the Investor Group would pursue another\ntransaction if the Company did not continue to engage in specific negotiations with it towards the execution of an\nIOI.\n15\nThe Board again noted the execution risk in any transaction with a non-financial institution. Specifically,\nthe Board discussed the risks regarding funding and regulatory non-objection. In this regard, the Board instructed\nmanagement to negotiate with the assistance of Performance Trust IOI provisions that (1) prior to signing a\ndefinitive agreement, the Investor Group and Company representatives would participate in informal meetings with\nregulatory officials to discuss the regulatory process and assess the likelihood of regulatory approval; and (2) require\nthe Investor Group to pay a fee (a “reverse termination fee”) to the Company under certain enumerated scenarios,\nincluding if the deal has not closed by a certain date. After further discussion, the board instructed Performance\nTrust to assist management to negotiate a definitive IOI with the Investor Group, and on December 1, 2022, the\nCompany signed an IOI with the Investor Group.\nDuring December 2022 through February 2023, the Investor Group conducted additional diligence on\nEureka Homestead Bancorp and management conducted reverse diligence on the Investor Group and further\ndiscussed the resulting business plan in an evolving business climate.\nOn March 7,2023 the board met to discuss an extension of the exclusivity period with the Investor Group.\nIn consultation with Performance Trust, the board determined that the ongoing uncertainty in the economic climate,\nincluding the uncertainty of additional interest rates increases, a potential recession and a potential banking crisis,\ncontinued to provide substantial challenges to potential buyers and the overall mergers and acquisitions market.\nMoreover, Performance Trust reported that no additional parties had contacted it with regard to a possible\ntransaction other than the Investor Group which appeared to show a continuing commitment to the transaction. The\nboard noted the substantial resources the Investor Group had committed in connection with the possible transaction.\nThe board then discussed the ongoing stand-alone prospects of Eureka Homestead Bancorp, and the board\nunanimously agreed that it believed moving forward with a strategic transaction was in the best interest of the\nCompany and its shareholders, and determined it was in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to\nextend the exclusivity period.\nOn April 13 the board again met to discuss the extension of the exclusivity period with the Investor Group\nand, following the same analysis as the March 7th meeting, determined to extend the exclusivity period.\nOn April 17, the Investor Group had a pre-filing meeting with the OCC where it presented its proposal to\nacquire control of the Company and Eureka Homestead. Management of Eureka Homestead and its legal counsel\nattended this meeting. On April 27, the Investor Group had a pre-filing meeting with the Federal Reserve.\nOn April 20, 2023, the Investor Group’s counsel distributed an initial draft of the merger agreement to\nEureka Homestead Bancorp’s legal counsel. Between April 20 and August 3, multiple drafts of the merger\nagreement were exchanged and representatives of the Investor Group’s legal counsel and representatives of\nEureka Homestead Bancorp’s legal counsel participated in calls to discuss open issues, which included deal\nprotections, termination fees, the conduct of Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s business before closing, certain\nrepresentations and warranties, and employee matters. During this time period, the Investor Group conducted\nfurther due diligence on Eureka Homestead Bancorp and Eureka Homestead Bancorp conducted reverse due\ndiligence on the Investor Group. The final definitive agreement included a reverse break-up fee to be paid\nunder certain circumstances by the Investor Group to the Company and provided for the reverse break-up fee\nto be placed in an escrow account at Eureka Homestead, subject to certain conditions.\nEureka Homestead Bancorp’s board of directors met on August 3, 2023, with representatives of\nPerformance Trust and legal counsel attending, to consider the approval of the merger agreement and the\ntransactions contemplated by it. Before the meeting, senior management distributed to each director the\nproposed merger agreement, and ancillary documents, and a financial presentation prepared by Performance\nTrust. Performance Trust reviewed in detail the pricing and other financial terms of the proposed merger\nagreement. Among other things the board reviewed in depth was a detailed final model showing the potential\nper share price range. The board also reviewed in detail the non-pricing terms and conditions of the proposed\nmerger agreement, including, but not limited to, the transaction structure, the respective representations,\nwarranties and covenants made by Eureka Homestead Bancorp and the Investor Group, the closing conditions,\nand the respective termination rights of Eureka Homestead Bancorp and the Investor Group. The board of\ndirectors reviewed all aspects of the merger process, including Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s current financial\n16\nposition, performance and prospects; its decision to pursue a strategic transaction; the process used to identify\npotential merger partners and solicit merger proposals; then current economic and stock market conditions,\nincluding the impact of rising interest rates; Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s due diligence investigation of the\nInvestor Group, including its financial condition and ability to consummate the transaction from a financial\nand regulatory standpoint; the terms and conditions of the proposed merger agreement; the value of the\nproposed merger consideration; and the impact of the proposed merger on Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s\nstockholders and other constituencies. All issues posed by the directors were addressed by senior\nmanagement, representatives of Performance Trust or representatives of legal counsel, as appropriate.\nRepresentatives of Performance Trust then presented Performance Trust’s written opinion letter addressed to\nthe board of directors to the effect that, as of August 3, 2023, and subject to the procedures followed,\nassumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by\nPerformance Trust as set forth in the opinion letter, the merger consideration to be paid by the Investor Group\nto Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s common stockholders pursuant to the proposed merger agreement was fair to\nEureka Homestead Bancorp’s common stockholders from a financial point of view. After considering the\nproposed merger agreement, and ancillary documents, and the matters discussed at the meeting and at prior\nmeetings of the board of directors, the board of directors voted unanimously to adopt and approve the proposed\nmerger agreement, to recommend that Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s stockholders vote to approve the proposed\nmerger agreement, and to authorize management to execute and deliver the merger agreement, and ancillary\ndocuments, on behalf of Eureka Homestead Bancorp.\nOn August 3, 2023, Eureka Homestead Bancorp and the Investor Group executed the merger\nagreement. On August 4, 2023, after the close of trading on the stock markets, Eureka Homestead Bancorp\nand the Investor Group issued a joint press release to publicize the execution of the merger agreement.\nEureka Homestead Bancorp’s Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Board of Directors that\nEureka Homestead Bancorp Stockholders Vote “FOR” Approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger\nThe Eureka Homestead Bancorp Board of Directors reviewed and discussed the proposed merger with\nmanagement and Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s financial and legal advisors in unanimously determining that the\nproposed merger is in the best interests of Eureka Homestead Bancorp and its stockholders. In reaching its\ndetermination to approve the Merger Agreement and the merger, the Board of Directors considered several factors\naffecting the business, operations, financial condition, earnings and future prospects of Eureka Homestead Bancorp.\nThe material factors considered by the Board of Directors included:\n(cid:120) The business strategy and strategic plan of Eureka Homestead Bancorp, its prospects for the\nfuture, and its projected financial results.\n(cid:120) The understanding of the Board of Directors of the strategic options available to Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp and its assessment of those options with respect to the prospects and\nestimated results of the execution by Eureka Homestead Bancorp of its business plan as an\nindependent entity under various scenarios and the determination that none of those options or the\nexecution of the business plan was more likely to create greater present value for Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp’s stockholders than the value to be paid by the Investor Group.\n(cid:120) The challenges facing Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s management to grow Eureka Homestead\nBancorp’s franchise and enhance stockholder value given current market conditions, including\nincreased operating costs resulting from regulatory and compliance mandates, continued pressure\non net interest margins from the current interest rate environment and competition.\n(cid:120) The merger consideration offered by the Investor Group equaled or exceeded the consideration\nthat could reasonably be expected from other potential acquirers with apparent ability to\nconsummate a merger with Eureka Homestead Bancorp.\n(cid:120) The consideration offered by the Investor Group, which, based on the estimated range, represents:\nan approximate 62.2% market premium over the then quoted price of the common stock, 107.5%\n17\nof Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s tangible book value at June 30, 2023; and a 2.4% core deposit\npremium.\n(cid:120) Its knowledge of the current regulatory and competitive environment in the financial services\nindustry, including increasing operating costs resulting from regulatory, technology and\ncompliance mandates, increasing competition from both banks and non-bank financial and\nfinancial technology firms and the likely effects of these factors on Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s\npotential growth, development, productivity and strategic options\n(cid:120) The financial presentation of Performance Trust to the Board of Directors and the opinion, dated\nAugust 3, 2023, of Performance Trust to the Eureka Homestead Bancorp Board of Directors as to\nthe fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the merger\nconsideration to the holders of Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock, as more fully described\nbelow under “ (cid:237) Opinion of Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s Financial Advisor.”\n(cid:120) The form and amount of the merger consideration, including the reduced volatility provided by\ncash consideration.\n(cid:120) The ability of the Investor Group to execute a merger transaction from a financial and regulatory\nperspective.\n(cid:120) The expectation that the required regulatory approvals could be obtained in a timely fashion.\n(cid:120) The prospects for Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s employees within the combined company.\n(cid:120) The Investor Group’s plans to infuse additional capital into Eureka Homestead following\ncompletion of the merger to support future growth.\n(cid:120) The likelihood of obtaining the stockholder and regulatory approvals needed to complete the\ntransaction.\n(cid:120) The Eureka Homestead Bancorp board’s review with its independent legal advisor, Luse Gorman,\nPC, of the material terms of the Merger Agreement, including the board’s ability, under certain\ncircumstances, to consider an unsolicited Company takeover proposal, subject to the required\npayment by Eureka Homestead Bancorp of a termination fee to the Investor Group, which the\nBoard of Directors concluded was reasonable in the context of termination fees in comparable\ntransactions and in light of the overall terms of the Merger Agreement.\n(cid:120) The results of the solicitation process conducted by Eureka Homestead Bancorp, with the advice\nand assistance of its advisors.\n(cid:120) Certain structural protections included in the Merger Agreement, including:\n(cid:190) that the Merger Agreement does not preclude a third party from making an unsolicited\nCompany takeover proposal to Eureka Homestead Bancorp and that, under certain\ncircumstances more fully described under “ (cid:237) Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers,”\nEureka Homestead Bancorp may furnish non-public information to and enter into\ndiscussions with such a third party regarding a Company takeover proposal;\n(cid:190) the ability of the Board of Directors to withdraw, modify or amend its recommendation to\nstockholders regarding approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger in the event\nthat Eureka Homestead Bancorp receives a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger\nAgreement);\n18\n(cid:190) the ability of Eureka Homestead Bancorp to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter\ninto a definitive agreement with a third party provided that certain requirements are met,\nincluding the payment of a termination fee by Eureka Homestead Bancorp of $520,000,\nan amount that was negotiated at arm’s-length and was determined by the Board of\nDirectors to be reasonable; and\n(cid:190) The Investor Group’s agreement to pay to Eureka Homestead Bancorp a reverse break-up\nfee of $275,000 under certain limited circumstances in which (a) the Investor Group was\nunable to obtain regulatory approval, (b) the merger is not consummated on or prior to\nAugust 3, 2024, provided the Company’s actions or failure to act has not been the cause\nof or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date and such action\nor failure to act constitutes a material breach of the Merger Agreement or (c) the Investor\nGroup has not satisfactorily completed the Capital Raise, and to place the reverse break-\nup fee in escrow with Eureka Homestead at the time of execution of the Merger\nAgreement.\nThe Board of Directors also considered a number of potential risks and uncertainties in connection with its\nconsideration of the proposed merger, including, without limitation, the following:\n(cid:120) The potential risk of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp’s business and towards the completion of the merger.\n(cid:120) The restrictions on the conduct of Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s business before the completion of\nthe merger, which are customary for merger agreements involving financial institutions, but\nwhich, subject to specific exceptions, could delay or prevent Eureka Homestead Bancorp from\nundertaking business opportunities that may arise or any other action it would otherwise take with\nrespect to the operations of Eureka Homestead Bancorp absent the pending merger.\n(cid:120) That the interests of certain of Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s directors and executive officers may\nbe different from, or in addition to, the interests of Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s other\nstockholders as described under the heading “ (cid:237) Financial Interests of Directors and Executive\nOfficers in the Merger.”\n(cid:120) The risk that the conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the Merger Agreement may not\nbe satisfied, including the risk that necessary regulatory approvals or the Eureka Homestead\nBancorp stockholder approval might not be obtained and, as a result, the merger may not be\nconsummated.\n(cid:120) The risk that the aggregate and estimated per share consideration is subject to significant\nadjustment based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, Eureka Homestead\nBancorp’s transaction costs in excess of an aggregate amount of $2,000,000 and any amount\nrequired to be added to the allowance for credit losses and the inability of Eureka Homestead\nBancorp to obtain regulatory approval for a special dividend to its stockholders immediately prior\nto consummation of the merger.\n(cid:120) The risk of potential employee attrition and/or adverse effects on business and customer\nrelationships as a result of the pending merger.\n(cid:120) That: (1) Eureka Homestead Bancorp would be prohibited from affirmatively soliciting Company\ntakeover proposals after execution of the Merger Agreement; and (2) Eureka Homestead Bancorp\nwould be obligated to pay to the Investor Group a termination fee if the Merger Agreement is\nterminated under certain circumstances, which may discourage other parties potentially interested\nin a strategic transaction with Eureka Homestead Bancorp from pursuing such a transaction.\n19\n(cid:120) The potential costs associated with executing the Merger Agreement, including estimated advisor\nfees.\n(cid:120) The possibility of litigation in connection with the merger.\n(cid:120) The possibility that the required regulatory approval or non-objection for the proposed dividend\nwill not be received.\n(cid:120) The fact that Eureka Homestead Bancorp stockholders would not be entitled to appraisal or\ndissenters’ rights in connection with the merger.\n(cid:120) The risk that the Investor Group might not perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement\nnecessary to consummate the transaction.\nThe Board of Directors evaluated the factors described above and reached a unanimous determination that\nthe merger was in the best interests of Eureka Homestead Bancorp and its stockholders. In reaching its\ndetermination to approve and recommend the transaction, the Board of Directors looked at the totality of the\ninformation presented to it and did not assign any relative or specific weights to any of the individual factors\nconsidered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Board of Directors\nconsidered these factors as a whole, including the potential risks, uncertainties and disadvantages associated with the\nmerger, and considered the benefits of the merger overall to be favorable and outweigh the potential risks,\nuncertainties and disadvantages of the merger. This explanation of the Board of Directors’ reasoning and certain\nother information presented in this section are forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the\nfactors discussed under “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information.” The foregoing\ndiscussion of the information and factors considered by the Board of Directors is not intended to be\nexhaustive, but constitutes the material factors considered by the Board of Directors. The terms of the\nMerger Agreement were the product of arm’s-length negotiations between representatives of Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp and the Investor Group.\nThe Board of Directors unanimously recommends that Eureka Homestead Bancorp stockholders\nvote “FOR” approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger.\nOpinion of Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s Financial Advisor\nOn August 3, 2023, Performance Trust rendered to Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s board its written opinion\nwith respect to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Eureka Homestead Bancorp common\nstock, of the merger consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nPerformance Trust’s opinion was directed to Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s board and only addressed the\nfairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock of the merger\nconsideration and did not address any other aspect or implication of the merger. The references to Performance\nTrust’s opinion in this proxy statement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of Performance\nTrust’s written opinion, which is included as Appendix B to this proxy statement and sets forth the procedures\nfollowed, assumptions made, qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken and other matters considered\nby Performance Trust in preparing its opinion. However, neither Performance Trust’s opinion, nor the summary of\nits opinion and the related analyses set forth in this proxy statement are intended to be, and they do not constitute,\nadvice or a recommendation to Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s board or any shareholder of Eureka Homestead\nBancorp as to how to act or vote with respect to any matter relating to the Merger Agreement or otherwise.\nPerformance Trust’s opinion was furnished for the use and benefit of Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s board (in its\ncapacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the merger and should not be construed as creating, and\nPerformance Trust will not be deemed to have, any fiduciary duty to Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s board, Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp, any security holder or creditor of Eureka Homestead Bancorp or any other person, regardless\nof any prior or ongoing advice or relationships.\nIn issuing its opinion, among other things, Performance Trust:\n20\n(i) reviewed a draft, dated August 3, 2023, of the Merger Agreement;\n(ii) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to Eureka Homestead\nBancorp and the Investor Group;\n(iii) reviewed certain other business, financial, and operating information relating to Eureka Homestead\nBancorp provided to Performance Trust by the management of Eureka Homestead Bancorp;\n(iv) met with, either by phone or in person, certain members of Eureka Homestead Bancorp and the\nInvestor Group to discuss the business prospects of Eureka Homestead Bancorp and the Investor\nGroup and the proposed transaction;\n(v) reviewed certain financial terms of the proposed transaction, and compared certain of those terms with\nthe publicly available financial terms of certain transactions that have recently been affected or\nannounced;\n(vi) reviewed certain financial data of Eureka Homestead Bancorp and compared that data with similar data\nfor companies with publicly traded equity securities that Performance Trust deemed relevant; and\n(vii) considered such other information, financial studies, analyses, investigations, economic data, and\nmarket criteria that Performance Trust deemed relevant.\nIn connection with its review, Performance Trust has not independently verified any of the foregoing\ninformation and Performance Trust has assumed and relied upon such information being complete and accurate in\nall material respects. With respect to the financial forecasts for Eureka Homestead Bancorp that Performance Trust\nused in its analyses, the management of Eureka Homestead Bancorp has advised Performance Trust, and it has\nassumed, that such forecasts have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates\nand judgments of the management of Eureka Homestead Bancorp as to the future financial performance of Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp, and Performance Trust expresses no opinion with respect to such estimates or the assumptions\non which they are based. Performance Trust has relied upon and assumed, without independent verification, that\nthere has been no change in the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or\nprospects of Eureka Homestead Bancorp since the respective dates of the most recent financial statements and other\ninformation, financial or otherwise, provided to Performance Trust that would be material to its analyses or this\nopinion, and that there is no information or any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by\nPerformance Trust incomplete or misleading. Performance Trust has also assumed, with Eureka Homestead\nBancorp’s consent, that, in the course of obtaining any regulatory or third party consents, approvals or agreements in\nconnection with the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse\neffect on Eureka Homestead Bancorp, the Investor Group or the contemplated benefits of the merger and that the\nmerger will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement without waiver, modification or\namendment of any term, condition or provision thereof that would be material to Performance Trust’s analyses or\nthis opinion. Performance Trust has assumed, with Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s consent, that the Merger\nAgreement, when executed by the parties thereto, conformed to the draft reviewed by Performance Trust in all\nrespects material to its analyses.\nPerformance Trust’s opinion only addresses the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger\nconsideration to the holders of Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock in the manner set forth in the full text of\nits opinion, which is included as Appendix B, and the opinion does not address any other aspect or implication of the\nmerger or any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with the merger or otherwise,\nincluding, without limitation, the amount or nature of, or any other aspect relating to, any compensation to any\nofficers, directors or employees of any party to the merger, or class of such persons, relative to the merger\nconsideration or otherwise.\nThe issuance of Performance Trust’s opinion was approved by an authorized internal committee of\nPerformance Trust.\nPerformance Trust’s opinion was necessarily based upon information made available to it as of the date the\nopinion was delivered of August 3, 2023, and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed and\n21\ncould be evaluated on the date the opinion was delivered. Performance Trust has no obligation to update, revise,\nreaffirm or withdraw its opinion, or otherwise comment on or consider events occurring after the date the opinion\nwas delivered. Performance Trust’s opinion does not address the relative merits of the merger as compared to\nalternative transactions or strategies that might be available to Eureka Homestead Bancorp, nor does it address the\nunderlying business decision of Eureka Homestead Bancorp or the board to approve, recommend or proceed with\nthe merger. Furthermore, no opinion, counsel or interpretation is intended in matters that require legal, regulatory,\naccounting, insurance, tax or other similar professional advice. It is assumed that such opinions, counsel or\ninterpretations have been or will be obtained from the appropriate professional sources. Furthermore, Performance\nTrust has relied on, with Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s consent, advice of the outside counsel and the independent\naccountants of Eureka Homestead Bancorp, and on the assumptions of the management of Eureka Homestead\nBancorp, as to all legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance and tax matters with respect to Eureka Homestead\nBancorp, the Investor Group, and the merger.\nIn preparing its opinion to Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s board, Performance Trust performed a variety of\nanalyses, including those described below. The summary of Performance Trust’s analyses is not a complete\ndescription of the analyses underlying Performance Trust’s opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a\ncomplex process involving various quantitative and qualitative judgments and determinations with respect to the\nfinancial, comparative and other analytic methods employed and the adaptation and application of those methods to\nthe unique facts and circumstances presented. As a consequence, neither Performance Trust’s opinion nor the\nanalyses underlying its opinion are readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Performance\nTrust arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not\ndraw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any individual analysis, analytic method or factor.\nAccordingly, Performance Trust believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions\nof its analyses, analytic methods and factors, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description\nof the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion.\nIn performing its analyses, Performance Trust considered business, economic, industry and market\nconditions, financial and otherwise, and other matters as they existed on, and could be evaluated as of, the date of its\nopinion. While the results of each analysis were taken into account in reaching its overall conclusion with respect to\nfairness, Performance Trust did not make separate or quantifiable judgments regarding individual analyses. The\nimplied value reference ranges indicated by Performance Trust’s analyses are illustrative and not necessarily\nindicative of actual values nor predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less\nfavorable than those suggested by the analyses. In addition, any analyses relating to the value of assets, businesses or\nsecurities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be\nsold, which may depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s control,\nthe Investor Group’s control, and Performance Trust’s control. Much of the information used in, and accordingly\nthe results of, Performance Trust’s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.\nPerformance Trust’s opinion and analyses were provided to Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s board in\nconnection with its consideration of the proposed merger and were among many factors considered by Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp’s board in evaluating the proposed merger. Neither Performance Trust’s opinion nor its\nanalyses were determinative of the merger consideration or of the views of Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s board with\nrespect to the proposed merger.\nThe following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed in connection with Performance\nTrust’s opinion rendered to Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s board on August 3, 2023. No company or transaction\nused in the analyses described below is identical or directly comparable to Eureka Homestead Bancorp or the\nproposed transaction. The analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables\nalone do not constitute a complete description of the analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without\nconsidering the full narrative description of the analyses, as well as the methodologies underlying, and the\nassumptions, qualifications and limitations affecting, each analysis, could create a misleading or incomplete view of\nPerformance Trust’s analyses.\nSummary of Aggregate Merger Consideration and Implied Transaction Metrics\nPerformance Trust reviewed the financial terms of the proposed merger. The Merger Agreement provides\nfor cash merger consideration equal to $13.0 million. In addition, immediately prior to closing the Company will be\n22\npermitted, subject to regulatory approval, to pay a dividend equal to an amount by which the Company’s adjusted\ntangible shareholders’ equity, as defined in the Merger Agreement, exceeds $10.0 million. Company shareholders\nare currently estimated to receive between $20.00 and $22.00 in cash consideration for each share of Company\ncommon stock (the “per share consideration”). The per share consideration ultimately received by shareholders is\nsubject to significant adjustment based on a variety of factors including but not limited to the Company’s future\noperating results, transaction costs, the costs to terminate certain of the Company’s contracts and the Company’s\naccumulated other comprehensive income or loss. As a result, Company shareholders should not assume they will\nreceive between $20.00 and $22.00 per share upon the closing of the transaction.\nFor purposes of the fairness opinion, Performance Trust used a reasonable midpoint of the above range\nwith an implied merger consideration per share of Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock of $21.08, with an\naggregate transaction value of approximately $20.7 million. Based upon historical financial information for Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp as of or for the last twelve months (“LTM”) ended June 30, 2023, Performance Trust calculated\nthe implied transaction metrics listed in the table below.\nTransaction Value / Tangible Common Equity 107.5%\nPremium to Core Deposits 2.4%\nPremium to Market Price 62.2%\nEureka Homestead Bancorp Selected National Public Companies Analysis\nPerformance Trust considered certain financial information for Eureka Homestead Bancorp and compared\nit with selected companies whose equity is publicly traded that Performance Trust deemed relevant.

Performance Trust has an investment banking division and is regularly engaged in the\nvaluation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions. Performance Trust will receive\ncustomary investment banking fees for its services, a significant portion of which is contingent upon the\nconsummation of the transaction. Eureka Homestead Bancorp has previously paid Performance Trust a $15,000\nretainer fee, $75,000 progress fee upon execution of the Merger Agreement and the delivery of its fairness opinion.\nUpon closing of the transaction, Eureka Homestead Bancorp will pay Performance Trust a success fee of $225,000,\nless the retainer fee. In addition, Eureka Homestead Bancorp has agreed to indemnify Performance Trust and certain\nrelated parties for certain liabilities arising out of or related to the engagement and to reimburse Performance Trust\nfor certain expenses incurred in connection with its engagement.\nPerformance Trust is a broker-dealer engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities as well as\nproviding investment banking and other financial services. In the ordinary course of business, Performance Trust\nand its affiliates may acquire, hold or sell, for its and its affiliates own accounts and the accounts of customers,\nequity, debt and other securities and financial instruments (including bank loans and other obligations) of Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp, the Investor Group and certain of their affiliates as well as provide investment banking and\nother financial services to such companies and entities. Certain Performance Trust employees are shareholders of\nEureka Homestead Bancorp, which was disclosed to the Eureka Homestead Bancorp board and is included in the\ndisclosures of Performance Trust’s written fairness opinion attached to the proxy statement as Appendix B.\nSurrender of Shares; Payment of Merger Consideration\nNo later than the business day before the effective time of the merger, the Investor Group will deposit a\nsufficient amount of cash with the Exchange Agent, as defined in the Merger Agreement, to pay the aggregate\nmerger consideration. The Exchange Agent will facilitate the payment of the merger consideration to the holders of\nrecord of shares of Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock.\nAs soon as practicable, but not later than five business days, after the closing date of the merger, the\nExchange Agent will mail to each holder of record of Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock a letter of\ntransmittal with instructions on how to surrender certificates representing shares of Eureka Homestead Bancorp\ncommon stock for the merger consideration. Stockholders of record whose shares are held electronically will be\nautomatically converted into the per share merger consideration.\nPlease do not send in your Eureka Homestead Bancorp stock certificates until you receive the letter\nof transmittal and instructions from the Paying Agent. Do not return your stock certificates with the enclosed\nproxy card.\nAfter you mail the letter of transmittal and surrender your Eureka Homestead Bancorp stock certificates in\naccordance with the instructions you will receive, you will receive the merger consideration that you are entitled to\n27\nreceive, after giving effect to any required tax withholdings. At the effective time of the merger, your shares of\nEureka Homestead Bancorp common stock will be canceled. You will not be entitled to receive interest on any\nportion of the merger consideration.\nAny portion of the merger consideration that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Eureka Homestead\nBancorp for more than one year after the effective time of the merger will be repaid to the Investor Group. If you\nhave not complied with the exchange procedures described above within the time period previously described, you\nmay only look to the Investor Group for payment of the merger consideration you are entitled to receive in exchange\nfor your shares of common stock, without any interest, and subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and\nsimilar laws.\nIf your Eureka Homestead Bancorp stock certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, you will be\nrequired to sign an affidavit before you receive any consideration for your shares. The Exchange Agent will send\nyou instructions on how to complete such an affidavit. You may be required to post a bond in a reasonable amount\nas the Investor Group or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim related to your common\nstock.\nThe Investor Group or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the merger\nconsideration otherwise payable to any Eureka Homestead Bancorp stockholder the amounts the Investor Group or\nthe Exchange Agent, as the case may be, are required to deduct and withhold under any applicable federal, state,\nlocal or foreign tax law. If the Investor Group or the Exchange Agent withholds any amounts, these amounts will be\ntreated as having been paid to the stockholders from whom they were withheld.\nCertain Federal Income Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders\nThe following is a discussion of certain federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as\ndefined below) of Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive\nthe per share merger consideration at closing, estimated to be between $20.00 and $22.00 in cash, subject to\nadjustment pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), applicable current and proposed U.S. Treasury\nRegulations, judicial authority, and administrative rulings and practice, all of which are subject to change, possibly\non a retroactive basis. Any such change could alter the tax consequences described herein.\nFor purposes of this discussion, we use the term “U.S. holder” to mean a beneficial owner of shares of\nEureka Homestead Bancorp common stock that is:\n(cid:120) an individual citizen or resident of the United States;\n(cid:120) a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organized under the laws of the\nUnited States or any state thereof (or the District of Columbia);\n(cid:120) a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or\nmore U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) has a\nvalid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a\nU.S. person; or\n(cid:120) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.\nThis discussion assumes that the Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock is held for investment\npurposes. This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S federal income tax that may be relevant to a Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp stockholder in light of its particular circumstances, or that may apply to a Eureka Homestead\nBancorp stockholder that is subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (including but not\nlimited to foreign persons (generally, a person that is not a citizen or resident of the United States, a U.S. domestic\ncorporation, or a person that would otherwise be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis with\nrespect to their Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock), financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, dealers\n28\nin securities or foreign currencies, entities that are treated for federal income tax purposes as partnerships or other\npass-through entities, insurance companies or employees who acquired the stock pursuant to the exercise of\nemployee stock options or other compensation arrangements). This discussion is for general information only and\nis not tax advice. The U.S. federal income tax consequences described below are not intended to constitute a\ncomplete description of all tax consequences relating to the merger. Eureka Homestead Bancorp stockholders\nshould consult their own tax advisors to determine the tax consequences to them of, including the application\nand effect of any U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income, estate, gift and other tax laws to, the receipt of\nthe cash consideration in exchange for Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock pursuant to the merger.\nThe receipt of the merger consideration by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Eureka Homestead\nBancorp common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes\n(and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and foreign income or other tax laws). For U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder of Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock generally will recognize\ncapital gain or loss at the effective time of the merger equal to the difference, if any, between:\n(cid:120) per share merger consideration in cash received by the U.S. holder in exchange for such Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp common stock; and\n(cid:120) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock.\nSuch gain or loss generally will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period for\nthe Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock surrendered in the merger exceeds one year as of the date of the\nmerger. In general, long-term capital gain of individuals currently is subject to U.S. federal income tax at a\nmaximum rate of 20%. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.\nThe amount and character of gain or loss must be determined separately for each block of Eureka Homestead\nBancorp common stock (i.e., shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) exchanged for the merger\nconsideration in the merger.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code, the merger consideration received in the merger by a U.S. holder may be\nsubject to U.S. information reporting and backup withholding. Backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) will\napply with respect to the amount of cash received by a non-corporate U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder provides\nproof of an applicable exemption or a correct taxpayer identification number on an IRS Form W-9 (enclosed with\nthe letter of transmittal sent by the Paying Agent), and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the\nbackup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup\nwithholding rules may be refunded or credited against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any,\nprovided that such U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner.\nThe foregoing discussion does not claim to be a complete discussion of the potential tax consequences\nof the merger. Eureka Homestead Bancorp stockholders should consult their tax advisors as to the specific\ntax consequences to them of the merger, including the applicability and effect of U.S. Federal, state, local and\nforeign income, estate, gift and other tax laws in their particular circumstances. Nothing in this discussion is\nintended to be, or should be construed as, tax advice.\nCertain Effects of the Merger\nIf the Merger Agreement and the merger are approved by Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s stockholders and\ncertain other conditions to the closing of the merger are either satisfied or waived, Acquisition Corp., which is being\nformed as a subsidiary of the Investor Group to facilitate the merger, will merge with and into Eureka Homestead\nBancorp, with Eureka Homestead Bancorp as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp will become a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Investor Group and Eureka Homestead\nwill become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Investor Group.\nWhen the merger is completed, each outstanding share of common stock of Eureka Homestead Bancorp\n(other than shares of Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock owned by the Investor Group) will be converted\ninto the right to receive the per share merger consideration, estimated to be between $20.00 and $22.00 in cash at\nclosing, subject to adjustment under the terms of the Merger Agreement. At the effective time of the merger, Eureka\n29\nHomestead Bancorp’s stockholders will cease to have ownership interests in Eureka Homestead Bancorp or rights as\nstockholders of Eureka Homestead Bancorp, except for the right to receive merger consideration.\nEureka Homestead Bancorp’s shares of common stock are quoted on the OTC Pink Marketplace (OTCPK)\nunder the symbol “ERKH.” It is expected that following the merger, the Eureka Homestead Bancorp common\nshares will no longer be quoted on the OTCPK.\nEffects on Eureka Homestead Bancorp and Our Stockholders if the Merger is Not Completed\nIf the Merger Agreement is not approved by Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s stockholders or if the merger is\nnot completed for any other reason, Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s stockholders will not receive any payment for\ntheir shares in connection with the merger. Under certain circumstances described in the Merger Agreement, in\nconnection with a termination of the Merger Agreement, Eureka Homestead Bancorp is required to pay the Investor\nGroup a $520,000 termination fee. Additionally, under certain limited circumstances described in the Merger\nAgreement, in connection with a termination of the Merger Agreement, the Investor Group is required to pay Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp a $275,000 termination fee. For a description of the circumstances obligating payment of the\ntermination fees, see “ (cid:237) Termination Fees.”\nNo Appraisal Rights\nUnder Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s articles of incorporation, Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s stockholders\nare not entitled to exercise any rights of an objecting stockholder provided under the Maryland General Corporation\nLaw, unless the Board of Directors determines that such rights apply with respect to a transaction. The Board of\nDirectors has not made such a determination with respect to the merger. Accordingly, the stockholders of Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp do not have appraisal rights with respect to the merger.\nFinancial Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger\nAs described below, certain of Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s executive officers and directors have interests\nin the merger that are in addition to, or different from, the interests of Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s stockholders\ngenerally. The Board of Directors was aware of these interests and took them into account in approving the merger.\nThese interests include the following:\nPayments Under Employment Agreements with Eureka Homestead and Split-Dollar Life Insurance\nAgreements. Eureka Homestead previously entered into employment agreements with Alan T. Heintzen, Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and Cecil A. Haskins, Jr., President and Chief Financial Officer.\nUnder the employment agreements, in the event of a change in control of Eureka Homestead or Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp, followed by the executive’s involuntary termination other than for cause or upon the\nexecutive’s resignation following (a) the failure to appoint the executive to the executive positions set forth in the\nemployment agreement or a material change in function, duties or responsibilities resulting in a reduction of the\nresponsibility, scope, or importance of the executive’s position, (b) a relocation by more than 35 miles, (c) a material\nreduction in the benefits or perquisites paid to the executive unless the reduction is part of a reduction that is\ngenerally applicable to employees of Eureka Homestead, (d) a liquidation or dissolution of Eureka Homestead or (e)\na material breach of the employment agreement by Eureka Homestead, then the executive would be entitled to a\nlump sum cash severance payment equal to three times the executive’s “base amount,” as that term is defined for\npurposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 280G (i.e., the average annual taxable income paid to him for the five\ntaxable years preceding the taxable year in which the change in control occurs). In addition, the executive would be\nentitled, at no expense to the executive, to the continuation of non-taxable medical and dental coverage for thirty-six\n(36) months following his termination of employment, or if the coverage is not permitted by applicable law or if\nproviding the benefits would subject us to penalties, the executive would receive a cash lump sum payment equal to\nthe value of the health and dental benefits.\nIn connection with the merger, Eureka Homestead will take appropriate steps to terminate and pay out each\nof the employment agreements. Depending on the effective time of the merger, the estimated payments to be made\n30\nto Messrs. Heintzen and Haskins, respectively, in exchange for terminating the employment agreements, are\napproximately $729,211 and $872,432.\nSplit Dollar Life Insurance Agreements. The Investor Group will assume and honor each split-dollar life\ninsurance agreement previously entered into by Messrs. Heintzen and Haskins. The split-dollar life insurance\nagreements provide the individuals with certain life insurance coverage for the remainder of their life.\nDirector Retirement Plans. Eureka Homestead has entered into Director Retirement Plans with each of its\nnon-employee directors. Under the agreements, a director who remains in service on the board of directors until the\nnormal retirement age specified in the agreement (age 75) will be entitled to receive an annual retirement benefit of\n$12,000, paid in monthly installments for a period of ten years. Directors who separate from service prior to age 75,\nexcept Mr. Sagona, will also receive an annual benefit of $12,000, paid monthly over a period of ten years. The\nearly termination benefit payments will not begin, however, until the month following the month in which the\ndirector attains age 75. If Mr. Sagona voluntarily separates from service prior to May 1, 2025, he will receive a\nreduced annual benefit under the plan. If Mr. Sagona’s separation from service prior to May 1, 2025, is involuntary,\nhe will receive his accrued benefit, paid in equal monthly installments for ten years, beginning the month following\nthe month he attains age 75. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Mr. Sagona separates from service prior to May 1,\n2025, but following a change in control, his annual benefit will equal $12,000. Pursuant to the Plans, each director is\nentitled to immediate vesting and to receive the full benefit payment upon a change in control.\nNew Employment Agreement with the Investor Group. Concurrently with the signing of the Merger\nAgreement, Mr. Haskins entered into a new employment agreement with the Investor Group and Eureka Homestead\nto serve as Chief Financial Officer of Eureka Homestead upon consummation of the merger. The term of the\nemployment agreement is one year from the effective time of the merger with the term extending for successive one-\nyear terms at the end of the initial term until either party gives the other notice of non-renewal. The new\nemployment agreement provides Mr. Haskins an annual base salary of $205,000, as well as opportunities for\nbonuses and long-term incentive payments. If Mr. Haskins’ employment terminates during the term of the\nagreement for good reason or without cause, he will be entitled to a cash severance payment equal to 100% of his\nthen current base salary, as well as reimbursement for payments made under COBRA for the continuation of health\nbenefits. Under the agreement, Mr. Haskins is obligated to adhere to certain non-competition and non-solicitation\ncovenants for the longer of (i) 24 months from the effective date of the merger or (ii) 12 months from his\ntermination of employment, for which he will receive a lump sum cash payment at the effective time of the merger\nequal to $170,000.\nRestrictive Covenant Agreement. In connection with the merger, Mr. Heintzen entered into a restrictive\ncovenant agreement with the Investor Group. The agreement provides that for a period of two years following the\neffective time of the merger, Mr. Heintzen will not compete with Eureka Homestead and will not solicit the\ncustomers or employees of Eureka Homestead. In addition, the agreement contains customary and standard non-\ndisparagement and non-disclosure provisions. In exchange for Mr. Heintzen’s performance of the covenants set\nforth in the agreement, the agreement provides that Mr. Heintzen will receive a lump sum cash payment equal to\n$260,000 at the effective time of the merger.\nAcceleration of Vesting of Restricted Stock Awards. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp restricted stock awards that have not yet vested will become fully vested and will be exchanged\nfor the merger consideration at the completion of the merger, less applicable taxes required to be withheld. As of\nthe date of this proxy statement, there were no unvested shares of previously restricted Eureka Homestead Bancorp\ncommon stock.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan. The Eureka Homestead ESOP is a tax-qualified plan that covers the\nemployees of Eureka Homestead who have at least one year of service and have attained age 21. The ESOP received\na loan from Eureka Homestead Bancorp, the proceeds of which were used to acquire shares of Eureka Homestead\nBancorp common stock for the benefit of plan participants. The ESOP pledged the shares acquired with the loan as\ncollateral for the loan and holds them in a suspense account, releasing them to participants’ accounts as the loan is\nrepaid, primarily through contributions received from Eureka Homestead. Prior to the closing of the merger, the\nESOP will be terminated, all participants’ accounts will be fully vested and the outstanding balance of the ESOP\nloan will be repaid by the ESOP by delivering a sufficient number of unallocated shares of Eureka Homestead\n31\nBancorp common stock to Eureka Homestead Bancorp (with each share equal to the per share merger\nconsideration). All remaining shares of Eureka Homestead Bancorp common stock in the ESOP will be exchanged\nfor the per share merger consideration. Any remaining assets in the suspense account after the repayment of the\noutstanding ESOP loan will be allocated to active plan participants pro-rata as earnings based on each participant’s\naccount balance.\nAs a result of the foregoing, Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s executive officers, as well as other employees\nwho participate in the ESOP, will receive a benefit in connection with the ESOP’s termination to the extent that the\nmerger consideration (on a per share basis) multiplied by the number of shares held in the suspense account exceeds\nthe outstanding loan used to acquire those shares.\nIndemnification. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Investor Group has agreed that, for a period of six\nyears following the effective time of the merger, it will indemnify and hold harmless each of the current and former\ndirectors and officers of Eureka Homestead Bancorp and Eureka Homestead against any costs or expenses\n(including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts that are paid\nin settlement incurred in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,\nadministrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions of such persons in the course of performing their\nduties for Eureka Homestead Bancorp or Eureka Homestead occurring before the effective time of the merger to the\nfullest extent as such persons have the right to be indemnified pursuant to Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s articles of\nincorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement and as permitted by applicable law. The\nInvestor Group will also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under Eureka Homestead\nBancorp’s articles of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement and applicable law,\nprovided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is\nultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\nDirectors’ and Officers’ Insurance. Prior to closing, Eureka Homestead Bancorp will obtain and the\nInvestor Group will maintain for a period of six years after the effective time of the merger, directors’ and officers’\nliability insurance for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger with respect to the\nofficers and directors of Eureka Homestead Bancorp.\nRegulatory Approvals\nGeneral. Completion of the merger is subject to the receipt of all required approvals and consents from\nregulatory authorities. The merger is subject to approval by the Federal Reserve Board. The Investor Group has filed\nthe required regulatory applications with the Federal Reserve Board. Eureka Homestead and the Investor Group\nhave also filed a Charter Conversion Application with the OCC in connection with its business plan post-merger.\nAlthough we do not know of any reason why the regulatory approvals cannot be obtained timely, we cannot be\ncertain when or if such approvals will be obtained.\nIn addition, the proposed dividend to be paid to Eureka Homestead Bancorp stockholders at or immediately\nprior to Closing is subject to regulatory approval or non-objection.\nThe Merger. The merger of Acquisition Corp. with and into Eureka Homestead Bancorp, with Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp as the surviving corporation, requires the approval or non-objection of the Federal Reserve\nBoard.\nIn granting its approval or non-objection, the Federal Reserve Board will consider factors such as financial\nand managerial resources, future prospects, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.\nAccounting Treatment\nThe Investor Group will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting. This means that\nAcquisition Corp. and Eureka Homestead Bancorp will be treated as one company as of the date of the merger and\nthe Investor Group will record the fair value of Eureka Homestead Bancorp’s assets and liabilities on its financial\n32\nstatements on that date. The Investor Group will record the excess of its purchase price over the fair value of Eureka\nHomestead Bancorp’s identifiable net assets as goodwill.\nTerms of the Merger Agreement\nThe following describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The following description of the\nMerger Agreement is subject, and qualified in its entirety by reference, to the Merger Agreement, which is attached\nto this document as Appendix A, and is incorporated by reference into this document.

As a result of these potential adjustments, the exact per share merger\nconsideration will not be known until the closing of the merger and may be less than this amount so, in deciding\nwhether to vote to approve the Merger Agreement and the merger, a stockholder should not assume the per share\nmerger consideration will be this amount.\nSurviving Corporation, Governing Documents and Directors\nAt the effective time of the merger, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Acquisition Corp. in effect\nimmediately before the effective time of the merger will remain the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the\nsurviving corporation after completion of the merger.\nAt the effective time of the merger, the directors of Acquisition Corp. immediately before the effective time\nof the merger will continue to be the directors of the Surviving Corporation.\nClosing and Effective Time of the Merger\nThe merger will be completed only if all conditions to complete the merger set forth in the Merger\nAgreement are either satisfied or waived.

To the extent that an employee of Company\nand its subsidiaries immediately prior to the closing (collectively, the “Covered Employees”) becomes eligible to\nparticipate in an employee benefit plan maintained by the Investor Group or any of its Subsidiaries (other than\nCompany or its subsidiaries) following the closing, the Investor Group will cause such employee benefit plan to\nrecognize the service of such Covered Employee with Company or its subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility,\nparticipation, vesting and benefit accrual under such employee benefit plan of the Investor Group or any of its\nsubsidiaries, to the same extent that such service was recognized immediately prior to the effective time under a\ncorresponding Company benefit plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior\nto the effective time. However, such recognition of service will not: (i) operate to duplicate any benefits of a\nCovered Employee with respect to the same period of service; (ii) apply for purposes of any retiree medical plans or\nfor purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan; or (iii) apply for purposes of any plan,\nprogram or arrangement: (A) under which similarly situated employees of the Investor Group and its subsidiaries do\nnot receive credit for prior service; or (B) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or\nparticipation. With respect to any health care plan of the Investor Group or any of its subsidiaries (other than\nCompany and its subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate, for the plan year in which\nsuch Covered Employee is first eligible to participate, the Investor Group will make commercially reasonable efforts\nto cause any preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such Investor Group or subsidiary\nplan (excluding any Company benefit plan) to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the extent that\nsuch limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company benefit plan in which such Covered\nEmployee participated immediately prior to the effective time.\nEureka Homestead Employee Stock Ownership Plan. In accordance with the Merger Agreement, the\nCompany will take action to terminate the ESOP at least five business days before the closing date of the Merger,\nand all ESOP participants’ accounts will be fully vested.

The decrease in net loss resulted\nprimarily from an increase in noninterest income of $8,000 and a decrease in noninterest expense of $189,000, offset, in\npart, by a decrease in net interest income of $113,000.\nInterest Income. Interest income decreased $2,000, or 0.2%, to $977,000 for the three months ended September\n30, 2024 from $979,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was attributable to decreases in\ninterest on investment securities of $11,000, or 20.4%, and interest on other interest-earning assets of $30,000, or 37.5%,\noffset, in part, by an increase in interest on loans receivable of $39,000, or 4.6%. The average balance of loans decreased\n$117,000, or 0.1%, to $85.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $85.2 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023, and the average yield on loans increased 18 basis points to 4.15% for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.97% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average\nbalance of investment securities decreased $946,000, or 19.6%, to $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 from $4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and the average yield on investment securities\ndecreased four basis points to 4.43% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.47% for the three months\nended September 30, 2023. The average balance of other interest-earning assets decreased $2.2 million, or 35.6%, to $3.9\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $6.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023,\nand the average yield on other interest-earning assets decreased 16 basis points to 5.08% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from 5.24% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $111,000, or 25.9%, to $540,000 for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $429,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase\nof $174,000, or 55.6%, in interest expense on deposits, offset, in part, by a decrease of $63,000, or 54.3%, in interest\nexpense on advances from the FHLB. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $5.9 million, or 9.3%, to\n$69.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $63.2 million for the three months ended September\n30, 2023, and the average cost of interest-bearing deposits in banks increased 84 basis points to 2.82% for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.98% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The average cost of these advances decreased\n2\n{Clients/1689/4896-2172-5682-v1}\n34 basis points to 2.01% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.35% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income decreased $113,000, or 20.5%, to $437,000 for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $550,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Average net interest-earning assets\nincreased $100,000 period to period. This increase was due to the average balances of interest-earning assets shrinking\nslower than the average balances of interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest rate spread decreased 50 basis points to 1.50%\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.00% for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and our net\ninterest margin decreased 41 basis points to 1.88% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.29% for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases in interest rate spread and net interest margin were primarily the\nresult of interest rates on average interest-bearing liabilities increasing faster than interest rates on average interest-earning\nassets during the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nProvision for Credit Losses. The Bank adopted ASU 2016-13 regarding credit losses on January 1, 2023, using\nthe model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model. Adoption of this model resulted in no increase to\nour Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL). We recorded no provisions for credit losses for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 or for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses was $850,000, or\n1.01% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $850,000, or 1.00% of total loans, at December 31, 2023, and\n$850,000, or 1.01%, of total loans, at September 30, 2023. There were no non-performing loans at September 30, 2024,\nDecember 31, 2023 or September 30, 2023. Classified loans (substandard, doubtful and loss) totaled $662,000 at\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $0 at December 31, 2023 and $0 at September 30, 2023.

The increase was principally due to\nan increase of $31,000, or 91.2%, in fees on loans sold, offset, in part, by a decrease of $23,000, or 44.2%, in service\ncharges and other income.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense decreased $189,000, or 23.9%, to $603,000 for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 from $792,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily\ndue to a decrease of $188,000, or 74.0%, in accounting, consulting and legal expenses largely related to higher fees in the\n2023 quarter related the merger agreement entered in to and previously announced on August 4. 2023. Regulatory review\nof the merger is in progress.\nIncome Tax Expense. There was no income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 or for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023, principally due to net operating loss tax carryforwards from prior years. The\neffective tax rate was 0.00% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.00% for the same quarter in\n2023.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nGeneral.

The decrease in net loss resulted from\na decrease in noninterest expense of $379,000, offset, in part, by decreases in net interest income of $192,000 and in\nnoninterest income of $76,000.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased $191,000, or 6.7%, to $3.0 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was attributable to\nincreases in interest on loans receivable of $160,000, or 6.4%, and interest on other interest-earning assets of $57,000, or\n30.5%, offset, in part, by a decrease in interest on investment securities of $26,000, or 16.0%.

Average net interest-earning\nassets increased $41,000 period to period. This increase was due to the average balances of interest-earning assets\ndecreasing slower than the average balances of interest-bearing liabilities.

(the “Company”) (OTC Pink Marketplace: “ERKH”),\nthe holding company of Eureka Homestead (the “Bank”), announces net income of $3,000, or ($0.00) per basic share, for\nthe quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of ($87,000), or ($0.09) per basic share, for the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2023. Net interest income decreased $60,000 due to increased interest expense, offset, in part, by increased\ninterest income. Noninterest income decreased $53,000 principally due to fewer loans being sold in the secondary market\nand noninterest expense decreased $203,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023.\nThe decrease in noninterest expense resulted primarily from larger professional fees incurred in the 2023 quarter resulting\nprimarily from the negotiation of the definitive merger agreement which the Company entered into with Eureka Investor\nGroup Inc.

The decrease was principally due to decreases in interest-bearing deposits in banks of $5.0 million,\nin investment securities available-for-sale of $535,000 and in net loans of $561,000, offset, in part, by an increase in cash\nand cash equivalents of $3.7 million.\nNet Loans. Net loans decreased $561,000, or 0.7%, to $85.4 million at June 30, 2024 from $86.0 million at\nDecember 31, 2023.\nOne- to four-family residential real estate loans decreased $340,000, or 0.4%, to $79.9 million at June 30, 2024\nfrom $80.2 million at December 31, 2023 as normal repayments and payoffs exceeded new loan production; construction\nand land loans increased $379,000, or 33.2%, to $1.5 million at June 30, 2024 from $1.1 million at December 31, 2023;\nmultifamily loans decreased $563,000, or 22.4%, to $2.0 million at June 30, 2024 from $2.5 million at December 31, 2023\ndue to normal paydowns; commercial real estate loans decreased $27,000, or 2.0%, to $1.4 million at June 30, 2024 from\n$1.4 million at December 31, 2023 due to normal paydowns; and consumer loans increased $20,000, or 10.5%, to\n$211,000 at June 30, 2024 from $191,000 at December 31, 2023.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased $3.7 million, or 163.4%, to $5.9 million at June\n30, 2024 from $2.2 million at December 31, 2023.\nInterest-Bearing Deposits in Banks. Interest-bearing deposits in banks decreased $5.0 million, or 90.9%, to\n$500,000 at June 30, 2024 from $5.5 million at December 31, 2023.\nIn the aggregate, cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits in banks decreased $1.3 million,\nresulting primarily from the decrease in borrowings.\nSecurities Available-for-Sale. Debt securities available-for-sale, consisting of government-sponsored mortgage-\nbacked securities and SBA 7a pools backed by equipment and mortgage loans, decreased $535,000, or 12.0%, to $3.9\nmillion at June 30, 2024 from $4.5 million at December 31, 2023 as a result of normal repayments.\nDeposits. Deposits increased $95,000, or 0.1%, to $65.3 million at June 30, 2024 from $65.2 million at December\n31, 2023, principally due to an increase of $184,000 in certificates of deposit, or 0.3%, to $63.4 million at June 30, 2024\n1\nfrom $63.2 million at December 31, 2023, offset, in part, by a decrease of $89,000 in savings accounts, or 4.5%, to $1.9\nmillion at June 30, 2024 from $2.0 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in certificates of deposit resulted primarily\nfrom increases in certificates of deposit derived from an online service of $74,000 and brokered certificates of deposit of\n$498,000, offset, in part, by a decrease in retail certificates of deposit of $388,000. We have sometimes utilized the non-\nretail funding sources to fund our loan origination and growth and to replace Federal Home Loan Bank advances, as well\nas in order to get longer-term funding not always available in the local market to help manage interest rate risk.\nBorrowings. Borrowings, consisting entirely of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances decreased $2.0\nmillion, or 10.3%, to $17.3 million at June 30, 2024 from $19.3 million at December 31, 2023.\nAdvance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance.

Total equity increased $19,000, or 0.1%, to $19.2 million at June 30, 2024 from $19.2 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from the allocation of ESOP shares of $49,000, offset, in part, by the\nnet loss of $30,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2024.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nGeneral. We had a net income of $3,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of\n($87,000) for the three months ended June 30, 2023, an increase of $90,000. The increase in net income resulted primarily\nfrom a decrease in noninterest expense of $203,000, offset, in part, by decreases in net interest income of $60,000 and in\nnoninterest income of $53,000.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased $76,000, or 8.1%, to $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30,\n2024 from $942,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was attributable to increases in interest on\nloans receivable of $54,000, or 6.5%, and interest on other interest-earning assets of $34,000, or 57.6%, offset, in part, by\na decrease in interest on investment securities of $12,000, or 21.1%. The average balance of loans increased $598,000, or\n0.7%, to $85.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 from $85.3 million for the three months ended June 30,\n2023, and the average yield on loans increased 23 basis points to 4.10% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 from\n3.87% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The average balance of investment securities decreased $1.3 million, or\n24.4%, to $4.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 from $5.3 million for the three months ended June 30,\n2023, and the average yield on investment securities increased 19 basis points to 4.47% for the three months ended June\n30, 2024 from 4.28% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The average balance of other interest-earning assets\nincreased $2.2 million, or 46.0%, to $7.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 from $4.8 million for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2023, and the average yield on other interest-earning assets increased 39 basis points to\n5.32% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 from 4.93% for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $136,000, or 34.1%, to $535,000 for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024 from $399,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase of $144,000,\nor 50.9%, in interest expense on deposits, offset, in part, by a decrease of $8,000, or 6.9%, in interest expense on advances\nfrom the FHLB. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $2.5 million, or 4.0%, to $65.3 million for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2024 from $62.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, and the average cost of\ninterest-bearing deposits in banks increased 81 basis points to 2.61% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 from\n1.80% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The average balance of FHLB advances decreased $1.1 million, or\n5.4%, to $18.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 from $19.8 million for the three months ended June 30,\n2023. The average cost of these advances decreased four basis points to 2.31% for the three months ended June 30, 2024\nfrom 2.35% for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income decreased $60,000, or 11.0%, to $483,000 for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024 from $543,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Average net interest-earning assets increased\n$22,000 period to period, as the average balances of interest-earning assets grew faster than the average balances of\ninterest-bearing liabilities. Our interest rate spread decreased 37 basis points to 1.65% for the three months ended June 30,\n2\n2024 from 2.02% for the three months ended June 30, 2023, and our net interest margin decreased 29 basis points to\n1.99% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 from 2.28% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decreases in\ninterest rate spread and net interest margin were primarily the result of interest rates on average interest-bearing liabilities\nincreasing faster than interest rates on average interest-earning assets during the three months ended June 30, 2024 versus\nthe three months ended June 30, 2023.\nProvision for Credit Losses. The Bank adopted ASU 2016-13 regarding credit losses on January 1, 2023, using\nthe model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model. Adoption of this model resulted in no increase to\nour Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL). We recorded no provisions for credit losses for the three months ended June 30,\n2024 or for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses was $850,000, or 1.00% of total loans,\nat June 30, 2024, compared to $850,000, or 0.99% of total loans, at December 31, 2023, and $850,000, or 1.02%, of total\nloans, at June 30, 2023. There were two loans totaling $662,000 classified as substandard at June 30, 2024 and no loans\nclassified (substandard, doubtful and loss) at December 31, 2023 or June 30, 2023. There were no non-performing loans at\nJune 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 or June 30, 2023. There were no charge-offs or recoveries for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024 or for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased $53,000, or 34.4%, to $101,000 for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024 from $154,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was principally due to a decrease of\n$58,000, or 53.2%, in fees on loans sold.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense decreased $203,000, or 25.9%, to $581,000 for the three months\nended June 30, 2024 from $784,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to\ndecreases of $61,000, or 14.9%, in salaries and employee benefits, resulting primarily from a decrease in commissions\nand related expenses on lower loan volume period to period, and of $150,000, or 76.9%, in accounting, consulting and\nlegal expenses from fees incurred in the 2023 quarter resulting primarily from the negotiation of the definitive merger\nagreement which the Company entered into and previously announced on August 4. 2023.\nIncome Tax Expense. There was no income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 or for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2023, principally due to net operating loss tax carryforwards from prior years. The effective\ntax rate was 0.00% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 0.00% for the same quarter in 2023.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nGeneral. We had a net loss of ($30,000) for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of\n($58,000) for the six months ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of $28,000. The decrease in net loss resulted from a\ndecrease in noninterest expense of $190,000, offset, in part, by a decrease in net interest income of $79,000 and a decrease\nin noninterest income of $83,000.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased $193,000, or 10.4%, to $2.1 million for the six months ended June 30,\n2024 from $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase was attributable to increases in interest on\nloans receivable of $121,000, or 7.4%, and interest on other interest-earning assets of $87,000, or 82.1%, offset, in part,\nby a decrease in interest on investment securities of $15,000, or 13.8%. The average balance of loans increased $140,000,\nor 0.2%, to $85.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from $85.8 million for the six months ended June 30,\n2023, and the average yield on loans increased 27 basis points to 4.11% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from\n3.84% for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The average balance of investment securities decreased $1.1 million, or\n21.2%, to $4.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from $5.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023,\nwhile the average yield on investment securities increased 39 basis points to 4.49% for the six months ended June 30,\n2024 from 4.10% for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The average balance of other interest-earning assets increased\n$2.6 million, or 57.2%, to $7.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from $4.6 million for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2023, and the average yield on other interest-earning assets increased 73 basis points to 5.37% for the six months\nended June 30, 2024 from 4.64% for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $272,000, or 35.7%, to $1.0 million for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024 from $762,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase of $285,000, or\n3\n53.8%, in interest expense on deposits, offset, in part, by a decrease of $13,000, or 5.6%, in interest expense on advances\nfrom the FHLB. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $2.4 million, or 3.8%, to $65.2 million for the\nsix months ended June 30, 2024 from $62.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and the average cost of\ninterest-bearing deposits in banks increased 81 basis points to 2.50% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from 1.69%\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2023. The average balance of FHLB advances decreased $767,000, or 3.9%, to $19.0\nmillion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from $19.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The average\ncost of these advances decreased four basis points to 2.31% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from 2.35% for the\nsix months ended June 30, 2023.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income decreased $79,000, or 7.2%, to $1.0 million for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024 from $1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Average net interest-earning assets increased\n$17,000 period to period, as the average balances of interest-earning assets grew faster than the average balances of\ninterest-bearing liabilities. Our interest rate spread decreased 29 basis points to 1.76% for the six months ended June 30,\n2024 from 2.05% for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and our net interest margin decreased 20 basis points to 2.10%\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2024 from 2.30% for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decreases in interest rate\nspread and net interest margin were primarily the result of interest rates on average interest-bearing liabilities increasing\nfaster than interest rates on average interest-earning assets during the six months ended June 30, 2024 versus the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023.\nProvision for Credit Losses. The Bank adopted ASU 2016-13 regarding credit losses on January 1, 2023, using\nthe model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model.

Noninterest expense decreased $190,000, or 13.6%, to $1.2 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2024 from $1.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to\ndecreases of $109,000, or 13.7%, in salaries and employee benefits, resulting primarily from a decrease in commissions\nand related expenses on lower loan volume period to period, and a decrease of $98,000, or 40.3%, in accounting,\nconsulting and legal expenses from fees incurred in the six months ended June 30, 2023 resulting primarily from the\nnegotiation of the definitive merger agreement which the Company entered into and previously announced on August 4.\n2023.\nIncome Tax Expense. There was no income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 or for the\nsix months ended June 30, 2023, principally due to net operating loss tax carryforwards from prior years.

(the “Company”) (OTC Pink Marketplace: “ERKH”),\nthe holding company of Eureka Homestead (the “Bank”), announces a net loss of ($33,000), or ($0.04) per basic share, for\nthe quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to net income of $29,000, or $0.03 per basic share, for the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2023. Net interest income decreased $18,000 due to increased interest expense, offset, in part, by increased\ninterest income. Noninterest income decreased $31,000 principally due to fewer loans being sold in the secondary market\nand noninterest expense increased $13,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023\nprincipally due to increased professional fees related to the Company’s proposed merger which was announced on August\n4, 2023.\nComparison of Financial Condition at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023\nTotal Assets. Total assets decreased $289,000, or 0.3%, to $105.1 million at March 31, 2024 from $105.4 million\nat December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to decreases in investment securities available-for-sale of $295,000 and in\ninterest-bearing deposits in banks of $1.0 million, offset, in part, by increases in cash and cash equivalents of $717,000\nand in net loans of $283,000.\nNet Loans. Net loans increased $283,000, or 0.3%, to $86.3 million at March 31, 2024 from $86.0 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. The increase in net loans was due primarily to increases in one- to four-family residential real estate\nloans and construction and land loans.\nOne- to four-family residential real estate loans increased $109,000, or 0.1%, to $80.3 million at March 31, 2024\nfrom $80.2 million at December 31, 2023, construction and land loans increased $209,000, or 18.3%, to $1.4 million at\nMarch 31, 2024 from $1.1 million at December 31, 2023, multifamily loans decreased $18,000, or 0.7%, to $2.5 million\nat March 31, 2024 from $2.5 million at December 31, 2023, commercial real estate loans decreased $14,000, or 1.0%, to\n$1.4 million at March 31, 2024 from $1.4 million at December 31, 2023 and consumer loans increased $3,000, or 1.6%, to\n$194,000 at March 31, 2024 from $191,000 at December 31, 2023.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased $717,000, or 31.8%, to $3.0 million at March\n31, 2024 from $2.3 million at December 31, 2023.\nInterest-Bearing Deposits in Banks. Interest-bearing deposits in banks decreased $1.0 million, or 18.1%, to $4.5\nmillion at March 31, 2024 from $5.5 million at December 31, 2023.\nIn the aggregate, cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits in banks increased $279,000, resulting\nprimarily due to the decrease in debt securities available-for-sale.\nDebt Securities Available-for-Sale. Debt securities available-for-sale, consisting of government-sponsored\nmortgage-backed securities and SBA 7a pools backed by equipment and mortgage loans, decreased $295,000, or 6.6%, to\n$4.2 million at March 31, 2024 from $4.5 million at December 31, 2023 as a result of normal repayments.\nDeposits. Deposits increased $290,000, or 0.4%, to $65.5 million at March 31, 2024 from $65.2 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, principally due to an increase of $377,000 in certificates of deposit, or 0.6%, to $63.6 million at\nMarch 31, 2024 from $63.2 million at December 31, 2023, offset, in part, by a decrease of $87,000 in savings accounts, or\n1\n4.4%, to $1.9 million at March 31, 2024 from $2.0 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in certificates of deposit\nresulted primarily from an increase in certificates of deposit derived from an online service of $374,000. We have\nsometimes utilized the non-retail funding sources to fund our loan origination and growth and to replace Federal Home\nLoan Bank advances, as well as in order to get longer-term funding not always available in the local market to help\nmanage interest rate risk.\nBorrowings. Borrowings, consisting entirely of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, were flat, at $19.3\nmillion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nAdvance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance. Advance payments by borrowers for taxes and\ninsurance decreased $565,000, or 51.8%, to $526,000 at March 31, 2024 from $1.1 million at December 31, 2023 due to\nnormal payments for real estate taxes due in the first quarter of each year.\nTotal Equity. Total equity decreased $7,000, or 0.0%, to $19.2 million at March 31, 2024 from $19.2 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 as the net loss of $33,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was offset, in part, by a\ndecrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $3,000 and the allocation of ESOP shares of $23,000.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nGeneral. We had a net loss of ($33,000) for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to net income of\n$29,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, a decrease of $62,000. The decrease in net income resulted from\ndecreases in net interest income of $18,000 and in noninterest income of $31,000 and an increase in noninterest expense\nof $13,000.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased $117,000, or 12.7%, to $1 million for the three months ended March\n31, 2024 from $918,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase was attributable to increases in interest\non loans receivable of $67,000, or 8.2%, and in interest on other interest-earning assets of $54,000, or 114.9%, offset, in\npart, by a decrease in interest on investment securities of $4,000, or 7.7%. The average balance of loans decreased\n$325,000, or 0.4%, to $85.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $86.2 million for the three months\nended March 31, 2023, and the average yield on loans increased 32 basis points to 4.12% for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 from 3.80% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The average balance of investment securities\ndecreased $1.0 million, or 18.0%, to $4.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $5.3 million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023, while the average yield on investment securities increased 50 basis points to 4.41%\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2024 from 3.91% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The average balance\nof other interest-earning assets increased $3.0 million, or 69.6%, to $7.4 million for the three months ended March 31,\n2024 from $4.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, and the average yield on other interest-earning assets\nincreased 116 basis points to 5.48% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from 4.32% for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $135,000, or 37.2%, to $498,000 for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 from $363,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase was due to an increase of\n$141,000, or 57.1%, in interest expense on deposits, offset, in part, by a decrease of $6,000, or 5.2%, in interest expense\non advances from the FHLB. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $2.2 million, or 3.5%, to $65.2\nmillion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $63.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, and\nthe average cost of interest-bearing deposits in banks increased 81 basis points to 2.38% for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 from 1.57% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The average balance of FHLB advances\ndecreased $475,000, or 2.4%, to $19.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $19.7 million for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023. The average cost of these advances decreased seven basis points to 2.28% for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2024 from 2.35% for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income decreased $18,000, or 3.2%, to $537,000 for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 from $555,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Average net interest-earning assets increased\n$16,000 period to period. Our interest rate spread decreased 19 basis points to 1.88% for the three months ended March\n31, 2024 from 2.07% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, and our net interest margin decreased 12 basis points to\n2\n2.21% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from 2.33% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decreases\nin interest rate spread and net interest margin were primarily the result of interest rates on average interest-earning assets\nincreasing slower than interest rates on average interest-bearing liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2024\nversus the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nProvision for Credit Losses. We recorded no provisions for credit losses for the three months ended March 31,\n2024 or for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses was $850,000, or 0.99% of total\nloans, at March 31, 2024, compared to $850,000, or 0.99% of total loans, at December 31, 2023, and $850,000, or 1.00%,\nof total loans, at March 31, 2023. There was one classified loan rated substandard in the amount of $253,000 with no\nestimated loss and no non-performing loans at March 31, 2024 and no classified (substandard, doubtful and loss) or non-\nperforming loans at December 31, 2023 or March 31, 2023. There were no charge-offs or recoveries for the three months\nended March 31, 2024 or for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased $31,000, or 36.0%, to $55,000 for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 from $86,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease was principally due to a decrease\nof $36,000, or 85.7%, in fees on loans sold.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $13,000, or 2.1%, to $625,000 for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024 from $612,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase\nin professional fees related to the Company’s proposed merger, which was announced on August 4, 2023, offset, in part,\nby a decrease of $47,000, or 12.2%, in salaries and employee benefits, resulting primarily from a decrease in commissions\nand related expenses on lower loan volume period to period.\nIncome Tax Expense. There was no income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 or for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023, principally due to net operating loss tax carryforwards from prior years.
