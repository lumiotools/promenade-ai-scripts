Parts and services organic revenue decreased 2.8% (4.3% decrease on a per day basis), the net\nimpact of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue by 3.1%, and foreign exchange rates increased revenue by\n0.4% year over year, for a total parts and services revenue increase of 0.6%. Other revenue fell 2.2% primarily due\nto lower commodities prices and volumes relative to the same period in 2023.\nNet income2 was $191 million compared to $207 million for the same period of 2023. Diluted earnings per share2\nwas $0.73 compared to $0.77 for the same period of 2023, a decrease of 5.2%.\nOn an adjusted basis, net income1,2 was $230 million compared to $231 million for the same period of 2023, a\ndecrease of 0.3%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share1,2 was $0.88 compared to $0.86 for the same period of 2023,\nan increase of 2.3%.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet\nCash flow from operations and free cash flow1 were $420 million and $341 million, respectively, for the third\nquarter of 2024. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow1 were $886 million and $661 million, respectively,\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the balance sheet reflected total debt of\n$4.4 billion and total leverage, as defined in our credit facility, was 2.4x EBITDA.\n(1) Non-GAAP measure. See the table accompanying this release that reconciles the actual or forecasted U.S.\nGAAP measure to the actual or forecasted adjusted measure, which is non-GAAP.\n(2) References in this release to Net income and Diluted earnings per share, and the corresponding adjusted figures,\nreflect amounts from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders."

The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes\nthe impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency revenue information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth,\nconsistent with how we evaluate our performance, as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational\nperformance. Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating prior year revenue in local currency using the current year's currency conversion rate. This non-GAAP financial\nmeasure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our use of this term may vary from\nthe use of similarly-titled measures by other issuers due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. In addition, not all\ncompanies that report revenue growth on a constant currency basis calculate such measure in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to\nsimilarly-named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.\n15\nAppendix 2\nRevenue and Segment EBITDA by segment\nThree Months Ended September 30\n% of % of\n(in millions) 2024 revenue 2023 revenue\nRevenue\nWholesale - North America $1,423 $1,387\nEurope 1,613 1,584\nSpecialty 419 457\nSelf Service 131 141\nEliminations (2) (1)\nTotal Revenue $3,584 $3,568\nSegment EBITDA\nWholesale - North America $228 16.1% $236 17.0%\nEurope 165 10.2% 147 9.3%\nSpecialty 31 7.3% 40 8.6%\nSelf Service 10 7.3% (1) (0.6)%\nTotal Segment EBITDA $434 12.1% $422 11.8%\nWe have presented Segment EBITDA solely as a supplemental disclosure that offers investors, securities analysts and other interested parties useful information to evaluate our segment profit\nand loss and underlying trends in our ongoing operations. We calculate Segment EBITDA as Net Income excluding net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interest; income and loss\nfrom discontinued operations; depreciation; amortization; interest; gains and losses on debt extinguishment; income tax expense; restructuring and transaction related expenses; change in fair\nvalue of contingent consideration liabilities; other gains and losses related to acquisitions, equity method investments, or divestitures; equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries;\nequity investment fair value adjustments; impairment charges; and direct impacts of the Ukraine/Russia conflict. Our chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, uses\nSegment EBITDA as the key measure of our segment profit or loss. We use Segment EBITDA to compare profitability among our segments and evaluate business strategies. This financial\nmeasure is included in the metrics used to determine incentive compensation for our senior management. We also consider Segment EBITDA to be a useful financial measure in evaluating our\noperating performance, as it provides investors, securities analysts and other interested parties with supplemental information regarding the underlying trends in our ongoing operations. Segment\nEBITDA includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. Corporate general and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared\nexpenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue. Refer to the table on the following page for a reconciliation of net income to Segment EBITDA.\n16\nAppendix 3\nReconciliation of Net Income to Segment EBITDA\nThree Months Ended September 30 We have presented Segment EBITDA solely as a\n(in millions) 2024 2023 supplemental disclosure that offers investors,\nsecurities analysts and other interested parties useful\nNet income $192 $208 information to evaluate our segment profit and loss\nLess: net income attributable to continuing noncontrolling interest 1 — and underlying trends in our ongoing operations.

We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share as Net Income and Diluted Earnings\nper Share adjusted to eliminate the impact of net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, income and loss from discontinued operations, restructuring and transaction related\nexpenses, amortization expense related to all acquired intangible assets, gains and losses on debt extinguishment, changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, other gains and\nlosses related to acquisitions, equity method investments, or divestitures, impairment charges, direct impacts of the Ukraine/Russia conflict, interest and financing costs related to the Uni-Select\ntransaction prior to closing, excess tax benefits and deficiencies from stock-based payments and any tax effect of these adjustments. The tax effect of these adjustments is calculated using the\neffective tax rate for the applicable period or for certain discrete items the specific tax expense or benefit for the adjustment. Given the variability and volatility of the amount of related\ntransactions in a particular period, management believes that these costs are not core operating expenses and should be adjusted in our calculation of Adjusted Net Income. Our adjustment of\nthe amortization of all acquisition-related intangible assets does not exclude the amortization of other assets, which represents expense that is directly attributable to ongoing operations.\nManagement believes that the adjustment relating to amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the\ncomparability of operating performance. The acquired intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that\nrelate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.\nThese financial measures are used by management in its decision making and overall evaluation of our operating performance and are included in the metrics used to determine incentive\ncompensation for our senior management. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share should not be construed as alternatives to Net Income or Diluted Earnings per Share as\ndetermined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, not all companies that report measures similar to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted\nDiluted Earnings per Share calculate such measures in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other\ncompanies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.\n19\nAppendix 5\nForecasted EPS and Free Cash Flow Reconciliation\nForecasted Fiscal Year 2024\n(in millions, except per share data) Minimum Outlook Maximum Outlook\nNet income(1) $686 $723\nAdjustments:\nAmortization of acquired intangibles 147 147\nRestructuring and transaction related expenses 121 121\nTax effect of adjustments (60) (60)\nAdjusted net income(1) $894 $931\nWeighted average diluted common shares outstanding 264.4 264.4\nDiluted EPS:\nReported(1) $2.59 $2.73\nAdjusted(1) $3.38 $3.52\n(1) Actuals and outlook figures are for continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders\nWe have presented forecasted Adjusted Net Income and forecasted Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share in our financial outlook.

In the calculation of forecasted Adjusted Net Income and forecasted Adjusted\nDiluted Earnings per Share, we included estimates of net income, amortization of acquired intangibles for the full fiscal year 2024, restructuring expenses under previously announced plans,\nand the related tax effect; we included for all other components the amounts incurred through September 30, 2024.\nForecasted Fiscal Year 2024\n(in millions) Outlook\nNet cash provided by operating activities $1,175\nLess: purchases of property, plant and equipment 325\nFree cash flow $850\nWe have presented forecasted free cash flow in our financial outlook.

We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property, plant and equipment. We believe free cash flow provides insight into\nour liquidity and provides useful information to management and investors concerning our cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital\nrequirements, make strategic acquisitions, pay dividends and repurchase stock. We believe free cash flow is used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in\nevaluating the liquidity of other companies, many of which present free cash flow when reporting their results. This financial measure is included in the metrics used to determine\nincentive compensation for our senior management. Free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities, as determined in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, not all companies that report free cash flow information calculate free cash flow in the\nsame manner as we do and, accordingly, our calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other companies and may not be an appropriate measure\nfor liquidity relative to other companies.\nWe also evaluate our free cash flow by measuring the conversion of Adjusted EBITDA into free cash flow. For the denominator of our conversion ratio, we calculate Adjusted\nEBITDA as Net Income excluding net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, income and loss from discontinued operations, depreciation, amortization, interest,\ngains and losses on debt extinguishment, income tax expense, gains and losses on the disposal of businesses, and other unusual income and expense items that affect investing\nor financing cash flows. We exclude gains and losses on the disposal of businesses as the proceeds are included in investing cash flows, which is outside of free cash flow.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income, net income or net cash provided by operating activities, as determined in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, not all companies that report Adjusted EBITDA information calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same\nmanner as we do and, accordingly, our calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other companies and may not be an appropriate measure for\nperformance relative to other companies.\n22\nAppendix 7: Metals Prices & Foreign Exchange\nQ3 2024 vs Q3 2023 Segment EBITDA Impact\nAverage Metals Prices\nWholesale - North\n($ in millions) Self Service America Total\nScrap Steel $5 $(3) $2\n$239\n$227 $229 Precious Metals $(1) $(1) $(2)\n$200\n$209\n$203\n$196 $196 Total $4 $(4) $—\n$151\n$138\n$126\n$110\n$99 $99 $98 $100 $97\n$100\n$98 $95 $96 $95 $97\n$91\nForeign Exchange\n$58 YoY Impact Q3 2024 Q3 2023\n$37 $39 $43 $45 $45 GBP 2.7% 1.30 1.27\n$— EUR 1.0% 1.10 1.09\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3\nCAD (1.7)% 0.73 0.75\n2023 2023 2023 2023 2024 2024 2024\nQ3 2024\nScrap Steel per ton GAAP EPS(1) Impact $(0.06)\nPalladium per .1 Troy oz Adjusted EPS\n$—\nPlatinum per .1 Troy oz Impact\nRhodium per .01 Troy oz\n(1) Includes gains on foreign exchange contracts related to the Uni-Select acquisition of $3 million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023 (including the related tax effects); excluded from\nAdjusted EPS\n23"

Interim Financial Statements\nLKQ Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is a holding company and all operations are conducted by subsidiaries. When the\nterms \"LKQ,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\" are used in this document, those terms refer to LKQ Corporation and its\nconsolidated subsidiaries.\nWe have prepared the accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements pursuant to the rules and\nregulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") applicable to interim financial statements. Accordingly,\ncertain information related to our significant accounting policies and footnote disclosures normally included in financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\")\nhave been condensed or omitted. These Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect, in the opinion of\nmanagement, all material adjustments (which include only normally recurring adjustments) necessary to fairly state, in all\nmaterial respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.\nWe have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation.\nResults for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for any subsequent interim period or\nfor a full year. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial\nstatements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the\nSEC on February 22, 2024 (\"2023 Form 10-K\").\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-04, \"Liabilities—Supplier Finance\nPrograms (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\" (\"ASU 2022-04\"), which requires the buyer\nin a supplier finance program to disclose certain information about its program, including key terms, balance sheet presentation\nof amounts, outstanding amounts at the end of each period, and rollforwards of balances. We adopted the provisions of ASU\n2022-04 on a retrospective basis (see Note 12, \"Supply Chain Financing\"), except for the disclosure of rollforward information,\nwhich will be adopted prospectively in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2024 as required.\nThe adoption of ASU 2022-04 did not have a material impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, \"Segment\nReporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\" The ASU expands public entities’ segment\ndisclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision\nmaker (\"CODM\") and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its\ncomposition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. The ASU is\neffective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We expect the adoption of this standard will not materially\nimpact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, but will result in additional disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, \"Income\nTaxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.\" The ASU requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes\npaid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-\nrelated disclosures. The ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires prospective\napplication with the option to apply it retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of\nadopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\n9\nNote 2. Business Combinations\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed acquisitions of six businesses within our Wholesale - North\nAmerica segment and two businesses within our Europe segment. These acquisitions were not material to our financial position\nor results of operations as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, in January 2024, we\npaid $23 million (€21 million) to a minority shareholder to settle a put option exercised on redeemable shares issued in\nconjunction with a previous acquisition. This payment was presented within Other financing activities, net in financing\nactivities in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nIn February 2023, we entered into a plan of arrangement to acquire all of Uni-Select's issued and outstanding shares. On August\n1, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Uni-Select for an aggregate consideration paid of approximately Canadian dollar\n(“CAD”) 2.8 billion ($2.1 billion) (the \"Uni-Select Acquisition\"). In order to reduce the risk related to changes in CAD foreign\nexchange rates for the CAD purchase price, we entered into foreign exchange contracts. These foreign exchange contracts did\nnot qualify for hedge accounting, and therefore the changes in fair value were reported in Gains on foreign exchange contracts -\nacquisition related in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. We reported Gains on foreign exchange\ncontracts - acquisition related of $3 million and $49 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nrespectively. These foreign exchange contracts were settled in July 2023 ahead of closing of the Uni-Select Acquisition,\nresulting in total payments received of $49 million. See Note 14, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" for\ninformation related to these foreign exchange contracts.\nIn addition to our acquisition of Uni-Select, we completed acquisitions of three businesses within our Wholesale - North\nAmerica segment, four businesses within our Europe segment and one business in our Specialty segment, during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no significant adjustments to the preliminary purchase\nprice allocations from those disclosed in our December 31, 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUnaudited Pro Forma Financial Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the effect of the businesses acquired during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 as though the businesses had been acquired as of January 1, 2023, and the businesses acquired\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023 as though they had been acquired as of January 1, 2022. The unaudited pro forma\nfinancial information is based upon accounting estimates and judgments that we believe are reasonable. The unaudited pro\nforma financial information includes the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, such as the adjustment of inventory\nacquired to fair value, adjustments to depreciation on acquired property, plant and equipment, adjustments to rent expense for\nabove or below market leases, adjustments to amortization on acquired intangible assets, adjustments to interest expense, and\nthe related tax effects. These pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred if the acquisitions\nhad been in effect for the periods presented or of future results. The unaudited pro forma financial information is as follows (in\nmillions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue $ 3,585 $ 3,714 $ 11,022 $ 11,382\nIncome from continuing operations 192 201 537 685\nThe pro forma impact of our acquisitions also reflects the elimination of acquisition related expenses (net of tax) of $3 million\nand $17 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and gains on foreign exchange contracts\n- acquisition related of $3 million and $49 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Refer\nto Note 9, \"Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses\" for further information regarding our acquisition related expenses.\n10\nNote 3. Discontinued Operations\nAs part of the Uni-Select transaction, we were required to divest its United Kingdom (\"U.K.\") subsidiary, GSF Car Parts, to\ncomply with the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority regulatory ruling. Since the GSF Car Parts business was held\nseparate and never integrated into our business, we classified the business as discontinued operations upon acquisition.\nIn October 2023, we completed the divestment of GSF Car Parts resulting in an immaterial loss on sale. In order to manage our\nexposure to variability in the cash flows related the sale of GSF Car Parts, we entered into a foreign exchange forward contract\nto fix the amount of USD we received upon completion of the sale. This foreign exchange contract was settled in October 2023.\nNote 4. Inventories\nWe classify our inventory into the following categories: (i) aftermarket and refurbished products, (ii) salvage and\nremanufactured products, and (iii) manufactured products.\nInventories consist of the following (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAftermarket and refurbished products $ 2,576 $ 2,556\nSalvage and remanufactured products 503 510\nManufactured products 53 55\nTotal inventories $ 3,132 $ 3,121\nAftermarket and refurbished products and salvage and remanufactured products are primarily composed of finished goods. As\nof September 30, 2024, manufactured products inventory was composed of $26 million of raw materials, $7 million of work in\nprocess, and $20 million of finished goods. As of December 31, 2023, manufactured products inventory was composed of\n$26 million of raw materials, $7 million of work in process, and $22 million of finished goods.\nNote 5. Allowance for Credit Losses\nOur allowance for credit losses was $61 million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The provision for\ncredit losses was $7 million and $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and $11 million and\n$7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNote 6. Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually. We performed our annual\nimpairment test during the fourth quarter of 2023, and determined no impairment existed as all of our reporting units had a fair\nvalue estimate which exceeded the carrying value by at least 20%. The fair value estimates of our reporting units were\nestablished using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples\napproach. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing may also be performed on an interim basis when\nevents or circumstances arise that may lead to impairment. We did not identify any indicators of impairment in the first nine\nmonths of 2024 that necessitated an interim test of goodwill impairment or indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment.\n11\nNote 7. Equity Method Investments\nThe carrying value of our Equity method investments were as follows (in millions):\nSegment Ownership as of September 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nMEKO AB (1) Europe 26.6% $ 147 $ 145\nOther 12 14\nTotal $ 159 $ 159\n(1) As of September 30, 2024, the Level 1 fair value of our investment in MEKO AB (\"Mekonomen\") was $202 million based\non the quoted market price for Mekonomen's common stock using the same foreign exchange rate as the carrying value.\nOur share of the book value of Mekonomen's net assets exceeded the book value of our investment by $10 million; this\ndifference is primarily related to Mekonomen's Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income balance as of our acquisition\ndate in 2016. We record our equity in the net earnings of Mekonomen on a one quarter lag.\nNote 8. Revenue Recognition\nDisaggregated Revenue\nWe report revenue in two categories: (i) parts and services and (ii) other.\nParts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products including replacement parts, components and systems used in the\nrepair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty products and accessories to improve the performance, functionality and\nappearance of vehicles. Services revenue includes (i) additional services that are generally billed concurrently with the related\nproduct sales, such as the sale of service-type warranties, (ii) fees for admission to our self service yards, and (iii) diagnostic\nand repair services.\nFor Wholesale - North America and Self Service, vehicle replacement products include sheet metal collision parts such as\ndoors, hoods, and fenders; bumper covers; head and tail lamps; mirrors; grilles; wheels; and large mechanical items such as\nengines and transmissions. For Europe, and to a lesser extent for Wholesale - North America, vehicle replacement products\ninclude a wide variety of small mechanical products such as brake pads, discs and sensors; clutches; electrical products such as\nspark plugs and batteries; steering and suspension products; filters; and oil and automotive fluids. Additionally, in both our\nWholesale - North America and Europe segments, we sell paint and paint related consumables for refinishing vehicles. For our\nSpecialty operations, we serve seven product segments: truck and off-road; speed and performance; recreational vehicles;\ntowing; wheels, tires and performance handling; marine; and miscellaneous accessories.\nOther revenue includes sales of scrap and precious metals (platinum, palladium, and rhodium), bulk sales to mechanical\nmanufacturers (including cores) and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from furnace operations. We derive scrap metal and\nother precious metals from several sources in both our Wholesale - North America and Self Service segments, including\nvehicles that have been used in our recycling operations and vehicles from original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") and\nother entities that contract with us for secure disposal of \"crush only\" vehicles. Revenue from the sale of hulks in our Wholesale\n- North America and Self Service segments is recognized based on a price per ton of delivered material when the customer\n(processor) collects the scrap.\n12\nThe following table sets forth our revenue disaggregated by category and reportable segment (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nWholesale - North America $ 1,349 $ 1,312 $ 4,169 $ 3,581\nEurope 1,609 1,581 4,879 4,762\nSpecialty 417 456 1,305 1,294\nSelf Service 52 58 161 181\nParts and services 3,427 3,407 10,514 9,818\nWholesale - North America 74 75 227 234\nEurope 4 3 17 15\nSelf Service 79 83 240 298\nOther 157 161 484 547\nTotal revenue $ 3,584 $ 3,568 $ 10,998 $ 10,365\nVariable Consideration\nAmounts related to variable consideration on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows (in\nmillions):\nClassification September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nReturn asset Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 71 $ 68\nRefund liability Refund liability 135 132\nVariable consideration reserve Receivables, net of allowance for credit losses 157 155\nRevenue by Geographic Area\nOur net sales are attributed to geographic area based on the location of the selling operation. The following table sets forth our\nrevenue by geographic area (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue\nUnited States $ 1,679 $ 1,759 $ 5,243 $ 5,130\nGermany 444 418 1,314 1,270\nUnited Kingdom 430 438 1,298 1,275\nOther countries 1,031 953 3,143 2,690\nTotal revenue $ 3,584 $ 3,568 $ 10,998 $ 10,365\n13\nNote 9. Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses\nFrom time to time, we initiate restructuring plans to integrate acquired businesses, to align our workforce with strategic\nbusiness activities, or to improve efficiencies in our operations. Below is a summary of our current restructuring plans:\n2024 Global Restructuring Plan\nIn the first quarter of 2024, we began a global restructuring initiative focused on enhancing profitability. This initiative includes\nexiting businesses and markets that do not align with our strategic objectives and executing on opportunities to reduce costs,\nstreamline operations and consolidate facilities. As we move forward with our plan, we will incur impairments and other\ncharges related to the disposal of long-lived assets, inventory, and other assets; costs for employee severance; lease termination\ncharges and facility closure costs; and other contract termination charges. We expect that the largest portion of the activity will\ncome from the Europe segment. In the second quarter of 2024, we divested our operations in Slovenia. In the third quarter of\n2024, we divested our operations in Poland to Mekonomen, an equity method investment of which we own 26.6%, which\nclosed in July 2024 and we divested our operations in Bosnia, which closed in September 2024. Our decision to exit these\nmarkets constituted a triggering event to evaluate certain long-lived assets for impairment, and as a result, we incurred\nimpairment charges with the divestiture of Slovenia, Poland, and Bosnia. This plan is scheduled to be substantially complete by\nthe end of 2025 with an estimated total incurred cost of between $100 million and $120 million. In the future, we may identify\nadditional initiatives under the plan that may result in additional expenditures, although we are currently unable to estimate the\nrange of charges for such potential future initiatives.\n2022 Global Restructuring Plan\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began a restructuring initiative covering all of our reportable segments designed to reduce\ncosts, streamline operations, consolidate facilities and implement other strategic changes to the overall organization. We have\nincurred and expect to incur costs primarily for employee severance, inventory or other asset write-downs, and exiting facilities.\nThis plan is scheduled to be substantially complete by the end of 2024 with an estimated total incurred cost of approximately\n$30 million.\n1 LKQ Europe Plan\nIn 2019, we announced a multi-year plan called \"1 LKQ Europe\" which is intended to create structural centralization and\nstandardization of key functions to facilitate the operation of the Europe segment as a single business. Under the 1 LKQ Europe\nplan, we are reorganizing our non-customer-facing teams and support systems through various projects including the\nimplementation of a common Enterprise Resource Planning platform, rationalization of our product portfolio, and creation of a\nEurope headquarters office and central back office. We completed the organizational design and implementation projects in\nJune 2021, with the remaining projects scheduled to be completed by the end of 2027 with a total incurred cost of between\n$30 million and $40 million.\nAcquisition Integration Plans\nAs we complete the acquisition of a business, we may incur costs related to integrating the acquired business into our current\nbusiness structure and systems. These costs are typically incurred within a year from the acquisition date and vary in magnitude\ndepending on the size and complexity of the related integration activities. We expect to incur additional expenses of\napproximately $2 million by the end of 2024 to substantially complete the integration plan related to the Uni-Select Acquisition\nin our Wholesale - North America segment.\n14\nThe following table sets forth the expenses incurred related to our restructuring plans (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nPlan Expense Type 2024 2023 2024 2023\n2024 Global Plan Employee related costs $ 10 $ — $ 13 $ —\nFacility exit costs 4 — 4 —\nInventory related costs (1) — — 14 —\nAsset impairments (2) — — 46 —\nOther costs — — 7 —\nTotal $ 14 $ — $ 84 $ —\n2022 Global Plan Employee related costs $ — $ 1 $ 1 $ 3\nFacility exit costs 1 2 2 5\nInventory related costs (1) — 2 — 2\nOther costs — 1 — 3\nTotal $ 1 $ 6 $ 3 $ 13\n1 LKQ Europe Plan Employee related costs $ — $ — $ 2 $ 1\nFacility exit costs — — 1 —\nInventory related costs (1) 1 — 1 —\nTotal $ 1 $ — $ 4 $ 1\nAcquisition Integration\nPlans Employee related costs $ — $ 20 $ 4 $ 20\nFacility exit costs 4 — 13 2\nOther costs — — 3 —\nTotal $ 4 $ 20 $ 20 $ 22\nTotal restructuring\nexpenses $ 20 $ 26 $ 111 $ 36\n(1) Recorded to Cost of goods sold in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\n(2) Related to impairment of assets in Property, plant and equipment, net and Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table sets forth the cumulative plan costs by segment related to our restructuring plans (in millions):\nCumulative Program Costs\nWholesale -\nNorth Self\nAmerica Europe Specialty Service Total\n2024 Global Plan $ 12 $ 72 $ — $ — $ 84\n2022 Global Plan 2 19 4 3 28\n1 LKQ Europe Plan — 14 — — 14\nTransaction Related Expenses\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred expenses totaling $1 million and $3 million,\nrespectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred expenses totaling $3 million and\n$19 million, respectively, for legal, accounting and advisory services related to completed and potential transactions.\n15\nNote 10. Earnings Per Share\nThe following chart sets forth the computation of earnings per share (in millions, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nIncome from continuing operations $ 192 $ 207 $ 536 $ 759\nDenominator for basic earnings per share—Weighted-\naverage shares outstanding 262.3 267.8 264.9 267.6\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nRestricted stock units (\"RSUs\") 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.5\nPerformance-based RSUs (\"PSUs\") 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.2\nDenominator for diluted earnings per share—Adjusted\nweighted-average shares outstanding 262.6 268.4 265.3 268.3\nBasic earnings per share from continuing operations $ 0.73 $ 0.77 $ 2.02 $ 2.84\nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations (1) $ 0.73 $ 0.77 $ 2.02 $ 2.83\n(1) Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was computed using the treasury stock method for dilutive\nsecurities.\nNote 11.

Supply Chain Financing\nWe utilize voluntary supply chain finance programs to support our efforts in negotiating payment term extensions with\nsuppliers as part of our effort to improve our operating cash flows. These programs provide participating suppliers the\nopportunity to sell their LKQ receivables to financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial\ninstitutions. We are not a party to the agreement between the suppliers and financial institutions. The financial institutions\nparticipate in the supply chain financing initiative on an uncommitted basis and can cease purchasing receivables from our\nsuppliers at any time. Our obligation to our suppliers, including amount due and payment date, are not impacted by the\nsupplier’s decision to sell amounts under these agreements. Our payment terms to the financial institutions, including the timing\nand amount of payments, are unchanged from the original supplier invoice. All outstanding payments owed under the supply\nchain finance programs with the participating financial institutions are recorded within Accounts payable on our Unaudited\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $451 million and\n$411 million of Accounts payable outstanding under the arrangements, respectively.\n17\nNote 13.

Borrowings under the agreement bear interest at the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") plus the applicable spread or other risk-free interest rates that are applicable for\nthe specified currency plus a spread based on the Company's debt rating and total leverage ratio. On June 5, 2024, we entered\ninto Amendment No. 1 to the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement which replaced the Canadian Dollar Offer Rate (\"CDOR\")\nwith the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (\"CORRA\") for CAD denominated borrowings.\nSenior Unsecured Term Loan Credit Agreement\nThe Senior Unsecured Term Loan Credit Agreement (\"CAD Note\") established an unsecured term loan facility of up to CAD\n700 million maturing in July 2026. On June 12, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the CAD Note which replaced\nCDOR with CORRA. The variable interest rate applicable to the CAD Note may be (i) a forward-looking term rate based on\nCORRA for an interest period chosen by the Company of one or three months or (ii) the Canadian Prime Rate (as defined in the\nCAD Note), plus in each case a spread based on the Company’s debt rating and total leverage ratio.\n18\nUnsecured Senior Notes\nOn March 13, 2024, LKQ, together with its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, LKQ Dutch Bond B.V., a private company with\nlimited liability, completed an offering and sale of €750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.125% Notes due March 13,\n2031 (“Euro Notes (2031)”).\nThe Euro Notes (2031) bear interest at a rate of 4.125% per year. Interest on the Euro Notes (2031) is payable annually on each\nMarch 13, commencing on March 13, 2025. The Euro Notes (2031) will be initially fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a\nsenior unsecured basis (the “Guarantees”) by the Company and each of its wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries that are guarantors\nunder our Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement and our CAD Note. The Euro Notes (2031) will also be guaranteed by each of\nthe Company’s U.S. subsidiaries that in the future agrees to guarantee the Company’s obligations under the Senior Unsecured\nCredit Agreement, the CAD Note, any other Credit Facility Debt or any Capital Markets Debt (both as defined in the\nCompany’s preliminary prospectus supplement filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024).\nPrior to December 13, 2030 (the \"Par Call Date\"), the Euro Notes (2031) are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time and\nfrom time to time, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three decimal places)\nequal to the greater of: (1)(a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest\nthereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming that the Euro Notes (2031) matured on the Par Call Date) on an annual\n(ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) basis at a rate equal to the Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined in the Indenture,\ndated March 13, 2024 (the \"Euro Notes (2031) Indenture\")) plus 30 basis points, less (b) interest accrued to the date of\nredemption; and (2) 100% of the principal amount of the Euro Notes (2031) to be redeemed; plus, in either case, accrued and\nunpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after the Par Call Date, we may redeem the Euro Notes\n(2031), in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of\nthe Euro Notes (2031) being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nThe Euro Notes (2031) and the Guarantees have been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933 under the\nRegistration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-277267) filed by the Company with the SEC on February 22, 2024, as\nsupplemented by the prospectus supplement filed by the Company with the SEC on March 1, 2024. In April 2024, the Euro\nNotes (2031) were approved for listing and registration on the Nasdaq.\nRelated to the offering and sale of the Euro Notes (2031) in March 2024, we incurred $7 million of fees, which were capitalized\nas an offset to Long-Term Obligations and are amortized over the term of the Euro Notes (2031).\nWe used the net proceeds from this offering to (i) pay outstanding indebtedness, including all of the outstanding €500 million\naggregate principal amount of the 3.875% senior notes due 2024 (the “Euro Notes (2024)”) issued by the Company’s indirect\nwholly-owned subsidiary, LKQ Italia Bondco di LKQ Italia Bondco GP S.r.l e C.S.A.P.A.

The Euro Notes (2031) are governed by the Euro Notes\n(2031) Indenture, dated as of March 13, 2024.\nInterest on the U.S. Notes (2028/33) is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning\non December 15, 2023. Interest on our 4.13% senior notes due April 2028 (the \"Euro Notes (2028)\") is payable in arrears on\nApril 1 and October 1 of each year.\nNote 14. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe are exposed to market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and\ncommodity prices. Under current policies, we may use derivatives to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on our debt\nand changing foreign exchange rates for certain foreign currency denominated transactions. We do not hold or issue derivatives\nfor trading purposes.\nDerivative Instruments Designated as Cash Flow Hedges\nIn February 2023, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on our variable\ninterest rate payments related to borrowings under our Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the interest rate\nswap agreements, we pay the fixed interest rate and receive a variable interest rate based on term SOFR that matches a\ncontractually specified rate under the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement. The agreements include a total $400 million notional\namount maturing in February 2025 with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 4.63% and a total $300 million notional\namount maturing in February 2026 with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 4.23%. Changes in the fair value of the\ninterest rate swaps are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to Interest expense when the hedged\n19\ninterest payments affect earnings. The activity related to the interest rate swaps is classified in operating activities in our\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the activity relates to normal recurring settlements to match\ninterest payments.\nIn March 2023, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge the risk of changes in interest rates related to\nforecasted debt issuance to finance a portion of the Uni-Select Acquisition. These swaps were settled in May 2023 upon\nissuance of the U.S. Notes (2028/33), resulting in total payments of $13 million. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate\nswaps were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and the fair value at the termination date is being reclassified to\nInterest expense over the term of the debt.\nAll of our interest rate swap contracts have been executed with counterparties that we believe are creditworthy, and we closely\nmonitor the credit ratings of these counterparties.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the notional amounts, balance sheet classification and fair values of our\nderivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNotional Fair Value -\nAmount Balance Sheet Caption Asset / (Liability)\nInterest rate swap agreements $ 400 Other accrued expenses $ —\nInterest rate swap agreements 300 Other noncurrent liabilities (3)\nDecember 31, 2023\nNotional Fair Value -\nAmount Balance Sheet Caption Asset / (Liability)\nInterest rate swap agreements $ 700 Other noncurrent liabilities $ (2)\nThe activity related to our cash flow hedges is included in Note 11, \"Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).\" As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we estimate that $2 million of derivative losses (net of tax) included in Accumulated other comprehensive\nloss will be reclassified into our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income within the next 12 months.\nDerivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedges\nTo manage the foreign currency exposure related to the Uni-Select Acquisition purchase price (denominated in CAD), we\nentered into foreign exchange contracts in March 2023 to purchase CAD 1.6 billion for approximately $1.2 billion. These\ncontracts did not qualify for hedge accounting, and therefore, the contracts were adjusted to fair value through the results of\noperations as of each balance sheet date. We reported Gains on foreign exchange contracts - acquisition related of $3 million\nand $49 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. These contracts were settled in July\n2023 resulting in total payments received of $49 million.\nTo manage our foreign currency exposure on other non-functional currency denominated intercompany loans, we enter into\nshort-term foreign currency forward contracts from time to time. We have not elected to apply hedge accounting for these\ntransactions, and therefore the contracts are adjusted to fair value through our results of operations as of each balance sheet\ndate. The effect on our results of operations for these contracts during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, were not material. The fair values of these short-term derivative instruments that remained outstanding as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 were recorded in either Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other accrued expenses on our\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and were not material at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nAdditionally, we hold other short-term derivative instruments, including foreign currency forward contracts, to manage our\nexposure to variability in the cash flows related to inventory purchases denominated in a non-functional currency. We have not\nelected to apply hedge accounting for these transactions. The notional amount and fair value of these contracts at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, along with the effect on our results of operations during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, were not material. The fair values of these contracts were recorded in either Prepaid expenses\nand other current assets or Other accrued expenses on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n20\nGross vs. Net Presentation for Derivative Instruments\nWhile certain derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are subject to master netting arrangements, we\npresent our cash flow hedge and other derivative instruments on a gross basis on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. The impact of netting the fair values of these contracts would result in an immaterial decrease to Prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets and Other accrued expenses on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nNote 15. Fair Value Measurements\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\nWe use the market and income approaches to estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and during the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in valuation techniques or inputs related to the\nfinancial assets or liabilities that we have historically recorded at fair value. The tiers in the fair value hierarchy include: Level\n1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted\nprices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as significant unobservable inputs\nfor which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe following table presents information about our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and\nindicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs we utilized to determine such fair value as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nInvestments - debt securities $ 37 $ — $ — $ 37 $ 22 $ — $ — $ 22\nInvestments - equity securities 9 — — 9 3 — — 3\nTotal Assets $ 46 $ — $ — $ 46 $ 25 $ — $ — $ 25\nLiabilities:\nInterest rate swaps $ — $ 3 $ — $ 3 $ — $ 2 $ — $ 2\nContingent consideration liabilities — — 3 3 — — 2 2\nTotal Liabilities $ — $ 3 $ 3 $ 6 $ — $ 2 $ 2 $ 4\nInvestments in debt and equity securities relate to our captive insurance subsidiary and are included in Other noncurrent assets\non the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The balance sheet classification of the interest rate swap agreements\nis presented in Note 14, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.\" For contingent consideration liabilities, the current\nportion is included in Other current liabilities and the noncurrent portion is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the expected timing of the related payments.\nWe value derivative instruments using a third party valuation model that performs discounted cash flow analysis based on the\nterms of the contracts and market observable inputs such as current and forward interest rates and current and forward foreign\nexchange rates.\nOur contingent consideration liabilities are related to our business acquisitions. Under the terms of the contingent consideration\nagreements, payments may be made at specified future dates depending on the performance of the acquired business subsequent\nto the acquisition. The liabilities for these payments are classified as Level 3 liabilities because the related fair value\nmeasurement, which is determined using an income approach, includes significant inputs not observable in the market.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value\nOur debt is reflected on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost. The fair value measurements of the\nborrowings under the credit agreement are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy since they are determined based\nupon significant inputs observable in the market, including interest rates on recent financing transactions with similar terms and\nmaturities. We estimated the fair value by calculating the upfront cash payment a market participant would require at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 to assume these obligations. The fair values of the U.S. Notes (2028), U.S. Notes\n21\n(2033), Euro Notes (2024), Euro Notes (2028) and Euro Notes (2031) are determined based upon observable market inputs\nincluding quoted market prices in markets that are not active, and therefore are classified as Level 2 within the fair value\nhierarchy.\nBased on market conditions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the borrowings under the\nSenior Unsecured Credit Agreement reasonably approximated the carrying values of $1,213 million and $1,414 million,\nrespectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the borrowings under the CAD Note\nreasonably approximated the carrying values of $518 million and $529 million, respectively.\nThe following table provides the carrying and fair value for our other financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 (in millions):\nAs of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nCarrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value\nU.S. Notes (2028) $ 800 $ 831 $ 800 $ 820\nU.S. Notes (2033) 600 636 600 628\nEuro Notes (2024) — — 552 552\nEuro Notes (2028) 278 279 276 276\nEuro Notes (2031) 835 848 — —\nNote 16. Employee Benefit Plans\nWe have funded and unfunded defined benefit plans covering certain employee groups in various European countries and\nCanada. Local statutory requirements govern many of our European and Canadian plans. The defined benefit plans are mostly\nclosed to new participants and, in some cases, existing participants no longer accrue benefits.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate funded status of the defined benefit plans was a net liability of\n$84 million and $83 million, respectively, and is reported in Other noncurrent assets, Other noncurrent liabilities and Accrued\npayroll-related liabilities on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNet periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit plans were not material for each of the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023. The service cost component is recorded in Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\")\nexpenses, while the other components are recorded to Interest income and other income, net on the Unaudited Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Income.\nNote 17. Income Taxes\nAt the end of each interim period, we estimate our annual effective tax rate and apply that rate to our interim earnings. We also\nrecord the tax impact of certain unusual or infrequently occurring items, including changes in judgment about valuation\nallowances and the effects of changes in tax laws or rates, in the interim period in which they occur.\nThe computation of the annual estimated effective tax rate at each interim period requires certain estimates and significant\njudgment including, but not limited to, the expected operating income for the year, projections of the proportion of income\nearned and taxed in state and foreign jurisdictions, permanent and temporary differences between book and taxable income, and\nthe likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets generated in the current year. The accounting estimates used to compute the\nprovision for income taxes may change as new events occur, additional information is obtained or as the tax environment\nchanges.\nOur effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 28.8%, compared to 25.9% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to a 2.9% year over year unfavorable impact of\ndiscrete items, mostly related to the unfavorable tax effects of the 2024 Global Restructuring Plan impairments in the current\nyear and the favorable tax effects from the Uni-Select Acquisition foreign exchange forward contract gain in the prior year.\nRefer to Note 9, \"Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses\" for further information on the impairments and Note 14,\n\"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" for further information on the foreign exchange forward contracts.\n22\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") released a framework, referred to as Pillar Two, to\nimplement a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% on certain multinational enterprises. Certain countries have enacted\nlegislation to adopt the Pillar Two framework while several countries are considering or still announcing changes to their tax\nlaws to implement the minimum tax directive. While we do not currently estimate Pillar Two to have a material impact on our\neffective tax rate, our analysis will continue as the OECD continues to release additional guidance and countries implement\nlegislation.\nNote 18. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nOur policy is to reclassify from Cash and cash equivalents any cash that is legally or contractually restricted as to withdrawal or\nusage. The following table provides a reconciliation of Cash and cash equivalents as reported in the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets to Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the unaudited condensed consolidated\nstatements of cash flows (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 353 $ 299\nRestricted cash included in Other noncurrent assets (1) 17 —\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 370 $ 299\n(1) Represents cash held with our captive insurance subsidiary for payments on self-insured claims.\nNote 19. Segment and Geographic Information\nWe have four operating segments: Wholesale - North America; Europe; Specialty; and Self Service, each of which is presented\nas a reportable segment.\nThe segments are organized based on a combination of geographic areas served and type of product lines offered. The segments\nare managed separately as the businesses serve different customers and are affected by different economic conditions.\nWholesale - North America and Self Service have similar economic characteristics and have common products and services,\ncustomers and methods of distribution. We are reporting these operating segments separately to provide greater transparency to\ninvestors.\nThe following tables present our financial performance by reportable segment for the periods indicated (in millions):\nWholesale\n- North Self\nAmerica Europe Specialty Service Eliminations Consolidated\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nRevenue:\nThird Party $ 1,423 $ 1,613 $ 417 $ 131 $ — $ 3,584\nIntersegment — — 2 — (2) —\nTotal segment revenue $ 1,423 $ 1,613 $ 419 $ 131 $ (2) $ 3,584\nSegment EBITDA $ 228 $ 165 $ 31 $ 10 $ — $ 434\nTotal depreciation and amortization (1) 49 39 8 4 — 100\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue:\nThird Party $ 1,387 $ 1,584 $ 456 $ 141 $ — $ 3,568\nIntersegment — — 1 — (1) —\nTotal segment revenue $ 1,387 $ 1,584 $ 457 $ 141 $ (1) $ 3,568\nSegment EBITDA $ 236 $ 147 $ 40 $ (1) $ — $ 422\nTotal depreciation and amortization (1) 34 37 8 5 — 84\n23\nWholesale\n- North Self\nAmerica Europe Specialty Service Eliminations Consolidated\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nRevenue:\nThird Party $ 4,396 $ 4,896 $ 1,305 $ 401 $ — $ 10,998\nIntersegment 1 — 3 — (4) —\nTotal segment revenue $ 4,397 $ 4,896 $ 1,308 $ 401 $ (4) $ 10,998\nSegment EBITDA $ 728 $ 482 $ 99 $ 39 $ — $ 1,348\nTotal depreciation and amortization (1) 146 118 25 11 — 300\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue:\nThird Party $ 3,815 $ 4,777 $ 1,294 $ 479 $ — $ 10,365\nIntersegment — — 3 — (3) —\nTotal segment revenue $ 3,815 $ 4,777 $ 1,297 $ 479 $ (3) $ 10,365\nSegment EBITDA $ 736 $ 486 $ 113 $ 28 $ — $ 1,363\nTotal depreciation and amortization (1) 73 110 24 12 — 219\n(1) Amounts presented include depreciation and amortization expense recorded within Cost of goods sold, SG&A expenses\nand Restructuring and transaction related expenses.\nThe key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our CODM, our Chief Executive Officer, is Segment EBITDA. We use\nSegment EBITDA to compare profitability among the segments and evaluate business strategies. Segment EBITDA includes\nrevenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. Corporate general and administrative expenses are allocated to the\nsegments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue. We\ncalculate Segment EBITDA as Net Income excluding net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interest; income and\nloss from discontinued operations; depreciation; amortization; interest; gains and losses on debt extinguishment; income tax\nexpense; restructuring and transaction related expenses; change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; other gains\nand losses related to acquisitions, equity method investments, or divestitures; equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated\nsubsidiaries; equity investment fair value adjustments; impairment charges; and direct impacts of the Ukraine/Russia conflict.\n24\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of Net Income to Segment EBITDA (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income $ 192 $ 208 $ 536 $ 760\nLess: net income attributable to continuing\nnoncontrolling interest 1 — 2 1\nNet income attributable to LKQ stockholders 191 208 534 759\nLess: net income from discontinued\noperations — 1 — 1\nNet income from continuing operations\nattributable to LKQ stockholders 191 207 534 758\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization 100 84 300 219\nInterest expense, net of interest income 62 53 185 128\nLoss on debt extinguishment — — — 1\nProvision for income taxes 63 60 216 263\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated\nsubsidiaries (1) (3) (4) (3) (9)\nGains on foreign exchange contracts -\nacquisition related (2) — (3) — (49)\nEquity investment fair value adjustments — — 2 1\nRestructuring and transaction related\nexpenses (3) 20 27 99 53\nRestructuring expenses - cost of goods sold (3) 1 2 15 2\nGains on previously held equity interests — (4) — (4)\nSegment EBITDA $ 434 $ 422 $ 1,348 $ 1,363\n(1) Refer to Note 7, \"Equity Method Investments\" for further information.\n(2) Refer to Note 2, \"Business Combinations\" and Note 14, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" for further\ninformation.\n(3) Refer to Note 9, \"Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses\" for further information.\nThe following table presents capital expenditures by reportable segment (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCapital Expenditures\nWholesale - North America $ 47 $ 39 $ 120 $ 75\nEurope 24 47 82 103\nSpecialty 7 5 16 23\nSelf Service 1 6 7 32\nTotal capital expenditures $ 79 $ 97 $ 225 $ 233\n25\nThe following table presents assets by reportable segment (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nReceivables, net of allowance for credit losses\nWholesale - North America $ 499 $ 470\nEurope 696 580\nSpecialty 136 107\nSelf Service 10 8\nTotal receivables, net of allowance for credit losses 1,341 1,165\nInventories\nWholesale - North America 1,280 1,217\nEurope 1,368 1,390\nSpecialty 449 475\nSelf Service 35 39\nTotal inventories 3,132 3,121\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\nWholesale - North America 707 644\nEurope 643 642\nSpecialty 117 118\nSelf Service 107 112\nTotal property, plant and equipment, net 1,574 1,516\nOperating lease assets, net\nWholesale - North America 625 615\nEurope 497 494\nSpecialty 126 84\nSelf Service 133 143\nTotal operating lease assets, net 1,381 1,336\nOther unallocated assets 8,038 7,941\nTotal assets $ 15,466 $ 15,079\nWe report net receivables; inventories; net property, plant and equipment; and net operating lease assets by segment as that\ninformation is used by the CODM in assessing segment performance.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements and information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical are forward-looking statements within\nthe meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are made pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of\nsuch Act.\nForward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our outlook, guidance, expectations, beliefs,\nhopes, intentions and strategies. Words such as “may,” “will,” “plan,” “should,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “if,”\n“estimate,” “intend,” “project” and similar words or expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These\nstatements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause our actual results,\nperformance or achievements to be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to us\nat the time the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result\nof new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nYou should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual events or results may differ materially from\nthose expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. The risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could\ncause actual results to differ from the results predicted or implied by our forward-looking statements include factors discussed\nin our filings with the SEC, including those disclosed under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2023 Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q\n(including this Quarterly Report).\nOverview\nLKQ, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index, is a global distributor of vehicle products, including replacement\nparts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and specialty aftermarket products and\naccessories to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles.\nBuyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources: new products produced by\nOEMs; new products produced by companies other than the OEMs, which are referred to as aftermarket products; recycled\nproducts obtained from salvage and total loss vehicles; recycled products that have been refurbished; and recycled products that\nhave been remanufactured. We distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops, including aftermarket\ncollision and mechanical products; recycled collision and mechanical products; refurbished collision products such as wheels,\nbumper covers and lights; and remanufactured engines and transmissions. Collectively, we refer to the four sources that are not\nnew OEM products as alternative parts.\nWe are organized into four operating segments: Wholesale - North America; Europe; Specialty; and Self Service, each of which\nis presented as a reportable segment.\nOur Wholesale - North America segment is a leading provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products, paint and\nrelated body repair products, and alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products, with our sales, processing, and\ndistribution facilities reaching most major markets in the United States and Canada. Our Europe segment is a leading provider\nof alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in Germany, the U.K., the Benelux region (Belgium, Netherlands,\nand Luxembourg), Italy, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia, and various other European countries. Our Specialty segment is a\nleading distributor of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories reaching most major markets in the U.S. and\nCanada. Our Self Service segment operates self service retail facilities across the U.S. that sell recycled automotive products\nfrom end-of-life-vehicles.\nOur operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in\nthe future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Please refer to the factors referred to in\nForward-Looking Statements above. Due to these factors and others, which may be unknown to us at this time, our operating\nresults in future periods can be expected to fluctuate. Accordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of\nfuture performance.\n27\nAcquisitions and Investments\nSince our inception in 1998, we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. Our current\nacquisition strategy focuses on highly accretive tuck-in acquisitions with significant synergies or critical capabilities and no\nlarge platform acquisitions are expected. Additionally, from time to time, we make investments in various businesses to\nadvance our strategic objectives. See Note 2, \"Business Combinations,\" and Note 7, \"Equity Method Investments,\" to\nthe Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for\nadditional information related to our acquisitions and investments.\nSources of Revenue\nWe report our revenue in two categories: (i) parts and services and (ii) other. Our parts revenue is generated from the sale of\nvehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and\nspecialty products and accessories used to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles. Our service\nrevenue is generated primarily from the sale of service-type warranties, fees for admission to our self service yards, and\ndiagnostic and repair services. Revenue from other sources includes sales of scrap and other metals (including precious metals -\nplatinum, palladium and rhodium - contained in recycled parts such as catalytic converters), bulk sales to mechanical\nmanufacturers (including cores) and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from our furnace operations. Other revenue will vary\nfrom period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold. See Note 8, \"Revenue\nRecognition\" to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q for additional information related to our sources of revenue.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Unaudited Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial\nstatements requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our 2023 Form 10-K includes a\nsummary of the critical accounting estimates we believe are the most important to aid in understanding our financial results.\nThere have been no changes to those critical accounting estimates that have had a material impact on our reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenues or expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" in Note 1, \"Interim Financial Statements\" to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information related to new accounting\nstandards.\nFinancial Information by Geographic Area\nSee Note 8, \"Revenue Recognition\" and Note 19, \"Segment and Geographic Information\" to the Unaudited Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information related to our\nrevenue and long-lived assets by geographic region.\n1 LKQ Europe Plan\nWe have undertaken the 1 LKQ Europe plan to create structural centralization and standardization of key functions to facilitate\nthe operation of the Europe segment as a single business. Under this multi-year plan, we expect to recognize the following:\n• Restructuring expenses — Non-recurring costs resulting directly from the implementation of the 1 LKQ Europe plan from\nwhich the business will derive no ongoing benefit. See Note 9, \"Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses” to the\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for\nfurther details.\n• Transformation expenses — Period costs incurred to execute the 1 LKQ Europe plan that are expected to contribute to\nongoing benefits to the business (e.g., non-capitalizable implementation costs related to a common ERP platform). These\nexpenses are recorded in SG&A expenses.\n28\n• Transformation capital expenditures — Capitalizable costs for long-lived assets, such as software and facilities, that\ndirectly relate to the execution of the 1 LKQ Europe plan.\nCosts related to the 1 LKQ Europe plan are reflected in SG&A expenses, Restructuring and transaction related expenses and\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe are executing on the various projects associated with the 1 LKQ Europe plan and expect to be completed by the end of\n2027. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $12 million and $31 million, respectively, in\ncosts across all three categories noted above. We expect that costs of the plan, reflecting all three categories noted above, will\nrange between $125 million to $155 million for 2024 through the projected plan completion date in 2027. In the future, we may\nalso identify additional initiatives and projects under the 1 LKQ Europe plan that may result in additional expenditures,\nalthough we are currently unable to estimate the range of charges for such potential future initiatives and projects. We expect\nthe plan to continue to enable trade working capital and productivity initiatives that will help fund the plan cost.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe believe that organic revenue growth, Segment EBITDA and free cash flow are key performance indicators for our business.\nSegment EBITDA is our key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our CODM. Free cash flow is a financial measure\nthat is not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP”).\n• Organic revenue growth - We define organic revenue growth as total revenue growth from continuing operations excluding\nthe effects of acquisitions and divestitures (i.e., revenue generated from the date of acquisition to the first anniversary of\nthat acquisition, net of reduced revenue due to the disposal of businesses) and foreign currency movements (i.e., impact of\ntranslating revenue at different exchange rates). Organic revenue growth includes incremental sales from both existing and\nnew (i.e., opened within the last twelve months) locations and is derived from expanding business with existing customers,\nsecuring new customers and offering additional products and services. We believe that organic revenue growth is a key\nperformance indicator as this statistic measures our ability to serve and grow our customer base successfully.\n• Segment EBITDA - See Note 19, \"Segment and Geographic Information\" to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of the calculation of\nSegment EBITDA. We believe that Segment EBITDA provides useful information to evaluate our segment profitability by\nfocusing on the indicators of ongoing operational results.\n• Free Cash Flow - We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property, plant\nand equipment. Free cash flow provides insight into our liquidity and provides useful information to management and\ninvestors concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements, make\nstrategic acquisitions, repurchase stock, and pay dividends.\nThese three key performance indicators are used as targets in determining incentive compensation at various levels of the\norganization, including senior management. By using these performance measures, we attempt to motivate a balanced approach\nto the business that rewards growth, profitability and cash flow generation in a manner that enhances our long-term prospects.\n29\nResults of Operations—Consolidated\nThe following table sets forth statements of income data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCost of goods sold 61.2 % 61.0 % 61.0 % 59.7 %\nGross margin 38.8 % 39.0 % 39.0 % 40.3 %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 27.1 % 27.5 % 27.2 % 27.5 %\nRestructuring and transaction related expenses 0.6 % 0.8 % 0.9 % 0.5 %\nDepreciation and amortization 2.5 % 2.1 % 2.4 % 1.9 %\nOperating income 8.6 % 8.6 % 8.4 % 10.4 %\nTotal other expense, net 1.6 % 1.3 % 1.6 % 0.6 %\nIncome from continuing operations before\nprovision for income taxes 7.0 % 7.4 % 6.8 % 9.8 %\nProvision for income taxes 1.7 % 1.7 % 2.0 % 2.5 %\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated\nsubsidiaries 0.1 % 0.1 % — % 0.1 %\nIncome from continuing operations 5.3 % 5.8 % 4.9 % 7.3 %\nNet income from discontinued operations — % — % — % — %\nNet income 5.3 % 5.9 % 4.9 % 7.3 %\nLess: net income attributable to continuing\nnoncontrolling interest — % — % — % — %\nNet income attributable to LKQ stockholders 5.3 % 5.8 % 4.9 % 7.3 %\nNote: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in revenue by category (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Percentage Change in Revenue\nAcquisition and Foreign Total\n2024 2023 Organic Divestiture Exchange Change\nParts & services revenue $ 3,427 $ 3,407 (2.8) % 3.1 % 0.4 % 0.6 %\nOther revenue 157 161 (2.4) % 0.1 % — % (2.2) %\nTotal revenue $ 3,584 $ 3,568 (2.8) % 2.9 % 0.3 % 0.5 %\nNote: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\nThe increase in parts and services revenue of 0.6% represented increases in segment revenue of 2.8% in Wholesale - North\nAmerica and 1.8% in Europe, partially offset by decreases of 10.5% in Self Service and 8.5% in Specialty. This overall increase\nwas driven by a 3.1% increase due to the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and a 0.4% increase due to fluctuations in\nforeign exchange rates, partially offset by an organic parts and services revenue decrease of 2.8% (4.3% decrease on a per day\nbasis). The decrease in other revenue of 2.2% was primarily driven by a decrease in organic revenue of $4 million due to lower\ncommodities prices and volumes compared to the prior year period, which resulted in a $4 million decrease in Self Service and\na $2 million decrease in Wholesale - North America. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors\ncontributing to the changes in revenue by segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\n30\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased to 61.2% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nfrom 61.0% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of goods sold reflects an increase of 0.7% from\nWholesale - North America, partially offset by decreases of 0.3% from Self Service and 0.2% from Europe.

The year over year decrease in SG&A expense primarily reflects impacts of 0.4%\nrelated to Wholesale - North America and 0.3% in Europe, partially offset by an increase of 0.2% from Specialty. Refer to the\ndiscussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in SG&A expenses as a percentage of\nrevenue by segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nRestructuring and Transaction Related Expenses\nThe following table summarizes restructuring and transaction related expenses for the periods indicated (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\nRestructuring expenses $ 19 (1) $ 24 (2) $ (5)\nTransaction related expenses 1 3 (2)\nRestructuring and transaction related expenses $ 20 $ 27 $ (7)\n(1) Restructuring expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of (i) $14 million related to\nour 2024 Global Restructuring plan, (ii) $4 million related to our acquisition integration plans, and (iii) $1 million related\nto our 2022 Global Restructuring plan.\n(2) Restructuring expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of $20 million related to our\nacquisition integration plans and $4 million related to our 2022 Global Restructuring plan.\nSee Note 9, \"Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses\" to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on our restructuring and acquisition integration\nplans.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe following table summarizes depreciation and amortization for the periods indicated (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\nDepreciation $ 45 $ 40 $ 5 (1)\nAmortization 47 36 11 (2)\nDepreciation and amortization $ 92 $ 76 $ 16\n(1) Depreciation expense increased primarily related to increased capital expenditures in the last three months of 2023 and\nacquisitions in our Wholesale - North America and Europe segments.\n(2) Amortization expense increased primarily due to an increase in Wholesale - North America due to our acquisition of Uni-\nSelect in August 2023.\n31\nTotal Other Expense, Net\nThe following table summarizes Total other expense, net for the periods indicated (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\nInterest expense $ 66 $ 62 $ 4 (1)\nGains on foreign exchange contracts - acquisition related — (3) 3 (2)\nInterest income and other income, net (8) (14) 6 (3)\nTotal other expense, net $ 58 $ 45 $ 13\n(1) Interest expense increased primarily due to a $4 million increase from higher outstanding debt in the current year period.\n(2) Related to the Uni-Select Acquisition. See Note 2, \"Business Combinations\" and Note 14, \"Derivative Instruments and\nHedging Activities\" to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q for further information.\n(3) The decrease in Interest income and other income, net is primarily comprised of a $5 million decrease in interest income,\nprimarily related to interest income on the proceeds from the U.S. Notes (2028/33) that were invested in money market\nfunds in 2023 and individually insignificant decreases which in the aggregate had a $1 million impact.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 25.0%, compared to 22.6% for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is mostly related to favorable discrete items in the prior year of 4.4%,\nprimarily related to the Uni-Select Acquisition foreign exchange forward contract gain, exceeding the favorable discrete items\nof 2.4% in the current year. Refer to Note 14, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" for further information on the\nforeign exchange forward contracts.\nSee Note 17, \"Income Taxes\" to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q for further information.\nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $1 million\nprimarily related to a decrease in year over year results in an immaterial investment in our Europe segment.\nForeign Currency Impact\nWe translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period. Relative to the rates used during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023, the Czech koruna and Canadian dollar rates used to translate the 2024 statements\nof income decreased by 3.3% and 1.7%, respectively, while the pound sterling and euro rates increased by 2.7% and 1.0%,\nrespectively. Realized and unrealized currency gains and losses (including the effects of hedge instruments) combined with the\ntranslation effect of the change in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar had a net negative effect of $0.06 on diluted\nearnings per share relative to the prior year period primarily related to the gain on the foreign exchange forward contracts in the\nthird quarter of 2023 related to the Uni-Select Acquisition, including the tax effects.\n32\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in revenue by category (in millions):\nNine Months Ended September 30, Percentage Change in Revenue\nAcquisition and Foreign Total\n2024 2023 Organic Divestiture Exchange Change\nParts & services revenue $ 10,514 $ 9,818 (1.8) % 8.7 % 0.2 % 7.1 %\nOther revenue 484 547 (11.8) % 0.3 % — % (11.5) %\nTotal revenue $ 10,998 $ 10,365 (2.3) % 8.2 % 0.2 % 6.1 %\nNote: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\nThe increase in parts and services revenue of 7.1% represented increases in segment revenue of 16.4% in Wholesale - North\nAmerica, 2.4% in Europe, and 0.8% in Specialty, partially offset by a decrease of 10.7% in Self Service. This overall increase\nwas driven by an 8.7% increase due to the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and a 0.2% increase due to fluctuations in\nforeign exchange rates, partially offset by an organic parts and services revenue decrease of 1.8%. The decrease in other\nrevenue of 11.5% was primarily driven by a decrease in organic revenue of $65 million due to lower commodities prices and\nvolumes compared to the prior year period, which resulted in a $58 million decrease in Self Service and a $9 million decrease in\nWholesale - North America. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes\nin revenue by segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased to 61.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 59.7%\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

See Note 2, \"Business Combinations\" and Note 14, \"Derivative Instruments and\nHedging Activities\" to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q for further information.\n(3) The decrease in Interest income and other income, net is primarily comprised of (i) an $11 million decrease in interest\nincome, primarily related to interest income on the proceeds from the U.S. Notes (2028/33) that were invested in money\nmarket funds in 2023, (ii) a $5 million decrease from funds received to settle an eminent domain matter in 2023, and (iii)\nindividually insignificant decreases which in the aggregate had a $1 million impact.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 28.8%, compared to 25.9% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to a 2.9% year over year unfavorable impact of\ndiscrete items, mostly related to the unfavorable tax effects of the 2024 Global Restructuring Plan impairments in the current\nyear and the favorable tax effects from the Uni-Select Acquisition foreign exchange forward contract gain in the prior year.\nRefer to Note 9, \"Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses\" for further information on the impairments and Note 14,\n\"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" for further information on the foreign exchange forward contracts.\n34\nSee Note 17, \"Income Taxes\" to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q for further information.\nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $6 million\ncompared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to a decrease in year over year results reported by\nMekonomen, which is our largest equity method investment.\nForeign Currency Impact\nWe translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period. Relative to the rates used during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Czech koruna and Canadian dollar rates used to translate the 2024 statements of\nincome decreased by 4.6% and 1.1%, respectively, while the pound sterling and euro rates increased by 2.6% and 0.4%,\nrespectively. Realized and unrealized currency gains and losses (including the effects of hedge instruments) combined with the\ntranslation effect of the change in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar had a net negative effect of $0.19 on diluted\nearnings per share relative to the prior year period primarily related to the $49 million pretax gain on the foreign exchange\nforward contracts in the first nine months of 2023 related to the Uni-Select Acquisition.\nResults of Operations—Segment Reporting\nWe have four reportable segments: Wholesale - North America; Europe; Specialty; and Self Service.\nWe have presented the growth of our revenue and profitability in our operations on both an as reported and a constant currency\nbasis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information\nregarding our growth and profitability, consistent with how we evaluate our performance, as this statistic removes the\ntranslation impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational\nperformance. Constant currency revenue and Segment EBITDA results are calculated by translating prior year revenue and\nSegment EBITDA in local currency using the current year's currency conversion rate. This non-GAAP financial measure has\nimportant limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our\nresults as reported under GAAP. Our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by other issuers due to\npotential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. In addition, not all\ncompanies that report revenue or profitability on a constant currency basis calculate such measures in the same manner as we\ndo, and accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other companies and may\nnot be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.\n35\nThe following table presents our financial performance, including third party revenue, total revenue and Segment EBITDA, by\nreportable segment for the periods indicated (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n% of % of % of % of\nTotal Total Total Total\nSegment Segment Segment Segment\n2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue 2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue\nThird Party Revenue\nWholesale - North America $ 1,423 $ 1,387 $ 4,396 $ 3,815\nEurope 1,613 1,584 4,896 4,777\nSpecialty 417 456 1,305 1,294\nSelf Service 131 141 401 479\nTotal third party revenue $ 3,584 $ 3,568 $ 10,998 $ 10,365\nTotal Revenue\nWholesale - North America $ 1,423 $ 1,387 $ 4,397 $ 3,815\nEurope 1,613 1,584 4,896 4,777\nSpecialty 419 457 1,308 1,297\nSelf Service 131 141 401 479\nEliminations (2) (1) (4) (3)\nTotal revenue $ 3,584 $ 3,568 $ 10,998 $ 10,365\nSegment EBITDA\nWholesale - North America $ 228 16.1 % $ 236 17.0 % $ 728 16.6 % $ 736 19.3 %\nEurope 165 10.2 % 147 9.3 % 482 9.8 % 486 10.2 %\nSpecialty 31 7.3 % 40 8.6 % 99 7.6 % 113 8.7 %\nSelf Service 10 7.3 % (1) (0.6) % 39 9.7 % 28 6.0 %\nNote: In the table above, the percentages of total segment revenue may not recalculate due to rounding.\nThe key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our CODM, our Chief Executive Officer, is Segment EBITDA. We use\nSegment EBITDA to compare profitability among the segments and evaluate business strategies. Segment EBITDA includes\nrevenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. Corporate general and administrative expenses are allocated to the\nsegments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue. We\ncalculate Segment EBITDA as Net Income excluding net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interest; income and\nloss from discontinued operations; depreciation; amortization; interest; gains and losses on debt extinguishment; income tax\nexpense; restructuring and transaction related expenses; change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; other gains\nand losses related to acquisitions, equity method investments, or divestitures; equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated\nsubsidiaries; equity investment fair value adjustments; impairment charges; and direct impacts of the Ukraine/Russia conflict.\nSee Note 19, \"Segment and Geographic Information\" to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I,\nItem 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a reconciliation of total Segment EBITDA to net income.\n36\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nWholesale - North America\nThird Party Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our Wholesale - North America segment (in\nmillions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Percentage Change in Revenue\nWholesale - North Acquisition Foreign Total\nAmerica 2024 2023 Organic and Divestiture Exchange Change\nParts & services revenue $ 1,349 $ 1,312 (6.1) % (1) 9.1 % (3) (0.2) % 2.8 %\nOther revenue 74 75 (2.4) % (2) 0.3 % (0.1) % (2.2) %\nTotal third party revenue $ 1,423 $ 1,387 (5.9) % 8.6 % (0.1) % 2.5 %\nNote: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\n(1) Parts and services organic revenue decreased 6.1% (7.5% on a per day basis) for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the prior year period. This decline was primarily driven by a reduction in paint revenue, related to\nincreased competition, and a decrease in aftermarket collision volumes. The latter was negatively impacted by fewer\nrepairable claims, which we believe are mostly attributable to difficult economic conditions and, to a lesser extent,\ninventory availability issues due to delays in inbound deliveries. Additionally, adverse weather conditions caused by\nhurricane Helene led to temporary operational closures in the southeast region, which had a small but negative impact on\nrevenue towards the end of September 2024.\n(2) Other organic revenue decreased 2.4%, or $2 million, year over year primarily related to a $2 million decrease in revenue\nfrom precious metals due to lower prices and lower volumes.\n(3) Acquisition and divestiture parts and services revenue was an increase of $119 million, or 9.1%, primarily due to the\nacquisition of Uni-Select in the third quarter of 2023. See Note 2, \"Business Combinations\" to the Unaudited Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on the\nacquisition of Uni-Select.\nSegment EBITDA\nSegment EBITDA decreased $8 million, or 2.9%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year\nperiod, primarily due to the organic revenue decline, continued inflationary pressures, unfavorable commodities prices and a\ndecrease in salvage margins, partially offset by cost savings initiatives, acquisition related synergies, lower incentive\ncompensation for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and positive impacts from the acquisition of Uni-Select in the\nthird quarter of 2023 (Uni-Select increases Segment EBITDA dollars but dilutes the Segment EBITDA percentage). We\nestimate that precious metals and scrap steel prices had a net unfavorable effect of $4 million, or 0.3%, on Segment EBITDA\nmargin relative to the comparable prior year period.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in our Wholesale - North America\nsegment:\nPercentage of Total\nWholesale - North America Segment Revenue\nSegment EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2023 17.0 %\nIncrease (decrease) due to:\nChange in gross margin (1.8) % (1)\nChange in segment operating expenses 0.9 % (2)\nSegment EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 16.1 %\nNote: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\n(1) The decrease in gross margin of 1.8% was driven by decreases in salvage margins tied to softening salvage revenue, a\ndecline in commodities prices and the related mix effect resulting from lower aftermarket revenue, which has a higher\nmargin than our other wholesale lines. Additionally, gross margin was negatively affected by the dilutive nature of the\nacquisition of Uni-Select, which changed the segment's product mix to reflect a greater percentage of paint, body and\nequipment and maintenance product lines. These product lines have a lower gross margin structure than our other\n37\nwholesale product lines. The year over year effect was noted through the third quarter, and the impact has now been\nannualized.\n(2) The decrease in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue primarily reflects favorable impacts of (i) 0.8%\nrelated to lower incentive compensation and (ii) 0.3% in other personnel costs primarily related to higher operating\nleverage, partially offset by (iii) other individually immaterial factors representing a 0.2% unfavorable impact in the\naggregate.\nEurope\nThird Party Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our Europe segment (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Percentage Change in Revenue\nAcquisition and Foreign Total\nEurope 2024 2023 Organic Divestiture (2) Exchange (3) Change\nParts & services revenue $ 1,609 $ 1,581 1.8 % (1) (1.0) % 0.9 % 1.8 %\nOther revenue 4 3 33.2 % (0.5) % 2.9 % 35.6 %\nTotal third party revenue $ 1,613 $ 1,584 1.9 % (1.0) % 0.9 % 1.9 %\nNote: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\n(1) Parts and services organic revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.8% (0.1% on a per day\nbasis), primarily driven by an increased number of selling days in the current quarter compared to the prior year period.\nOn a per day basis, organic revenue was roughly flat as the effects of pricing initiatives to offset increased costs resulting\nfrom inflationary pressures were mostly offset by decreased overall volumes, despite increases in several markets, as a\nresult of difficult economic conditions and heightened competition in certain markets.\n(2) Acquisition and divestiture revenue was a net decrease of $16 million, or 1.0%, primarily related to our divestment of\nthree wholesale businesses in 2024.\n(3) Exchange rates increased our revenue growth by $15 million, or 0.9%, primarily due to the weaker U.S. dollar against the\npound sterling and euro, partially offset by the stronger U.S. dollar against the Czech koruna for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 relative to the prior year period.\nSegment EBITDA\nSegment EBITDA increased $18 million, or 12.1%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year\nperiod. On a constant currency basis (i.e., excluding translation impact), Segment EBITDA increased by $17 million, or 11.2%,\ncompared to the prior year period. The increase in dollar terms is mainly attributable to organic revenue growth of $30 million\nand a decrease in segment operating expenses largely driven by an $11 million charge in the prior year to settle a value-added\ntax issue in Italy.

The\nincrease is driven by improved vehicle procurement costs, operational productivity initiatives and more favorable movements in\nscrap steel prices, partially offset by lower volumes compared to the prior year period. During the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, scrap steel prices had a $1 million unfavorable impact on Segment EBITDA, compared to a $6 million\nunfavorable impact during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The unfavorable impacts for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 resulted from the decrease in scrap steel prices between the date we purchased a vehicle, which influences\nthe price we pay for a vehicle, and the date we scrapped a vehicle, which influences the price we receive for scrapping a\nvehicle.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in our Self Service segment:\nPercentage of Total\nSelf Service Segment Revenue\nSegment EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (0.6) %\nIncrease (decrease) due to:\nChange in gross margin 8.3 % (1)\nChange in segment operating expenses (0.4) % (2)\nSegment EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 7.3 %\nNote: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\n(1) The increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to improvements in vehicle procurement costs and improved\ncommodities prices.\n(2) The increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects negative leverage effect of 0.8% from\ndecreases in metals revenue, partially offset by other individually immaterial factors representing a 0.4% favorable impact\nin the aggregate.\n40\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nWholesale - North America\nThird Party Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our Wholesale - North America segment (in\nmillions):\nNine Months Ended September 30, Percentage Change in Revenue\nWholesale - North Acquisition Foreign Total\nAmerica 2024 2023 Organic and Divestiture Exchange Change\nParts & services revenue $ 4,169 $ 3,581 (5.0) % (1) 21.5 % (3) (0.1) % 16.4 %\nOther revenue 227 234 (3.8) % (2) 0.6 % (0.1) % (3.2) %\nTotal third party revenue $ 4,396 $ 3,815 (4.9) % 20.2 % (0.1) % 15.2 %\nNote: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\n(1) Parts and services organic revenue decreased 5.0% (5.4% on a per day basis) for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the prior year period. This decline was primarily driven by a reduction in aftermarket collision\nvolumes, which were negatively impacted by a reduction in repairable claims. We believe this is mainly attributable to\ndifficult economic conditions. Additionally, organic revenue was negatively impacted by a reduction in paint revenue\nrelated to increased competition, comparatively warmer weather in the first quarter of 2024 which reduced backlog at\nbody shops going into the second quarter of 2024 and, to a lesser extent, inventory availability issues due to delays in\ninbound deliveries.\n(2) Other organic revenue decreased 3.8%, or $9 million, year over year primarily related to (i) a $16 million decrease in\nrevenue from precious metals due to lower prices and (ii) a $1 million decrease in revenue from scrap steel due to lower\nprices, partially offset by (iii) an $8 million increase in revenue from other scrap (e.g., aluminum) and cores due to higher\nprices and higher volumes.\n(3) Acquisition and divestiture parts and services revenue was an increase of $769 million, or 21.5%, primarily due to the\nacquisition of Uni-Select in the third quarter of 2023. See Note 2, \"Business Combinations\" to the Unaudited Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information on the\nacquisition of Uni-Select.\nSegment EBITDA\nSegment EBITDA decreased $8 million, or 1.0%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year\nperiod, primarily due to lower aftermarket volumes, continued inflationary pressures, lower precious metals pricing and a\ndecrease in salvage margins, partially offset by positive impacts from the acquisition of Uni-Select in the third quarter of 2023\n(Uni-Select increases Segment EBITDA dollars but dilutes the Segment EBITDA percentage), cost savings initiatives,\nacquisition related synergies, and lower incentive compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We estimate\nthat precious metals and scrap steel prices had a net unfavorable effect of $17 million, or 0.4%, on Segment EBITDA margin\nrelative to the comparable prior year period.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in our Wholesale - North America\nsegment:\nPercentage of Total\nWholesale - North America Segment Revenue\nSegment EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 19.3 %\nIncrease (decrease) due to:\nChange in gross margin (4.1) % (1)\nChange in segment operating expenses 1.6 % (2)\nChange in other income and expenses, net (0.2) % (3)\nSegment EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 16.6 %\nNote: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\n41\n(1) The decrease in gross margin of 4.1% was driven by the dilutive nature of the acquisition of Uni-Select, which changed\nthe segment's product mix to reflect a greater percentage of paint, body and equipment and maintenance product lines.\nThese product lines have a lower gross margin structure than our other wholesale product lines. The year over year effect\nwas noted through the third quarter, and the impact now has been annualized. Additionally, gross margin was negatively\naffected by the related mix effect resulting from lower aftermarket revenue, which has a higher margin than our other\nwholesale lines as well as decreases in salvage margins tied to softening salvage revenue and a decline in commodities\nprices.\n(2) The decrease in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue primarily reflects favorable impacts of (i) 0.7%\nfrom lower incentive compensation, (ii) 0.3% from decreased freight, vehicle, and fuel costs, (iii) 0.2% from higher\ncharitable contributions in the prior year period and (iv) other individually immaterial factors representing a 0.4%\nfavorable impact in the aggregate.\n(3) The unfavorable impact in other income and expenses, net was primarily related to funds received to settle an eminent\ndomain matter in 2023.\nEurope\nThird Party Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our Europe segment (in millions):\nNine Months Ended September 30, Percentage Change in Revenue\nAcquisition and Foreign Total\nEurope 2024 2023 Organic Divestiture (2) Exchange (3) Change\nParts & services revenue $ 4,879 $ 4,762 1.6 % (1) 0.4 % 0.5 % 2.4 %\nOther revenue 17 15 15.0 % (0.1) % 0.9 % 15.9 %\nTotal third party revenue $ 4,896 $ 4,777 1.6 % 0.4 % 0.5 % 2.5 %\nNote: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\n(1) Parts and services organic revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.6% (1.0% on a per day\nbasis), primarily driven by increased volumes in the first quarter of 2024 and, to a lesser extent, pricing initiatives to offset\nincreased costs resulting from inflationary pressures.\n(2) Acquisition and divestiture revenue was a net increase of $18 million, or 0.4%, primarily related to our acquisition of six\nwholesale businesses from the beginning of 2023 through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition dates, partially offset\nby our divestment of three wholesale businesses in 2024.\n(3) Exchange rates increased our revenue growth by $23 million, or 0.5%, primarily due to the weaker U.S. dollar against the\npound sterling and euro, partially offset by the stronger U.S. dollar against the Czech koruna for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 relative to the prior year period.\nSegment EBITDA\nSegment EBITDA decreased $4 million, or 0.9%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year\nperiod. On a constant currency basis (i.e., excluding translation impact), Segment EBITDA decreased by $6 million, or 1.3%,\ncompared to the prior year period. The decrease in dollar terms is mainly attributable to lower gross margin and the negative\nimpact of higher operating expenses that more than offset the effects of organic revenue growth of $78 million. Refer to the\nForeign Currency Impact discussion within the Results of Operations–Consolidated section above for further detail regarding\nforeign currency impact on our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n42\nThe following table summarizes the changes in Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in our Europe segment:\nPercentage of Total\nEurope Segment Revenue\nSegment EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 10.2 %\nIncrease (decrease) due to:\nChange in gross margin (0.5) % (1)\nSegment EBITDA adjustments 0.3 % (1)\nChange in segment operating expenses (0.2) % (2)\nSegment EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 9.8 %\nNote: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\n(1) The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to unfavorable customer mix and inflationary pressures that were\nnot fully offset by pricing initiatives. Additionally, reported gross margin includes a 0.3% reduction primarily related to\nrestructuring expenses incurred as part of the 2024 Global Restructuring Plan. These costs are excluded from the\ncalculation of Segment EBITDA. See Note 9, \"Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses\" and Note 19, \"Segment\nand Geographic Information\" for further information.\n(2) The increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects unfavorable impacts of (i) 0.2% from\nincreased personnel costs mainly due wage inflation, (ii) 0.2% from increased outbound freight and logistics costs, (iii)\n0.2% from professional fees related to several strategic central and regional information technology initiatives, and (iv)\nother individually immaterial factors representing a 0.1% unfavorable impact in aggregate, partially offset by favorable\nimpacts of (v) 0.3% due to lower energy and utilities costs compared to the prior year period across all geographies, and\n(vi) 0.2% due to the settlement of a value-added tax issue in Italy in the prior year.\nSpecialty\nThird Party Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our Specialty segment (in millions):\nNine Months Ended September 30, Percentage Change in Revenue\nAcquisition and Foreign Total\nSpecialty 2024 2023 Organic (1) Divestiture (2) Exchange Change\nParts & services revenue $ 1,305 $ 1,294 (4.1) % 5.1 % (0.1) % 0.8 %\nOther revenue — — — % — % — % — %\nTotal third party revenue $ 1,305 $ 1,294 (4.1) % 5.1 % (0.1) % 0.8 %\nNote: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\n(1) Parts and services organic revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 4.1% (4.6% on a per day\nbasis) primarily due to demand softness in the RV and automotive product lines, as unit retail sales for RV and certain\nautomotive categories have declined year over year.\n(2) Acquisition and divestiture revenue was a net increase of $66 million, or 5.1%, primarily related to our acquisition of one\nSpecialty business in 2023.\nSegment EBITDA\nSegment EBITDA decreased $14 million, or 12.4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year\nperiod primarily due to the organic revenue decline and the decline in gross margin as explained below.\n43\nThe following table summarizes the changes in Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in our Specialty segment:\nPercentage of Total\nSpecialty Segment Revenue\nSegment EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 8.7 %\nIncrease (decrease) due to:\nChange in gross margin (0.6) % (1)\nChange in segment operating expenses (0.5) % (2)\nSegment EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 7.6 %\nNote: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\n(1) The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by higher discounts to help maintain sales volume in the first six\nmonths of the year.\n(2) The increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to unfavorable impacts of 0.3%\nrelated to higher credit loss reserves compared to the prior year and 0.2% due to duplicate facility costs associated with\nconsolidating distribution centers.\nSelf Service\nThird Party Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our Self Service segment (in millions):\nNine Months Ended September 30, Percentage Change in Revenue\nAcquisition and Foreign Total\nSelf Service 2024 2023 Organic Divestiture Exchange Change\nParts & services revenue $ 161 $ 181 (10.7) % (1) — % — % (10.7) %\nOther revenue 240 298 (19.5) % (2) — % — % (19.5) %\nTotal third party revenue $ 401 $ 479 (16.2) % — % — % (16.2) %\nNote: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\n(1) Parts and services organic revenue decreased 10.7% (11.1% on a per day basis) for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by lower parts volumes from a reduced number of customer\nadmissions.\n(2) Other organic revenue decreased 19.5%, or $58 million, year over year due to a $32 million decrease in revenue from\nprecious metals due to lower prices and lower volumes and a $26 million decrease in revenue from scrap steel primarily\nrelated to lower volumes and, to a lesser extent, lower prices.\nSegment EBITDA\nSegment EBITDA increased $11 million, or 36.2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year\nperiod. This is driven by improved vehicle procurement costs and operational productivity, partially offset by lower volumes\nand lower commodities prices compared to the prior year period. Decreases in precious metals prices contributed an estimated\n$13 million decline in Segment EBITDA relative to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, scrap steel prices had a $2 million unfavorable impact on Segment EBITDA, compared to a $3 million\nfavorable impact during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The unfavorable impacts for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 resulted from decreases in scrap steel prices between the date we purchased a vehicle, which influences the\nprice we pay for a vehicle, and the date we scrapped a vehicle, which influences the price we receive for scrapping a vehicle.\n44\nThe following table summarizes the changes in Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in our Self Service segment:\nPercentage of Total\nSelf Service Segment Revenue\nSegment EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 6.0 %\nIncrease (decrease) due to:\nChange in gross margin 6.4 % (1)\nChange in segment operating expenses (2.7) % (2)\nSegment EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 9.7 %\nNote: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.\n(1) The increase in gross margin is attributable to improvements in vehicle procurement costs, partially offset by lower\ncommodities prices.\n(2) The increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects negative leverage effect of 4.2% from\ndecreases in metals revenue, partially offset by other individually immaterial factors representing a 1.5% favorable impact\nin the aggregate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe assess our liquidity and capital resources in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through\nboth internal development and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our revolving\ncredit facilities. We utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures, with the excess\namounts going towards paying dividends, repurchasing our common stock, paying down outstanding debt, or funding\nacquisitions. As we have pursued acquisitions as part of our historical growth strategy, our cash flows from operations have not\nalways been sufficient to cover our investing activities. To fund our acquisitions, we have accessed various forms of debt\nfinancing, including revolving credit facilities, term loans, and senior notes. We currently believe we have sufficient access to\ncapital markets to support our future growth objectives.\nThe following table summarizes liquidity data as of the dates indicated (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCapacity under revolving credit facilities $ 2,000 $ 2,000\nLess: Revolving credit facilities borrowings 713 914\nLess: Letters of credit 116 110\nAvailability under credit revolving facilities 1,171 976\nAdd: Cash and cash equivalents 353 299\nTotal liquidity $ 1,524 $ 1,275\nWe had $1,171 million available under our revolving credit facilities as of September 30, 2024. Combined with $353 million of\ncash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, we had $1,524 million in available liquidity, an increase of $249 million from\nour available liquidity as of December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of reducing our revolving credit facilities borrowings by\n$201 million.\n45\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $4,371 million total debt outstanding and $44 million current debt, including the following\nsenior debt (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nInterest Amount\nMaturity Date Rate Outstanding\nSenior Unsecured Credit Agreement:\nTerm loan payable January 2026 6.32 % $ 500\nRevolving credit facilities January 2028 6.33 % (1) 713\nSenior Unsecured Term Loan Agreement:\nTerm loan payable (CAD 700 million) July 2026 5.92 % 518\nUnsecured Senior Notes:\nU.S. Notes (2028) June 2028 5.75 % 800\nU.S. Notes (2033) June 2033 6.25 % 600\nEuro Notes (2028) (€250 million) April 2028 4.13 % 278\nEuro Notes (2031) (€750 million) March 2031 4.13 % 835\n(1) Interest rate derived via a weighted average\nIn March 2024, we completed an offering of €750 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.125% Euro Notes (2031). We\nused the net proceeds from the offering and cash on hand to pay outstanding indebtedness, including all of the outstanding €500\nmillion aggregate principal amount of the 3.875% Euro Notes (2024) and revolver borrowings, and pay accrued interest and\nrelated fees, premiums and expenses.\nWe believe that our current liquidity, cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods and access to\ncapital markets will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements. Our capital allocation strategy includes\nspending to support growth driven capital projects, returning stockholder value through the payment of dividends and\nrepurchasing shares of our common stock, completing highly synergistic tuck-in acquisitions and debt repayment.\nA summary of the dividend activity for our common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows:\nDividend Amount Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date\n$0.30 February 20, 2024 March 14, 2024 March 28, 2024\n$0.30 April 22, 2024 May 16, 2024 May 30, 2024\n$0.30 July 23, 2024 August 15, 2024 August 29, 2024\nOn October 22, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock, payable\non November 27, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 14, 2024.\nWe believe that our future cash flow generation will permit us to continue paying dividends in future periods; however, the\ntiming, amount and frequency of such future dividends will be subject to approval by our Board of Directors, and based on\nconsiderations of capital availability, and various other factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nWith $1,524 million of total liquidity as of September 30, 2024 and $44 million of current maturities, we have access to funds\nto meet our near term commitments. We have a surplus of current assets over current liabilities, which further reduces the risk\nof short-term cash shortfalls.\nOur Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement and our CAD Note both include two financial maintenance covenants: a maximum\ntotal leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio. The terms maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest\ncoverage ratio are specifically calculated per both the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement and CAD Note, and differ in\nspecified ways from comparable GAAP or common usage terms. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under\nboth our Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement and CAD Note as of September 30, 2024. The required debt covenants per both\n46\nthe Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement and CAD Note and our actual ratios with respect to those covenants are as follows as\nof September 30, 2024:\nCovenant Level Ratio Achieved as of September 30, 2024\nMaximum total leverage ratio 4.00 : 1.00 2.4\nMinimum interest coverage ratio 3.00 : 1.00 7.6\nThe indentures relating to our U.S. Notes and Euro Notes do not include financial maintenance covenants, and the indentures\nwill not restrict our ability to draw funds under the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement. The indentures do not prohibit\namendments to the financial covenants under the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement and CAD Note as needed.\nWhile we believe that we have adequate capacity under our existing revolving credit facilities to finance our current operations,\nfrom time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or\nmodification of our existing Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement to finance additional investments or to refinance existing debt\nobligations. There can be no assurance that additional funding, or refinancing of our Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, if\nneeded, will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. Furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to\nstockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs. Our failure to raise\ncapital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAs part of our effort to improve our operating cash flows, we may negotiate payment term extensions with suppliers. These\nefforts are supported by our supply chain finance programs. See Note 12, \"Supply Chain Financing\" to the Unaudited\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information related to\nour supply chain financing arrangements.\nWe hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings. After giving effect to\nthese contracts outstanding, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our Senior Unsecured Credit\nAgreement was 6.0% at September 30, 2024. Including our senior notes and CAD Note, our overall weighted average interest\nrate on borrowings was 5.5% at September 30, 2024. Under the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, our borrowings bear\ninterest at SOFR plus the applicable spread or other risk-free interest rates that are applicable for the specified currency plus a\nspread. Under the CAD Note, the interest rate may be (i) a forward-looking term rate based on the CORRA for an interest\nperiod chosen by the Company of one or three months or (ii) the Canadian Prime Rate (as defined in the CAD Note), plus in\neach case a spread. See Note 13, \"Long-Term Obligations\" to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in\nPart I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information related to our borrowings and related interest. The interest\nrate swaps are described in Note 14, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" to the Unaudited Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe had outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and term loans payable of $1,731 million and $1,943\nmillion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of these amounts, there were no current maturities at\nSeptember 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nThe scheduled maturities of long-term obligations outstanding at September 30, 2024 are as follows (in millions):\nAmount\nThree months ending December 31, 2024 (1) $ 17\nYears ending December 31:\n2025 38\n2026 1,042\n2027 17\n2028 1,801\nThereafter 1,456\nTotal debt (2) $ 4,371\n(1) Long-term obligations maturing by December 31, 2024 include $8 million of short-term debt that may be extended beyond\nthe current year ending December 31, 2024.\n(2) The total debt amounts presented above reflect the gross values to be repaid (excluding debt issuance costs and\nunamortized bond discounts of $35 million as of September 30, 2024).\n47\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $353 million, of which $289 million was held by\nforeign subsidiaries. In general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign\nsubsidiaries. We believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the U.S. without\nrepatriating our foreign earnings. We may, from time to time, choose to selectively repatriate foreign earnings if doing so\nsupports our financing or liquidity objectives. Distributions of dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, if any, would be\ngenerally exempt from further U.S. taxation, either as a result of the 100% participation exemption under the Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct enacted in 2017, or due to the previous taxation of foreign earnings under the transition tax and the Global Intangible Low-\nTaxed Income regime.\nThe procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds. We normally pay for aftermarket product purchases on\nstandard payment terms or at the time of shipment, depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms. We\nnormally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under direct procurement arrangements at the time that we\ntake possession of the vehicles.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our aftermarket and manufactured inventory procurement for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nWholesale - North America $ 448 $ 423 $ 25 $ 1,498 $ 959 $ 539 (1)\nEurope 946 930 16 2,830 2,764 66 (2)\nSpecialty 290 356 (66) 969 916 53 (3)\nTotal $ 1,684 $ 1,709 $ (25) $ 5,297 $ 4,639 $ 658\n(1) Inventory purchases across the Wholesale - North America segment increased in the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the acquisition of Uni-Select.\n(2) The increase in inventory purchases in our Europe segment included an increase of $25 million attributable to the increase\nin the value of the pound sterling and, to a lesser extent, the euro in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared\nto the prior year period.\n(3) The increase in inventory purchases in the Specialty segment compared to the prior year period was primarily due to\nlower purchasing activity in the prior year as purchasing activity was reduced to align inventory levels with demand.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our global wholesale salvage and self service procurement for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nWholesale - North America salvage vehicles 62 60 3.3 % 189 189 — %\nEurope wholesale salvage vehicles 6 7 (14.3) % 22 22 — %\nSelf Service salvage vehicles 117 117 — % 340 397 (14.4) %\nSelf Service salvage purchases decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relative to the prior year period due to a\nfocus on reducing car cost.\n48\nThe following table summarizes the components of the year over year changes in cash provided by operating activities (in\nmillions):\nOperating Cash\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 $ 1,144\nIncrease (decrease) due to:\nWorking capital accounts: (1)\nReceivables (19)\nInventories (176)\nAccounts payable 53\nOther operating activities (116) (2)\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 $ 886\n(1) Cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases, payments and collections can\nbe timed differently from period to period.\n• Inventories represented $176 million in incremental cash outflows in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the\nsame period of 2023, including $112 million in our Europe segment primarily due to lower purchasing levels in the\nprior period following higher purchasing levels in 2022 due to restocking efforts to rebuild inventory levels, $40\nmillion in our Specialty segment due to the benefit in the prior year period of decreasing inventory purchasing levels to\nalign with softening demand and $28 million in our Wholesale - North America segment, partially offset by our Self\nService segment which contributed a $4 million higher cash inflow.\n• Accounts payable produced $53 million in incremental cash inflows in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the\nsame period of 2023. This was primarily attributable to higher cash inflows in our Wholesale - North America segment\nof $34 million and $15 million in our Specialty segment due to timing of payments.\n(2) Primarily reflects the aggregate effect of lower cash earnings and higher interest payments (primarily due to additional\nborrowings for the Uni-Select Acquisition and higher interest rates), partially offset by lower cash paid for taxes during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $300 million and $2,389 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. We invested $46 million and $2,199 million of cash in business acquisitions during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Property, plant and equipment purchases were $225 million in the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 compared to $233 million in the prior year period. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, we settled our foreign exchange forward contracts with the counterparties and received $49 million due\nprimarily to strengthening in the Canadian exchange rate relative to the contract rates.\nThe following table reconciles Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow (in millions):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 886 $ 1,144\nLess: purchases of property, plant and equipment 225 233\nFree cash flow $ 661 $ 911\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities totaled $516 million compared to net cash\nprovided by financing activities of $1,391 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to proceeds (net of\nunamortized bond discounts) of $1,394 million from the issuance of the U.S. Notes (2028/33) for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Cash outflows for share repurchases were $280 million and dividends paid were $240 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 compared to $8 million for share repurchases and $222 million for dividends paid for the\nsame period of 2023. Net debt borrowings (net of unamortized bond discounts) were $45 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to $282 million (excluding proceeds from the issuance of the U.S. Notes (2028/33) of $1,394\nmillion) for the same period of 2023.\nWe intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers,\nprocessing and sales facilities, and warehouses, through further integration of our facilities, and through selected business\nacquisitions. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the costs and timing of\nour internal development efforts and the success of those efforts.\n49\nSummarized Guarantor Financial Information\nOur U.S. Notes (2028/2033) and Euro Notes (2031) are guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by certain of our subsidiaries\n(each, a “subsidiary guarantor” and, together with LKQ, the “Obligor Group”), which are listed in Exhibit 22.1 in Part II, Item 6\nof this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
