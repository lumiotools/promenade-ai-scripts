[Healthcare Triangle, Inc.](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/search/organization/Healthcare%2520Triangle%CE%B4%2520Inc)\n\nPLEASANTON, Calif., April 04, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Healthcare Triangle, Inc. (Nasdaq: HCTI) (“Healthcare Triangle,” “HCTI” or the “Company”), a leading provider of healthcare IT solutions, is thrilled to announce its partnership with Cynomi, a pioneer vCISO platform vendor. This collaboration introduces an innovative Virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) service tailored specifically for the healthcare provider market, setting a new standard in cybersecurity and compliance.\n\nThe vCISO platform, powered by Cynomi’s cutting-edge AI technology, offers a comprehensive solution designed to continuously assess and enhance clients’ cybersecurity and compliance posture. By implementing strategic cybersecurity remediation plans and, conducting continuous security assessments and executing rigorous external scans, the platform identifies and addresses critical vulnerabilities across externally visible IPs and URLs, including but not limited to ports, protocols, encryption, and websites.\n\nThis partnership aims to empower healthcare providers with complete visibility into their cybersecurity and compliance status, enabling them to effectively manage their cyber posture, maintain rigorous compliance standards, and significantly reduce their risk of cyber threats.\n\nAnand Kumar, Interim CEO of Healthcare Triangle, underscored the importance of this offering, stating, “The United States is the number one targeted country in the world, with the healthcare industry being the most targeted vertical within. Our collaboration with Cynomi is poised to provide continuous security and compliance, safeguarding healthcare customers against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.” Many healthcare organizations across the country simply do not have the budget available to them for a full-time Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). The Cynomi solution gives organizations, without a CISO, the detailed insight into their security posture needed to help mitigate the risk of frequent cyber attacks seen in the healthcare provider space.\n\n“Healthcare Triangle’s partnership with Cynomi is a testament of the company’s commitment to providing its clients with top quality cybersecurity. Healthcare Triangle is known for its adoption of top-notch technologies to support the healthcare industry, and we are thrilled to take part in this initiative which will enable healthcare organizations enjoy CISO-level security“ said David Primor, PhD, co-founder and CEO of Cynomi.\n\nHealthcare Triangle’s partnership with Cynomi reflects a shared commitment to advancing healthcare cybersecurity. Through this collaboration, healthcare providers can now access a level of security and compliance previously unattainable, ensuring the protection of sensitive data and continuity of care.\n\n**About Cynomi** Cynomi’s vCISO platform empowers MSSPs, MSPs and consultancies to offer structured cybersecurity services to SMEs at scale and provide them with proactive cyber resilience.\n\nCombining proprietary AI algorithms with CISO-level knowledge, Cynomi helps partners overcome the cybersecurity skill gap and scale their business, allowing them to offer new services and increase revenues while reducing operational costs.\n\nTo learn more about Cynomi’s solution for MSPs, MSSPs, and cyber consultancies visit [www.cynomi.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=grEgz1uS5kb0GUYKjj4g5bPNWFq4LcZ2nOiIqiN2OYEGSJSPNiMlGuJqHZ8AZsw_6hYhM7XO0MeNPveR7OZ78Q==).\n\n**About the Healthcare Triangle** Healthcare Triangle, Inc. based in Pleasanton, California, reinforces healthcare progress through breakthrough technology and extensive industry knowledge and expertise.
