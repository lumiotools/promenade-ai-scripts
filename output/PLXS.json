Fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $1.05 billion, non-GAAP operating margin of 6.2% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.85 all exceeded guidance, while quarterly free cash flow of $194 million was a record and substantially exceeded our projections.”_\n\n_Mr. Kelsey continued, “During fiscal 2024, we continued to create value for our shareholders, our team members, our customers and our communities by advancing our sustainable and responsible business practices. Our team made meaningful progress in reducing our global waste-to-landfill and Scope 1 and 2 emissions, donated more than $1 million through our Plexus Community Foundation and contributed more than 20,000 paid volunteer hours to our local communities. In addition, Plexus was named one of the Top 100 U.S. Internship Programs for 2024 by Yello and Business Friend of the Environment by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce in recognition of our dedication to environmental stewardship, our sustainable business practices and our vision to help create the products that build a better world.”_\n\n_Pat Jermain, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, “Fiscal fourth quarter cash cycle of 64 days was favorable to our expectations and sequentially lower by 19 days as we benefited from increased revenue and continued progress on our working capital initiatives. This level of cash cycle was the best result we delivered in the past four years.”_\n\n_Mr. Jermain continued, “For fiscal 2024, we generated record free cash flow of $341 million, representing more than double our previous record performance and three times our fiscal 2024 net income. With the exceptional free cash flow, we continued to execute our share repurchase programs and reduce our borrowing, ending the year in a net cash position. Cash of approximately $347 million was sequentially higher by $78 million, while borrowing under our revolving credit facility was sequentially lower by $100 million. Finally, while we expect increased investments to support future growth, we anticipate delivering robust fiscal 2025 free cash flow of $50 million to $100 million and deploying excess cash to create additional shareholder value.”_\n\n_Mr. Kelsey added, “We are guiding fiscal first quarter revenue of $960 million to $1.00 billion, non-GAAP operating margin of 5.7% to 6.1% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.52 to $1.67. Although revenue is impacted by the better than anticipated fiscal fourth quarter results, we expect to maintain our strong operating margin performance of recent quarters. We anticipate a return to sequential revenue growth with our fiscal second quarter.”_\n\n_Mr. Kelsey concluded, “We are positioned to continue to create substantial shareholder value in fiscal 2025. We anticipate meaningful fiscal 2025 EPS growth to result from continued robust Aerospace/Defense market sector demand, modest revenue growth in the Healthcare/Life Sciences and Industrial market sectors associated with new program ramps and market share gains, ongoing solid operating margin performance and reduced debt.”_\n\n**Quarterly & Annual Comparison**| Three Months Ended| Twelve Months Ended  \n---|---|---  \n _(in thousands, except EPS)_|  Sep 28, 2024| Jun 29, 2024| Sep 30, 2023| Sep 28, 2024| Sep 30, 2023  \nRevenue| $| 1,050,569| $| 960,751| $| 1,023,947| $| 3,960,827| $| 4,210,305  \nGross profit| 107,912| 94,415| 96,716| 378,530| 394,554  \nOperating income| 53,858| 39,246| 53,333| 167,732| 195,820  \nNet income| 41,221| 25,140| 40,261| 111,815| 139,094  \nDiluted EPS| $| 1.48| $| 0.91| $| 1.44| $| 4.01| $| 4.95  \nGross margin| 10.3| %| 9.8| %| 9.4| %| 9.6| %| 9.4| %  \nOperating margin| 5.1| %| 4.1| %| 5.2| %| 4.2| %| 4.7| %  \nROIC (1)| 11.8| %| 10.4| %| 13.4| %| 11.8| %| 13.4| %  \nEconomic return (1)| 3.6| %| 2.2| %| 4.4| %| 3.6| %| 4.4| %  \n_(1) Refer to Non-GAAP Supplemental Information in Tables 1 and 2 for non-GAAP financial measures discussed and/or disclosed in this release, such as adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, ROIC and economic return._  \n  \n**Business Segment and Market Sector Revenue**\n\nPlexus measures operational performance and allocates resources on a geographic segment basis.

In addition, management uses these and other non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, to provide a better understanding of core performance for purposes of period-to-period comparisons. Plexus believes that these measures are also useful to investors because they provide further insight by eliminating the effect of non-recurring items that are not reflective of continuing operations. For additional information on non-GAAP measures, please refer to the attached Non-GAAP Supplemental Information tables.\n\n**ROIC and Economic Return**\n\nROIC for fiscal year 2024 was 11.8%. Plexus defines ROIC as tax-effected annualized adjusted operating income divided by average invested capital over a five-quarter period for the fiscal year. Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt and operating lease obligations, less cash and cash equivalents. Plexus' weighted average cost of capital for fiscal 2024 was 8.2%. ROIC for fiscal year 2024 less Plexus’ weighted average cost of capital resulted in an economic return of 3.6%.\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nPlexus defines free cash flow as cash flows provided by operations less capital expenditures. For the three months ended September 28, 2024, cash flows provided by operations was $220.1 million, less capital expenditures of $26.3 million, resulting in free cash flow of $193.8 million. For the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, cash flows provided by operations was $436.5 million, less capital expenditures of $95.2 million, resulting in free cash flow of $341.3 million.\n\n**Cash Cycle Days**|  Three Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSep 28, 2024| Jun 29, 2024| Sep 30, 2023  \nDays in Accounts Receivable| 54| 61| 59  \nDays in Contract Assets| 10| 11| 13  \nDays in Inventory| 127| 151| 154  \nDays in Accounts Payable| (59)| (62)| (64)  \nDays in Advanced Payments| (68)| (78)| (75)  \nAnnualized Cash Cycle (1)| 64| 83| 87  \n _(1_|  _)_| _Plexus calculates cash cycle as the sum of days in accounts receivable, days in contract assets and days in inventory, less days in accounts payable and days in advanced payments._  \n  \n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\n**What:** | Plexus Fiscal 2024 Q4 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast  \n---|---  \n**When:** | Thursday, October 24, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time  \n**Where:** | Participants are encouraged to join the live webcast at the investor relations section of the Plexus website, [plexus.com](http://plexus.com).

Revenue of $961 million was within our guidance range, while non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS of 5.8% and $1.45, respectively, exceeded our guidance ranges. We generated free cash flow of $114 million, representing the second best quarterly performance in our history.__”_\n\n_Mr. Kelsey continued, “We delivered fiscal third quarter new manufacturing program wins worth $279 million in annualized revenue, including a record contribution within Healthcare/Life Sciences. In addition, we are seeing increasing market sector diversification in the demand for our engineering solutions, resulting in the team achieving the highest level of new business wins in the past four quarters.”_\n\n_Patrick Jermain, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, “The $114 million of free cash flow generated during the fiscal third quarter significantly exceeded our expectations. Continued progress on our working capital initiatives contributed to this strong performance, resulting in fiscal third quarter cash cycle of 83 days, three days favorable to our expectations and sequentially lower by eight days. Given this performance, we now anticipate delivering in excess of $150 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2024. The ongoing benefits from our working capital initiatives combined with increasing profitability is anticipated to result in continued strong free cash flow generation in fiscal 2025. Finally, we reduced our borrowing by $89 million and repurchased $18.6 million of our shares during the fiscal third quarter. We expect to continue to execute upon the remaining $19.5 million of our current repurchase authorization during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, creating additional shareholder value.”_\n\n_Mr. Kelsey added, “We are witnessing signs of strengthening demand across each of our market sectors, with share gains and new program ramps further bolstering our ongoing and continued expectations for revenue growth. As a result, we are guiding fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $990 million to $1.03 billion, non-GAAP operating margin of 5.6% to 6.0% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.50 to $1.65.”_\n\n_Mr. Kelsey concluded, “Consistent with prior expectations, we anticipate delivering a strong finish to our fiscal 2024, with sequential expansion in revenue, robust operating margin performance, sequential growth in EPS and continued free cash flow generation. We expect sustained revenue growth momentum into fiscal 2025, capitalizing upon Aerospace/Defense market sector strength, increasing Healthcare/Life Sciences customer forecasts aided by new program ramps, and improved semiconductor capital equipment and broadband communications demand. We anticipate revenue growth momentum, the benefits from optimizing our business for greater efficiency during fiscal 2024 and ongoing free cash flow deployment toward debt reduction and share repurchases will create meaningful EPS growth in fiscal 2025.”_\n\n**Quarterly Comparison**|  Three Months Ended  \n---|---  \n _(in thousands, except EPS)_|  Jun 29, 2024| Mar 30, 2024| Jul 1, 2023  \nRevenue| $| 960,751| $| 966,900| $| 1,021,610  \nGross profit| 94,415| 88,063| 93,646  \nOperating income| 39,246| 29,470| 28,204  \nNet income| 25,140| 16,239| 15,799  \nDiluted EPS| $| 0.91| $| 0.58| $| 0.56  \nGross margin| 9.8| %| 9.1| %| 9.2| %  \nOperating margin| 4.1| %| 3.0| %| 2.8| %  \nROIC (1)| 10.4| %| 9.9| %| 13.5| %  \nEconomic return (1)| 2.2| %| 1.7| %| 4.5| %  \n_(1) Refer to Non-GAAP Supplemental Information in Tables 1 and 2 for non-GAAP financial measures discussed and/or disclosed in this release, such as adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, ROIC and economic return._  \n  \n**Business Segment and Market Sector Revenue**\n\nPlexus measures operational performance and allocates resources on a geographic segment basis. Plexus also reports revenue based on the market sector breakout set forth in the table below, which reflects Plexus’ market sector focused strategy. Top 10 customers comprised 48% of revenue during both the second and third quarter of fiscal 2024. This is down three percentage points from the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\n**Business Segments ($ in millions)**|  Three Months Ended  \n---|---  \nJun 29, 2024| Mar 30, 2024| Jul 1, 2023  \nAmericas| $| 332| $| 322| $| 371  \nAsia-Pacific| 522| 521| 572  \nEurope, Middle East and Africa| 137| 155| 105  \nElimination of inter-segment sales| (30| )| (31| )| (26| )  \nTotal Revenue| $| 961| $| 967| $| 1,022  \n  \n**Market Sectors ($ in millions)**|  Three Months Ended  \n---|---  \nJun 29, 2024| Mar 30, 2024| Jul 1, 2023  \nHealthcare/Life Sciences| $| 380| 40| %| $| 379| 39| %| $| 451| 44| %  \nIndustrial| 403| 42| %| 418| 43| %| 428| 42| %  \nAerospace/Defense| 178| 18| %| 170| 18| %| 143| 14| %  \nTotal Revenue| $| 961| $| 967| $| 1,022  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Supplemental Information**\n\nPlexus provides non-GAAP supplemental information, such as ROIC, economic return and free cash flow because such measures are used for internal management goals and decision-making, and because they provide management and investors with additional insight into financial performance. In addition, management uses these and other non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, to provide a better understanding of core performance for purposes of period-to-period comparisons. Plexus believes that these measures are also useful to investors because they provide further insight by eliminating the effect of non-recurring items that are not reflective of continuing operations. For additional information on non-GAAP measures, please refer to the attached Non-GAAP Supplemental Information tables.\n\n**ROIC and Economic Return**\n\nROIC for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 10.4%. Plexus defines ROIC as tax-effected annualized adjusted operating income divided by average invested capital over a four-quarter period for the third fiscal quarter. Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt and operating lease obligations, less cash and cash equivalents. Our weighted average cost of capital for fiscal 2024 is 8.2%. ROIC for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 less our weighted average cost of capital resulted in an economic return of 2.2%.\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nPlexus defines free cash flow as cash flows provided by operations less capital expenditures. For the three months ended June 29, 2024, cash flows provided by operations were $131.6 million and capital expenditures were $17.4 million, which resulted in free cash flow of $114.2 million.\n\n**Cash Cycle Days**|  Three Months Ended  \n---|---  \nJun 29, 2024| Mar 30, 2024| Jul 1, 2023  \nDays in Accounts Receivable| 61| 61| 63  \nDays in Contract Assets| 11| 12| 12  \nDays in Inventory| 151| 158| 161  \nDays in Accounts Payable| (62)| (65)| (68)  \nDays in Advanced Payments (1)| (78)| (75)| (78)  \nAnnualized Cash Cycle (2)| 83| 91| 90  \n  \n_(1)_| _Includes a reclassification in the presentation of advanced payments from customers reflected in prior period amounts.

[ Streaming ] today\nare Todd Kelsey, President and Chief Executive Officer; Oliver Mihm, Executive Vice President and Chief\nOperating Officer; Pat Jermain, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWith today's earnings call, Todd will provide summary comments before turning the call over to Oliver and\nPat for further details.\nBefore I turn the call over to Todd, please note that during our fiscal first quarter, Plexus will participate in\nStifel's Midwest One-on-One Conference in Chicago on November 7th, the Raymond James 2024 TMT and\nConsumer Conference in New York City on December 10th.\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Todd Kelsey. Todd?\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThank you, Shawn. Good morning, everyone.\nPlease advance to Slide 3. Plexus exited fiscal 2024 with exceptional performance, a testament to the\ndedication and focus of our more than 20,000 team members globally. Our team's commitment to\ndelivering customer service excellence resulted in Plexus gaining market share throughout fiscal 2024,\npositioning us for a solid fiscal 2025, and capturing pull-in data late in the fiscal fourth quarter, leading to\nthe exceptional quarterly results.\nIn addition, our team's ongoing focus on driving efficiency and increasing operating margin resulted in\nPlexus achieving our 6-plus percent non-GAAP operating margin goal one year earlier than anticipated,\nproducing robust quarterly EPS. We also generated record free cash flow of $194 million in the quarter.\nThe stellar free cash flow performance pushed our fiscal 2024 free cash flow generation to $341 million,\nrepresenting more than 2x our previous record annual free cash flow.\nWe continue to anticipate revenue growth for fiscal 2025, while noting trends within our market sectors\nremain mixed.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 3\nPLEXUS CORP. FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 24, 2024\nWe anticipate another strong year for our aerospace and defense market sector aided by ongoing share\ngains and new program ramps. While we expect modest growth from Healthcare/Life Sciences and\nindustrial market sectors supported by demand recovering in certain subsectors, new program ramps,\nand share gains. We remain focused on maintaining our strong operating margin performance of recent\nquarters, producing meaningful growth in EPS and generating free cash flow that will continue to be\ndeployed toward creating additional shareholder value.\nPlease advance to Slide 4. We delivered tremendous fiscal fourth quarter financial results. Revenue of\n$1.05 billion exceeded our guidance range. As the quarter progressed, we experienced stronger demand\nand a pull-in of activity with customers across multiple market sectors that more than offset ongoing\ndemand weakness in the industrial market sector in the EMEA region.\nNon-GAAP operating margin of 6.2% met our long-term goal, expanding 40 basis points sequentially and\nexceeding our 5.6% to 6.0% guidance range. Our focus on driving operational efficiency led to healthy\nmargin leverage [ and ] the late quarter demand surge. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.85 also exceeded our\nguidance range, benefiting from revenue upside, robust operating margin performance, further reduction\nin interest expense, and a favorable tax rate.\nPlease advance to Slide 5. For the fiscal fourth quarter, we won 26 manufacturing programs worth $230\nmillion in annual revenue when fully ramped into production. Included in this result is another strong\nquarterly contribution from the Healthcare/Life Sciences market sector of $148 million. For fiscal 2024,\nour go-to-market team generated more than $1 billion of manufacturing program wins, including a record\n$568 million of program wins in the Healthcare/Life Sciences market sector, supporting our anticipation of\nexceptional revenue growth for this market sector over the long-term.\nPlease advance to Slide 6. We continue to create value for our shareholders, our team members, our\ncustomers, and communities through our sustainable and responsible business practices. The following\nare highlights from fiscal 2024. We reduced our waste-to-landfill by over 10% globally, double our 5%\ngoal through increased recycling and reuse, strategic vendor selection, and reduced waste generation.\nWe reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by over 5% across Plexus's global manufacturing sites as we\ncontinue to improve operational efficiencies, optimize technology, and transition to cleaner sources of\nenergy.\nIn support of our social impact efforts, we donated more than $1 million globally through the Plexus\nCommunity Foundation. Our team members contributed over 20,000 paid volunteer hours to their\nlocal communities, surpassing our fiscal 2023 engagement. And we continue to drive sustainable and\nresponsible business practices across our value chain. We assessed over 50% of our global supply chain\nspend on environmental and social factors as we help our customers deliver more sustainable products to\nthe market.\nFinally, this past quarter, we were thrilled to be named one of the Top 100 U.S. Internship Programs for\n2024 by Yello, recognizing the investment in our people who are at the heart of who we are and what we\ndo.\nWe also received the Business Friend of the Environment Award for Sustainability in the Large Company\ncategory presented by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce. This is in recognition of our dedication to\nenvironmental stewardship, sustainable business practices, and our vision to help create the products that\nbuild a better world. Thanks to all of our team members who supported these achievements, that we will\ncontinue to build upon throughout fiscal 2025.\nPlease advance to Slide 7. We begin fiscal 2025 in a strong position, given healthier improved conditions\nfor many of our market sectors and subsectors, solid fiscal 2024 new program wins performance inclusive\nof market share gains enabled by our focus on delivering customer service excellence, the expansion and\nprofitability witnessed throughout fiscal 2024 associated with our focus on driving efficiency and increasing\noperational performance, and the EPS leverage created from deploying our outstanding free cash flow\ntoward reducing our borrowing and completing our share repurchase program.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nPLEXUS CORP. FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 24, 2024\nWe are guiding fiscal first quarter revenue in the range of $960 million to $1.0 billion, non-GAAP operating\nmargin of 5.7% to 6.1%, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.52 to $1.67. After the stronger than anticipated finish\nto fiscal 2024, along with an ongoing challenged demand environment in EMEA, we expect sequential\nrevenue growth to pause with our fiscal first quarter before resuming as the fiscal year continues.\nFor fiscal 2025, we expect robust revenue growth within aerospace and defense, reflecting a continuation\nof end market strength, new program ramps, and market share gains, moderate growth in Healthcare/\nLife Sciences as we navigate through any remaining inventory corrections, while benefiting from new\nprogram ramps, share gains, and a modest rebound in healthcare market demand, and moderate growth\nin industrial, reflecting robust growth in SemiCap, exceeding third-party market recovery forecasts, but a\nbroader industrial market that remains challenged by inventory corrections and weak demand.\nWe anticipate our efforts to continue to increase operational efficiency will result in maintaining the\nstrong operating margin performance of recent quarters, while EPS should witness meaningful expansion,\nleveraging revenue growth, strong profitability, and the ongoing benefits from deploying our substantial\nfree cash flow generation toward creating shareholder value.\nI will now turn the call over to Oliver for additional analysis of the performance of our market sectors.\nOliver?\nOliver K. Mihm\nExecutive VP & COO\nThank you, Todd. Good morning. I will begin with a review of the fiscal fourth quarter performance of each\nof our market sectors, our expectations for each sector for the fiscal first quarter, and some directional\nsector commentary for fiscal 2025. I will also review the annualized revenue contribution of our wins\nperformance for each market sector and region, and then provide an overview of our funnel of qualified\nmanufacturing opportunities.\nStarting with our aerospace and defense sector on Slide 8, revenue increased 3% sequentially in the\nfiscal fourth quarter, above our expectation for flat revenue. Multiple customers drove the revenue upside,\nreflecting increased demand inside the quarter and stronger than anticipated demand for our engineering\nsolutions, which more than offset cautiousness stemming from uncertainty in the commercial aerospace\nsubsector.\nConsistent with prior guidance, fiscal 2024 represented a very strong growth year for the aerospace and\ndefense sector with revenue up 21%, exceeding the robust growth we saw in fiscal 2023 of 17%. We\nexpect revenue for the aerospace and defense sector to decline high single-digits in the fiscal first quarter,\nwith the pooling of activity into Q4 and customer conservatism in the commercial aerospace subsector,\nmore than offsetting strength in our space subsector.\nOur wins for the fiscal fourth quarter for the aerospace and defense sector were strong at $45 million, and\nincluded a complex product assembly for our Boise, Idaho facility. This program win further solidifies our\nrelationship with one of the largest defense prime contractors.\nWe also won our first manufacturing award from a defense customer where we have maintained a\nlongstanding engineering solutions engagement. This program will be built in our Neenah, Wisconsin\nfacility.\nFinally, engineering solutions wins for the aerospace and defense sector hit a record high in fiscal 2024,\nreflecting continued progress and diversifying our opportunities to generate growth. Our fiscal 2025\naerospace and defense market sector outlook continues to be bullish, supported by new program ramp\nstrength in our defense subsector, and our expectation that uncertainty in the commercial aerospace\nsubsector will resolve as the year progresses.\nPlease advance to Slide 9. Revenue in our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector was up 9% sequentially for the\nfiscal third quarter on the strength of inside the quarter demand increases and a pooling of demand for a\nnew product launch. This beat our expectations of a mid-single digit increase.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\nPLEXUS CORP. FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 24, 2024\nFiscal 2024 for our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector saw a 17% revenue decline as a result of inventory\ncorrections and demand softness, as well as the discussed headwind from the normalization of previously\nprocuring components at above market prices. For the fiscal first quarter, we expect the Healthcare/Life\nSciences sector to decline high single-digits, reflecting some continued inventory corrections and the\npooling of activity into the fiscal fourth quarter. This dynamic is more than offsetting continued momentum\nfrom our engineering solutions.\nHealthcare/Life Sciences sector wins for the fiscal fourth quarter marked the second consecutive quarter\nof strong performance at $148 million. Wins included 2 significant awards from an existing customer for\nour Neenah, Wisconsin manufacturing facility. One of these awards represents new outsourcing work\nand reflects on the depth of our experience in the subsector, the strength of our historical execution\nfrom our ongoing sustaining services engagement, and our ability to contribute world class engineering,\ncommercialization and development resources in support of customer success.\nWe also won the production of a therapeutic device for an existing customer based on a historical\nexecution in support of their new product launches. This product will be produced in our Chicago, Illinois\nfacility.\nThe aggregate wins for the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector for fiscal 2024 reflect a record high, and a\nremarkable 69% year-over-year increase. As we look to our fiscal 2025, we remain optimistic for a return\nto growth for the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector, benefiting from the ongoing strength and program\nramps, modest end market improvements, and normalization of inventories.\nAdvancing to the industrial sector on Slide 10, revenue increased 12% sequentially in the fiscal fourth\nquarter. The result was above our expectation of a high single-digit increase and primarily driven by inside\nthe quarter demand increases from customers in our SemiCap and energy subsectors.\nFiscal 2024 saw a 3% revenue decline for the industrial sector, a strength in new program ramps, and the\nbeginnings of a SemiCap subsector recovery were more than offset by generally soft demand in various\nsubsectors working through an inventory correction.\nLooking ahead to the fiscal first quarter, continued demand improvement in SemiCap is being more than\noffset by some industrial subsectors continuing to work through demand instability, the revenue upside\nexperienced in the fiscal fourth quarter, and near-term program volatility with 2 customers. As a result, we\nexpect revenue to decline mid-single digits in the industrial sector for the fiscal first quarter.\nIndustrial market sector wins for the fiscal fourth quarter of $37 million included a next generation product\nwin with an existing test and measurement customer. Our wins also included share gains on 2 platforms\nfor an existing SemiCap customer. These products will be built in our Penang, Malaysia campus.\nWe are also pleased to note that an existing customer with a leadership position in the energy subsector\nhas audited our Boise, the Idaho facility and confirmed that Plexus quality system is compliant to NQA-1.\nThis is ASME's Nuclear Quality Assurance standard for firms providing services in support of nuclear\nenergy. Compliance to this standard expands our differentiation, enabling continued revenue growth.\nOur expectation for the industrial sector of a return to growth in fiscal 2025 remains unchanged. Our\nview is the general subsector instability will resolve as the year progresses, with market outgrowth and\nSemiCap offsetting industrial subsector market weakness.\nAdvancing to Slide 11, we can review the regional highlights of the manufacturing wins for the fiscal fourth\nquarter.\nThe America's wins were exceptionally strong at $195 million. This marks the second consecutive quarter\nof strong regional wins performance. Wins included a share gain award for our Neenah, Wisconsin facility\nfrom an existing customer in our space subsector that is seeing increasing product market acceptance.\nThis win reflects the strength of our collaborative relationship in support of helping launch their product\ninto the market. The APAC region's fiscal fourth quarter wins of $30 million included new programs with\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\nPLEXUS CORP. FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 24, 2024\n2 of our existing SemiCap customers. These assemblies will be built in our Penang, Malaysia campus. The\nawards are a result of our continued strong execution.\nThe aggregate fiscal 2024 wins for the APAC region increased 46% over the prior fiscal year. The EMEA\nregion's fiscal fourth quarter wins of $5 million included a new program award from an existing SemiCap\ncustomer. This award for our team in Scotland reflects continued share gain for Plexus as our customer\nexecutes to the strategic supplier road map.\nPlease advance to Slide 12 for a review of our funnel of qualified manufacturing opportunities. The funnel\nof qualified manufacturing opportunities remains robust at $3.5 billion, with a sequential decline reflective\nof the robust harvesting activity by our team and typical funnel management.\nIn summary, the strength of wins in fiscal 2024, the continued progress of new program ramps, and the\nnormalization of subsectors currently experiencing either uncertainty or inventory corrections, gives us\noptimism for growth in fiscal 2025.\nI will now turn the call over to Pat for an in-depth review of our financial performance. Pat?\nPatrick John Jermain\nExecutive VP & CFO\nThank you, Oliver, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal fourth quarter results are summarized on Slide\n13. Gross margin of 10.3% exceeded our guidance and was sequentially higher by 50 basis points. We\nrecognize significant fixed cost leverage as revenue sequentially increased 9%, while fixed manufacturing\nexpenses decreased slightly from last quarter. Efficiency gains and productivity improvements across all 3\nof our manufacturing regions led to the better than anticipated results.\nSelling and administrative expense of $54 million was above our guidance primarily due to additional\nincentive compensation expense linked to improved operating and cash flow performance. Non-GAAP\noperating margin of 6.2% exceeded our guidance due to the strong gross margin performance and\ndelivered on our target margin 1 year earlier than expected.\nNon-operating expense of $8.4 million met expectations. While we experienced a substantial reduction in\ninterest expense due to our robust cash flow performance, we did see higher levels of foreign exchange\nlosses this quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.85 exceeded the top end of our guidance due to the\nfactors mentioned along with a benefit from a favorable tax rate.\nTurning to our cash flow and balance sheet on Slide 14. We were extremely pleased with our free cash\nflow performance as we wrapped up the fiscal year. We delivered $220 million in cash from operations and\nspent $26 million on capital expenditures, resulting in free cash flow of $194 million. This result was well\nabove our expectations. As Todd mentioned, this was the highest performance in company history.\nFor fiscal 2024, we generated record free cash flow of $341 million, an outcome representing more than\ndouble our previous record and 3x our fiscal 2024 net income. With the strong performance, we reduced\nour total debt during the quarter by $102 million while continuing to support our share repurchase\nprogram.\nFor fiscal 2024, we reduced our total debt by $184 million. During the quarter, we purchased\napproximately 166,000 shares of our stock for $19.5 million, which completed the previously authorized\n$50 million share repurchase program. For fiscal 2024, we purchased $55.7 million of our stock at an\naverage price slightly below $104 per share.\nWe have now begun purchasing shares under the new $50 million program authorized during the fiscal\nfourth quarter. We ended the year in a net cash position. Cash of approximately $347 million was\nsequentially higher by $78 million. At the end of the fiscal year, we had $50 million outstanding under our\nrevolving credit facility with $450 million available to borrow under the facility. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA\nratio was at a conservative level of less than 1.\nFor the fiscal year, we delivered return on invested capital of 11.8%, which was 360 basis points above\nour weighted average cost of capital. Cash cycle at the end of the fiscal year was 64 days, 16 days\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\nPLEXUS CORP. FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 24, 2024\nfavorable to expectations and sequentially improved by 19 days. This level of cash cycle was the best\nresult delivered in the past 4 years.\nPlease turn to Slide 15 for details on this exceptional performance. Our cash cycle improvement primarily\ncame from a combination of lower accounts receivable and inventory days. Sequentially, days in\nreceivables improved by 7 days, led by fiscal year-end collection efforts.\nIncreased revenue and continued progress on our working capital initiatives contributed to a sizable\ninventory reduction of 24 days. Our teams delivered a sequential reduction in gross inventory of $123\nmillion and a reduction of over $250 million when compared to the fiscal 2023 year-end balance. As Todd\nhas already provided the revenue and EPS guidance for the fiscal first quarter, I'll review some additional\ndetails, which are summarized on Slide 16.\nFiscal first quarter gross margin is expected to be in the range of 10.1% to 10.4%. At the midpoint, gross\nmargin would be similar to the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect selling and administrative expense in the\nrange of $46.6 million to $47.6 million, which is inclusive of approximately $4.6 million of stock-based\ncompensation expense.\nFiscal first quarter non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 5.7% to 6.1%, exclusive\nof stock-based compensation expense and any restructuring activity. Nonoperating expense is anticipated\nto be approximately $6 million. This would represent a sequential improvement as we continue to deploy\nexcess cash to reduce our borrowing and related interest expense.\nFor the fiscal first quarter, we are estimating an effective tax rate between 14% and 16% and diluted\nshares outstanding of approximately 27.7 million. Our expectation for the balance sheet is that working\ncapital investments will increase compared to the fiscal fourth quarter. Based on our revenue forecast,\nwe expect this level of working capital will result in cash cycle days in the range of 71 to 75 days. This\nwould be sequentially higher by 9 days, primarily due to the return of advanced payments linked to our\ncontinuing inventory reduction efforts.\nWith higher investments to support anticipated revenue growth for fiscal 2025, we expect the usage of\ncash for the fiscal first quarter, a trend we have experienced the last several quarters. Despite this usage,\nwe expect to follow up the fiscal 2024 result with robust free cash flow in the range of $50 million to $100\nmillion for fiscal 2025. We plan to continue to deploy any excess cash to create additional shareholder\nvalue.\nOne additional comment on the full year. We expect capital spending in the range of $120 million to $150\nmillion, which is inclusive of approximately $60 million related to footprint expansion on the mainland of\nPenang, Malaysia. We continue to see significant growth opportunities in this region and are investing to\nensure we support broad-based customer interest in our services within the region.\nWith that, Bailey, let's now open the call for questions.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\nPLEXUS CORP. FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 24, 2024\nQuestion and Answer\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Williams with the Benchmark\nCompany.\nDavid Neil Williams\nThe Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division\nCongrats on the really solid results here.\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThanks, David.\nDavid Neil Williams\nThe Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division\nSo I guess the first question for me is really around the aerospace and defense, and you talked a bit about\nthis in your script. But just kind of curious how you're thinking about that for the year? Obviously, Boeing\nwithout the contract being renewed or resolved as we had hoped and maybe some of the conversation\nyesterday from their print just about the timing of that production coming back. How are you thinking\nabout that? And maybe how do you avoid the risk that could be associated with that as we think about the\nfull year in aerospace and defense?\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes, I'll start and maybe Oliver will want to add as we go through the discussion here. But certainly\ndisappointing that the Boeing strike wasn't resolved yesterday as I think a lot of people were anticipating.\nBut one of the things in our projections or as we went through our preparation for the call, we have been\nconservative in the way we've looked at Boeing. So when we talk about strong growth anticipated in\naerospace and defense, that takes a relatively conservative look at how the Boeing situation plays out.\nSo I think if we get some resolution in that, that could provide some potential upside opportunity for us.\nWe think at this point, we're reasonably de-risked for what the situation is today. So with that said, when\nwe think about the aerospace and defense sector for fiscal '25, looks like another strong growth year, not\nat the 21% level of '24, but certainly has the potential to be into the double-digits. And a lot of that is\ndriven through strength in new program ramps within our defense subsector.\nDavid Neil Williams\nThe Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. Very good. Great color there. I certainly appreciate it. And then maybe secondly here is just on the\nSemiCap equipment space. There's been a lot of, I think, variable discussion around the demand trends\nthere, some up, some down. It sounds like you've got several new program wins this quarter, and it's been\nan area of opportunity for you. So maybe just, as you think about the SemiCap equipment space, is there\nanything that you're concerned with? And how do you view that generally? Have you de-risked that, do\nyou think, for the trends? And just, I guess, maybe anything that goes into that estimation of demand for\nthe year on SemiCap?\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. I think in general, we're at a relatively conservative look at SemiCap as well too. Now we would\nexpect to -- and as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we'd expect to outgrow the market and outgrow\nmarket forecast because of share gains. So I think you can take any projections that you see out there\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 24, 2024\nfor WFE or SemiCap in general and expect that we're going to outperform that, as we have for the past\ndecade or so. So I think that's the way to think about SemiCap.\nSo we would expect it to be well into the double-digits from a growth here this year, even taking a\nconservative view.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Melissa Fairbanks with Raymond James & Associates.\nMelissa Ann Dailey Fairbanks\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\nI'll echo the congrats on the great quarter. I've got one for Oliver. Wondering if we could dig into the\nnon-SemiCap business in industrial? On the last call, you had guided to some recovery in the broadband\ncommunications sector. It had been pretty weak for quite some time. Just wondering if you could give us\nan update on that business and what the expectations are going forward?\nOliver K. Mihm\nExecutive VP & COO\nYes. Happy to answer that. Yes, our outlook for communications and what we build in here is a much\nmore flat look. Certainly, recognize the macro tailwinds that exist, and we talked about that in prior\nquarter. Certainly, our growth is tied to certain projects coming to fruition, but we also recognize that\nthose projects and the path to fruition is not always linear.\nMelissa Ann Dailey Fairbanks\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\nNo kidding. A lot of experience with that over the years. So for my follow-up, maybe for Pat, on the cash\ncycle outlook, obviously, really great reduction in 4Q. I know it's been a focus of the whole team. You've\nguided to the bump higher in 1Q. Can you remind us what the longer-term target is? How should we view\npeak to trough levels of investment? What the cash cycle days look like, especially with that $50 million to\n$100 million free cash flow target for the year?\nPatrick John Jermain\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. Sure can. I mean going back to the first quarter of fiscal '24, we were at 95 days. So to have a\nmidpoint now for Q1 to '25 of 73 days, a 22-day improvement, really pleased with. And to go to your\nquestion of 1 year ago, what we have been pleased with, we were kind of signaling mid-70s for cash cycle\nas a target. And obviously, hitting 64 at the end of this year kind of resets our expectations.\nSo as I look to '25, Melissa, yes, 73 days in Q1. We'll see an investment of cash in Q1. And just to correct\nmaybe something I said in the script, that's something we have typically seen every first quarter in the\nlast several years -- not several quarters, last several years, we've seen an investment of cash in the fiscal\nfirst quarter.\nI expect us to continue our inventory improvement efforts going through fiscal '25. We will see some\nreturn of advanced payments along with that inventory reduction. So my expectation is 73 will be a high\npoint for Q1 for '25, and then we'll start to steadily bring that down. Expectation would be to get back into\nthe 60s. Whether we get back to the 64 level, we'll see, but it has kind of reset my expectations that I'd\nlike to see it as more in the high 60s.\nMelissa Ann Dailey Fairbanks\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\nWow, that's fantastic. That's great. Maybe if I could just squeak in one quick follow-up. You did mention\nthe return of advanced payments. Are your customers -- now that we're in kind of like a more normalized\nsupply environment, are your customers still eager to give you some of those advanced payments? So\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\nPLEXUS CORP. FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 24, 2024\nlike if we see inventory going up, do you expect that to still be a balance of some customer commitments\nalong with your own working capital investment?\nPatrick John Jermain\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. I think where we see those typically is when inventory starts to age and get to a point of excess and\nobsolete is where we're pursuing those type of advanced payments. So I think that can still happen. But\nobviously, with supply chain improving, we're seeing less of that excess inventory.\nMelissa Ann Dailey Fairbanks\nRaymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Great.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company.\nChristopher Grenga\nNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division\nThis is Chris [ Grenga ] on for Jim. Congrats on the results.\nPatrick John Jermain\nExecutive VP & CFO\nThanks, Chris.\nChristopher Grenga\nNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division\nIs there any one thing that you could point to or that you could describe the pull-in during the quarter?\nYou mentioned there's a broad -- I guess, broad pull-in and that drove the stronger-than-expected results.\nIs there anything in particular that you would call out as a driver of that?\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. The interesting thing was it impacted every sector. So we saw -- and there were different reasons for\nthe pull-ins that we saw. Some were success of new program ramps. Others were demand -- just demand\nuptick that people saw with their end customers where they were looking for this. So we saw -- what\nwe saw was quite broad-based to the tune of close to $40 million. So one of the things -- I mean, we're\ncertainly cognizant that our revenue is sequentially down in Q1, but I think that $40 million impact, or\nnear $40 million impact is really what's causing that fact.\nChristopher Grenga\nNeedham & Company, LLC, Research Division\nGot it. And do you have a sense for how much longer the inventory imbalance or correction is expected\nto persist in health care, do you -- in conversations with customers, or do you have any visibility into how\nmuch longer you expect that dynamic to persist?\nOliver K. Mihm\nExecutive VP & COO\nYes, I'll take that. This is Oliver. Certainly, difficult to predict exactly when that's going to come out. I think\nlast time -- last quarter, we already talked about the fact that, as we look at our portfolio as a whole, we\nthought that the inventory correction dynamic, we had worked through 85% to 90% of that.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11\nPLEXUS CORP. FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 24, 2024\nI'll also note that we talked about engineering solutions revenue momentum here in this last quarter, and\nwe view that as generally a good leading indicator of decision-making and outlook for that sector. And so, I\nthink that gives us optimism here as we look to fiscal '25 for continued revenue growth.\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. A little additional color that I'd add here, Chris, is we're seeing the corrections flow through faster in\nhealthcare than in Life Sciences overall, and there are a couple -- But within health care, there's a couple\nof one-off situations where the corrections are still fairly significant.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.\nSteven Bryant Fox\nFox Advisors LLC\nJust following up on the pull-ins that you mentioned. Can you draw any conclusions? I know you said it\nwas broad-based, but is there any conclusions to draw from a macro standpoint? Or you just think it was\nall customers program specific? And along those lines, does it -- I understand why the pull-ins would sort\nof reduce your growth in FQ1. But what -- does it preclude you from growing, say, 10% for fiscal '25?\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. So maybe, Steve, I'll start by answering the '25 question, and then I'm going to pass it over to Oliver\nto provide some additional detail on the pull-ins. When we look at fiscal '25, I think with the, call it, slower\nstart from a revenue standpoint, with the pull-ins impacting the comparable of '24 as well as the revenue\nin '25, I think double-digits looks difficult, I would say. We're projecting mid-singles maybe a little higher\nas we look to fiscal '25.\nSo we think we can make good progress, and we expect some pretty strong sequential revenue growth on\na quarterly basis once we hit Q2 and move through the balance of the fiscal year.\nOliver K. Mihm\nExecutive VP & COO\nYes. And then adding on to that, I think as we reflect on the pull-ins, there were certainly a number of just\ncustomer-specific situations, Todd mentioned earlier, a specific program launch that had pulled in more\naggressively from the customer.\nTaking a step back and looking for some macro themes, we mentioned earlier in our remarks, space\nsubsector showed strength -- showing strength in Q1. We also talked about the SemiCap subsector. So\nthat grew sequentially in Q4 and continues to show underlying demand pickup. So that would be, I think,\nour other macro reflections on the overall trend.\nAnd we look at all of that, and we think we're -- again, I'd say well-positioned would be the term that\ncomes to mind as we contemplate the macro F '25 outlook.\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nAnd Shawn, one more thing -- I want to go back to the statement made about aerospace and defense.\nJust -- we added some conservatism in there as well. And so trying to adjust for the unknown related to\nthe Boeing supply chain.\nSteven Bryant Fox\nFox Advisors LLC\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 12\nPLEXUS CORP. FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 24, 2024\nGot it. That's helpful. And then just curious on the program volatility you called out with 2 customers. Can\nyou give us any further details on what that was about and whether that's an ongoing issue beyond the\nlast quarter?\nOliver K. Mihm\nExecutive VP & COO\nYes. I'll just note that for both of those, they're one-off situations. We are working with our customer to\nhelp them resolve that dynamic. And I'll also note that from my perspective, the demand for both of those\nprograms is not perishable.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nUnknown Analyst\nThis is Jacob [ Moore ] on for Steve Barger. My first question here is on operating margin, really\naccelerating achievement of that 6% target by a full year. I'm sure that there was some benefit from the\npull forward in the quarter, but my question here is, what are the structural actions do you think that\nmargin performance reflects the most? And really, how much more work is there to be done on those or\nother actions?\nOliver K. Mihm\nExecutive VP & COO\nYes, I'll start and then open up to my colleagues if they have any additional comments they want to add.\nThis is Oliver. Certainly, we have a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency. I'll note that we hit that\nfrom 2 different angles, both in terms of profitability and capital equipment intensity. I'll also note that\ngenerally focusing on continued investments in automation would continue to help us there. By way of\nexample, we deployed a significant warehouse automation project in our Penang campus in fiscal '24 and\nexpect that to propagate more broadly through the organization, and we see both pick rate and efficiency\nimprovements as well as space utilization improvements as a result of that.\nAnd then lastly, I'll just say organizationally, we've aligned around a technology and innovation\norganization as well as driving both pieces of the innovation and the optimization and continuous\nimprovement. And we think all of those things will continue to bear fruit as we drive margin enhancement\nor margin performance through the fiscal year.\nPatrick John Jermain\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. And Jacob, as I look at kind of the quarterly performance we expect in fiscal '25, you're right. For\nQ1, I'm guiding a midpoint of 5.9%. So we are losing some fixed cost leverage on the lower revenue. The\nMarch quarter is burdened by merit increases. So we will see margins coming down at that point before\nwe start improving margins on the back half of this year with productivity improvements Oliver pointed to.\nBut I think what this tells us is we can achieve the target of 5.2% -- I'm sorry, 6.2%, just may not be\nhitting that every quarter.\nUnknown Analyst\nThat's helpful. So maybe just a follow-on to clarify there. Do you think you can hit 6% non-GAAP for the\nfull year? And is there a threshold level of sales growth you need to get there?\nPatrick John Jermain\nExecutive VP & CFO\nI think the sequential revenue growth that we're going to see starting in the second quarter is going to\nbenefit us. Whether we get to 6% for the full year, we'll see. It could be slightly below that. But exiting the\nfiscal '25 is what we want to be hitting that 6.2%.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 13\nPLEXUS CORP. FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 24, 2024\nUnknown Analyst\nGot it. Okay. I got it there. And maybe a last one for me. This was -- actually my first question was on\nthe sustainability of the past 2 months were free cash flow quarters, which you mostly addressed, I think\nit's going to come down some -- But maybe to expand a bit here, could you touch on near-term capital\nallocation priorities? And like what do you see as your highest return opportunities to use that cash going\nforward?\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. I think -- well, I think we've done a great job bringing down debt. So we've only got $50 million\noutstanding under the revolving credit facility. So we do have a new share repurchase authorization of $50\nmillion that we're executing upon. And next month, we're going to be visiting with our Board about other\nopportunities to deploy the significant free cash flow we've generated over the last 2 quarters.\nSo from a priority standpoint, I'd say share repurchase program, maybe some further debt reduction. But\nagain, as we get later in the year with growth, we will see some investment in working capital. And as I\nmentioned, we do have the footprint expansion in Malaysia.\nPatrick John Jermain\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. I'd just add to that, too. I mean, when we think about capital allocation, obviously, one of the first\nthings that comes to mind is supporting growth, and we're expecting a good growth year this year. So\nthat's going to have an impact certainly on our free cash flow as -- compared to fiscal '24.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel.\nMatthew John Sheerin\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\nJust a follow-up on the last question regarding margins and particularly the strength you're seeing in gross\nmargin. You're guiding gross margin down just a little bit on what, 6% or 7% sequential drop. And I'm just\nwondering if in addition to the things you talked about, factory automation, more efficient processes, are\nyou also benefiting from mix? You talked about a higher percentage of engineering services, the defense/\naerospace sector has been a higher percentage of revenue. So could you talk about maybe margin profile\nwithin the different segments and what's going to drive that as we go forward?\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes, I can start, Matt. You're right. I mean, we're probably losing about 50 basis points of fixed cost\nleverage in the first quarter. We're covering that with higher contribution margin. Some of that's coming\nfrom mix of services and customer mix, along with, again, as Oliver touched on further automation and\nproductivity improvements.\nFrom a sector perspective, it's not much of a difference between the sectors. So I wouldn't say any\nadditional weighting to a certain sector is necessarily driving better profitability. It almost comes to within\ncustomers.\nOliver K. Mihm\nExecutive VP & COO\nAnd then I'll add on to that. In terms of mix, rather than hitting that from a sector's perspective, we\nexpect our engineering solutions revenue to pick up as the fiscal year progresses, and that certainly hits a\nhigher margin number than the rest of our operations.\nMatthew John Sheerin\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 14\nPLEXUS CORP. FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 24, 2024\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\nCould you remind us how big that business is?\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nIt's greater than $100 million is kind of the way we framed it. We don't get into a lot of specifics.\nMatthew John Sheerin\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\nBut with very high margins relative to your business, right?\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Anja Soderstrom.\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nAnja? Just that you're really faint.\nAnja Marie Theresa Soderstrom\nSidoti & Company, LLC\nOkay. I'm sorry. So in terms of the Malaysia expansion, to what magnitude do you expect to -- are\nexpanding it? And what kind of products do you support there? And when do you expect the expansion to\nbe completed?\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. So we support all of our market sectors in Malaysia. We have a quite large campus there that\ncurrently consists of 5 different facilities. So this would be our sixth in the Malaysia area. When we think\nabout the new facility, some of the growth we're targeting is around SemiCap and around Healthcare/Life\nSciences in particular. But that's not -- again, within Malaysia, in our Penang campus, we support all of our\nsectors.\nSo regarding completion is -- Yes, we expect to be able to hit some first customer shipments late in the\nfiscal year.\nAnja Marie Theresa Soderstrom\nSidoti & Company, LLC\nOkay. And in terms of the nuclear energy compliance, what led you to get the -- to attain that? And what's\ninvolved in getting that? And what can we expect from you having that?\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. So that was driven by our customer. So we had an award that involved some products that's part of\nthe nuclear energy supply chain. And so the customer came out and audited us to that standard.\nPatrick John Jermain\nExecutive VP & CFO\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 15\nPLEXUS CORP. FQ4 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 24, 2024\nIt's a fairly rigorous standard that supports the -- again, the nuclear energy subsector. And we've already\nhad additional customers that have an interest in the fact that we have this ability.\nOperator\nThere are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Todd Kelsey, Plexus's President\nand Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks.\nTodd P. Kelsey\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. Thank you, Bailey. I'd just like to summarize a bit of our call and the key themes of our call.\nSo first of all, I want to thank our shareholders, investors, analysts and our Plexus team members who\njoined the call this morning. We appreciate your support, as always. Reiterating the key themes of today's\ncall, we're positioned for a solid fiscal 2025, creating additional shareholder value through delivering\nrevenue growth, robust operating margin and sustained free cash flow generation.\nAs we look to fiscal 2025, we anticipate strong aerospace and defense revenue growth given robust end\nmarkets and new program ramps as well as moderate Healthcare/Life Sciences and industrial revenue\ngrowth, aided by share gains in new programs. We've displayed our ability to leverage our focus on\nincreased operational efficiency by achieving our target non-GAAP operating margin goal of greater than\n6% one year earlier than projected. This positions us to continue the strong operational performance of\nrecent quarters in fiscal 2025.\nFinally, we delivered record free cash flow in fiscal 2024, allowing us to reduce debt and generate\nadditional shareholder value. The combination of these factors position Plexus to deliver strong EPS growth\nin fiscal 2025. Thank you again, and have a nice day.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call.

The 2025 Share Repurchase Program was approved by Plexus’ Board of Directors in August 2024 for an additional $50.0 million.\n\n\n\n**Fiscal Year****2024****Information**\n\n  * Generated record free cash flow of $341 million.\n  * Produced ROIC of 11.8%, representing an economic return of 360 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital of 8.2%.\n  * Purchased $55.7 million of our shares at an average price of $103.81 per share.\n\n\n\n_Todd Kelsey, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our team’s focus throughout the fiscal year on delivering customer service excellence while driving expanded operational performance resulted in exceptional fiscal fourth quarter financial results and, we believe, positions us well for fiscal 2025. Fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $1.05 billion, non-GAAP operating margin of 6.2% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.85 all exceeded guidance, while quarterly free cash flow of $194 million was a record and substantially exceeded our projections.”_\n\n_Mr. Kelsey continued, “During fiscal 2024, we continued to create value for our shareholders, our team members, our customers and our communities by advancing our sustainable and responsible business practices. Our team made meaningful progress in reducing our global waste-to-landfill and Scope 1 and 2 emissions, donated more than $1 million through our Plexus Community Foundation and contributed more than 20,000 paid volunteer hours to our local communities. In addition, Plexus was named one of the Top 100 U.S. Internship Programs for 2024 by Yello and Business Friend of the Environment by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce in recognition of our dedication to environmental stewardship, our sustainable business practices and our vision to help create the products that build a better world.”_\n\n_Pat Jermain, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, “Fiscal fourth quarter cash cycle of 64 days was favorable to our expectations and sequentially lower by 19 days as we benefited from increased revenue and continued progress on our working capital initiatives. This level of cash cycle was the best result we delivered in the past four years.”_\n\n_Mr. Jermain continued, “For fiscal 2024, we generated record free cash flow of $341 million, representing more than double our previous record performance and three times our fiscal 2024 net income. With the exceptional free cash flow, we continued to execute our share repurchase programs and reduce our borrowing, ending the year in a net cash position. Cash of approximately $347 million was sequentially higher by $78 million, while borrowing under our revolving credit facility was sequentially lower by $100 million. Finally, while we expect increased investments to support future growth, we anticipate delivering robust fiscal 2025 free cash flow of $50 million to $100 million and deploying excess cash to create additional shareholder value.”_\n\n_Mr. Kelsey added, “We are guiding fiscal first quarter revenue of $960 million to $1.00 billion, non-GAAP operating margin of 5.7% to 6.1% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.52 to $1.67. Although revenue is impacted by the better than anticipated fiscal fourth quarter results, we expect to maintain our strong operating margin performance of recent quarters. We anticipate a return to sequential revenue growth with our fiscal second quarter.”_\n\n_Mr. Kelsey concluded, “We are positioned to continue to create substantial shareholder value in fiscal 2025. We anticipate meaningful fiscal 2025 EPS growth to result from continued robust Aerospace/Defense market sector demand, modest revenue growth in the Healthcare/Life Sciences and Industrial market sectors associated with new program ramps and market share gains, ongoing solid operating margin performance and reduced debt.”_\n\n**Quarterly & Annual Comparison**| Three Months Ended| Twelve Months Ended  \n---|---|---  \n _(in thousands, except EPS)_|  Sep 28, 2024| Jun 29, 2024| Sep 30, 2023| Sep 28, 2024| Sep 30, 2023  \nRevenue| $| 1,050,569| $| 960,751| $| 1,023,947| $| 3,960,827| $| 4,210,305  \nGross profit| 107,912| 94,415| 96,716| 378,530| 394,554  \nOperating income| 53,858| 39,246| 53,333| 167,732| 195,820  \nNet income| 41,221| 25,140| 40,261| 111,815| 139,094  \nDiluted EPS| $| 1.48| $| 0.91| $| 1.44| $| 4.01| $| 4.95  \nGross margin| 10.3| %| 9.8| %| 9.4| %| 9.6| %| 9.4| %  \nOperating margin| 5.1| %| 4.1| %| 5.2| %| 4.2| %| 4.7| %  \nROIC (1)| 11.8| %| 10.4| %| 13.4| %| 11.8| %| 13.4| %  \nEconomic return (1)| 3.6| %| 2.2| %| 4.4| %| 3.6| %| 4.4| %  \n_(1) Refer to Non-GAAP Supplemental Information in Tables 1 and 2 for non-GAAP financial measures discussed and/or disclosed in this release, such as adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, ROIC and economic return._  \n  \n**Business Segment and Market Sector Revenue**\n\nPlexus measures operational performance and allocates resources on a geographic segment basis.

In addition, management uses these and other non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, to provide a better understanding of core performance for purposes of period-to-period comparisons. Plexus believes that these measures are also useful to investors because they provide further insight by eliminating the effect of non-recurring items that are not reflective of continuing operations. For additional information on non-GAAP measures, please refer to the attached Non-GAAP Supplemental Information tables.\n\n**ROIC and Economic Return**\n\nROIC for fiscal year 2024 was 11.8%. Plexus defines ROIC as tax-effected annualized adjusted operating income divided by average invested capital over a five-quarter period for the fiscal year. Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt and operating lease obligations, less cash and cash equivalents. Plexus' weighted average cost of capital for fiscal 2024 was 8.2%. ROIC for fiscal year 2024 less Plexus’ weighted average cost of capital resulted in an economic return of 3.6%.\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nPlexus defines free cash flow as cash flows provided by operations less capital expenditures. For the three months ended September 28, 2024, cash flows provided by operations was $220.1 million, less capital expenditures of $26.3 million, resulting in free cash flow of $193.8 million. For the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, cash flows provided by operations was $436.5 million, less capital expenditures of $95.2 million, resulting in free cash flow of $341.3 million.\n\n**Cash Cycle Days**|  Three Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSep 28, 2024| Jun 29, 2024| Sep 30, 2023  \nDays in Accounts Receivable| 54| 61| 59  \nDays in Contract Assets| 10| 11| 13  \nDays in Inventory| 127| 151| 154  \nDays in Accounts Payable| (59)| (62)| (64)  \nDays in Advanced Payments| (68)| (78)| (75)  \nAnnualized Cash Cycle (1)| 64| 83| 87  \n _(1_|  _)_| _Plexus calculates cash cycle as the sum of days in accounts receivable, days in contract assets and days in inventory, less days in accounts payable and days in advanced payments._  \n  \n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\n**What:** | Plexus Fiscal 2024 Q4 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast  \n---|---  \n**When:** | Thursday, October 24, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time  \n**Where:** | Participants are encouraged to join the live webcast at the investor relations section of the Plexus website, [plexus.com](http://plexus.com).
