Gutman to Chief Wealth Advisory Officer\n\nNovember 13, 2024 at 8:00 AM EST\n\n[Download this Press Release](/node/23461/pdf)\n\nWARSAW, Ind., Nov. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lake City Bank is pleased to announce that it has promoted Carrie A. Gutman, Senior Vice President, Chief Fiduciary Officer, to Chief Wealth Advisory Officer. Gutman, 54, will join the bank’s Management Committee and succeeds Jonathan P. Steiner, Senior Vice President, Chief Wealth Advisory Officer, who will retire on December 6, 2024 after a 40-year career in banking and the last 14 years with Lake City Bank.\n\n“Since joining Lake City Bank, Carrie has quickly become a valued member of the team and has earned the respect of colleagues inside and outside the bank,” said David M. Findlay, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “She will be a great leader of our Wealth Advisory Group team and we look forward to continued growth under her leadership.”\n\nGutman began her banking career in trust administration in 2016. She previously practiced general civil law, including the area of trust and estate law, for 20 years at Hawk Haynie Kammeyer & Smith in Fort Wayne. She has a juris doctor degree from Indiana University’s Robert H. McKinney School of Law and bachelor’s degrees in political science and history from Indiana University.\n\n“Carrie’s background and experience in trust and wealth management are an asset to our clients and the bank’s Wealth Advisory Group,” said Kristin L. Pruitt, President. “We look forward to continued growth and success under her leadership.”\n\nGutman is a member of the Indiana State and Allen County bar associations. She serves as vice president of the Allen County Board of Parks and Recreation. She is a board member of STARBASE of Indiana and treasurer of St. Paul’s Lutheran Church.\n\n“We have a talented Wealth Advisory Group team who diligently work with our clients on their investment objectives and deliver consistent results. I’m excited to lead this great team and build upon the high standard of client success that Jon has set,” said Gutman.\n\n“Over the past 13 years, Jon has done an exceptional job leading our Wealth Advisory Group. He’s brought a disciplined strategic mindset to the team and we’ve experienced great growth in the business,” Findlay said. “Even more importantly, he has consistently demonstrated a thoughtful and caring approach to building relationships with our clients and the communities we serve.”\n\nSteiner joined Lake City Bank in 2010 as a commercial banker and was promoted to his current leadership role on the bank’s Management Committee in 2011. Steiner’s banking career began in 1985 and includes commercial banking and wealth management positions in Indiana and West Michigan community banks.\n\n“Lake City Bank has benefitted from Jon’s leadership and influence,” Pruitt said. “His vision and execution have been a great example for all of us.”\n\nLake City Bank, a $6.6 billion bank headquartered in Warsaw, Indiana, was founded in 1872 and serves Central and Northern Indiana communities with 54 branch offices and a robust digital banking platform. Lake City Bank’s community banking model prioritizes building in-market long-term customer relationships while delivering technology-forward solutions for retail and commercial clients. The bank is the single bank subsidiary of Lakeland Financial Corporation (Nasdaq Global Select/LKFN).

Campus with Building Acquisition to become the Innovation and Technology Center\n\nSeptember 3, 2024 at 8:58 AM EDT\n\n[Download this Press Release](/node/23321/pdf)\n\nWARSAW, Ind., Sept. 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lake City Bank has purchased the 35,600 square foot three story office building at 122 E. Center Street, Warsaw, IN on August 30, 2024. The office building will significantly expand the bank’s Warsaw Campus and support the continued growth of Lake City Bank. The newly acquired building will be substantially renovated and modernized and will be renamed the Lake City Bank Innovation and Technology Center. Lake City Bank has been headquartered in Warsaw since the bank was founded in 1872 and employs 279 employees in the Downtown Warsaw Campus, representing the largest employer in Downtown Warsaw.\n\n“This acquisition adds the 6th building to our Downtown Warsaw campus and represents our continued commitment to the bank’s hometown. Throughout our 152-year history, we’ve been focused on taking care of our clients and communities in every Hoosier Community we serve. Increasingly, our clients are relying upon technology-driven solutions to manage their financial needs. The Lake City Bank Innovation and Technology Center will be home to our Technology Services, Information Security, Application Management and Project Management teams and will provide the bank with significant room to continue our growth well into the future,” said David M. Findlay, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Since 2010, we’ve invested approximately $30 million in our Warsaw facilities and in our Kosciusko County bank offices. We have fully renovated and modernized our entire Warsaw footprint. We’ve proudly taken older buildings and brought them back to life with these major capital investments in our hometown.”\n\nThe building was constructed in 1968 by the United Telephone Company of Indiana to support the region’s telecommunications industry. The third floor has been leased by Lake City Bank since 2012. The first and second floors will be renovated to support additional future growth. The exterior of the building will be updated to reflect the bank’s current brand position. In addition to the added capacity for office space, Lake City Bank will incorporate flexible space options such as a coffee meeting location, a walk up ITM and various meeting rooms with modern conference calling capabilities to enhance communications with other locations in the Lake City Bank footprint.\n\n“For 152 years, Lake City Bank has been growing and investing in the Warsaw community,” said Kristin L. Pruitt, President. “Our investment in this facility is strategic and will support the continued growth of our collaborative teams who deliver innovative products and services to our customers.”\n\nLake City Bank, a $6.6 billion bank headquartered in Warsaw, Indiana, was founded in 1872 and serves Central and Northern Indiana communities with 54 branch offices and a robust digital banking platform. Lake City Bank’s community banking model prioritizes building in-market long-term customer relationships while delivering technology-forward solutions for retail and commercial clients. The bank is the single bank subsidiary of Lakeland Financial Corporation (Nasdaq Global Select/LKFN).
