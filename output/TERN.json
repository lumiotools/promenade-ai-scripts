(“Terns” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: TERN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of small-molecule product candidates to address serious diseases, including oncology and obesity, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided corporate updates.\n\n“Our progress in the third quarter was highlighted by the compelling topline results from our Phase 1 study of TERN-601, which demonstrated class-leading potential as a differentiated, once-daily, oral GLP-1R agonist for the treatment of obesity and supports its rapid advancement into Phase 2 studies,” stated Amy Burroughs, chief executive officer of Terns. “We are looking forward to sharing interim dose escalation data from the Phase 1 CARDINAL trial of TERN-701 as a treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and expect this early look at safety, tolerability and signals of efficacy to reinforce its potential as a best-in-class allosteric for the treatment of CML. Importantly, our successful equity raise underscores the strong support for our promising pipeline of differentiated small molecules, funds Terns through multiple catalysts across our clinical development programs and extends our cash runway into 2028.”\n\n**Recent Pipeline Developments and Anticipated Milestones**\n\n _TERN-701: Oral, allosteric BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)_\n\n  * Interim data from initial dose escalation cohorts in Terns’ ongoing Phase 1 CARDINAL study of TERN-701 in CML expected in early December 2024\n    * CARDINAL is a global, multicenter, open-label, two-part Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of TERN-701 in patients with previously treated CML\n    * The Company expects to share interim dose escalation data from the CARDINAL study, including safety, tolerability and early signals of efficacy\n  * In August, Terns hosted a TERN-701 [webinar event](https://ir.ternspharma.com/events/event-details/tern-701-interpreting-early-datasets-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-cml) focused on interpreting early datasets in CML\n\n\n\n _TERN-601: Oral, small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist for obesity_\n\n  * Terns plans to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in early second quarter of 2025 with initial 12-week data expected in the second half of 2025\n    * The trial will begin with a 12-week portion to optimize dose titration and inform subsequent cohorts\n  * In September, Terns announced positive safety and 28-day weight loss [data](https://ir.ternspharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/terns-pharmaceuticals-announces-positive-phase-1-clinical-trial) from the Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial of TERN-601 in obese and overweight participants\n    * The results showed TERN-601 was well tolerated and demonstrated dose-dependent, statistically significant mean weight loss up to 5.5% (4.9% placebo adjusted) over 28 days\n    * 67% of study participants lost 5% or more of their baseline body weight at the highest dose of 740 mg once-daily (QD)\n    * TERN-601 exhibited distinct properties for an oral GLP-1R agonist\n      * Low solubility and high gut permeability allowed for prolonged absorption and sustained target coverage and a flat PK curve, while high drug levels in the gut wall may lead to robust GLP-1R activation in the gut triggering satiety centers in the brain\n      * Low free fraction in circulation, combined with the flat PK curve, may contribute to TERN-601's tolerability profile at higher target doses than other oral GLP-1R agonists\n    * TERN-601 was well-tolerated with no treatment-related dose interruptions, reductions, or discontinuations even with rapid dose titration \n\n\n\n _TERN-501: Oral, thyroid hormone receptor-beta (THR-β) agonist_\n\n  * In June, Terns presented new preclinical data at the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 84th Scientific Sessions supporting TERN-501 in combination with a GLP-1 receptor agonist for obesity\n    * Preclinical findings demonstrated TERN-501 in combination with semaglutide significantly enhanced weight loss and showed proportionally greater loss of fat mass relative to lean mass compared to semaglutide alone\n    * Supports the potential for TERN-501 as a combination partner for injectable and oral GLP-1 agonists for use in obesity and other metabolic disorders\n    * The full poster is available on Terns’ scientific publications [website](https://www.ternspharma.com/scientific-publications)\n  * Terns continues to evaluate opportunities for TERN-501 in metabolic diseases \n\n\n\n _TERN-800 Series: Oral, small-molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) modulators_\n\n  * Discovery efforts are ongoing for small molecule GIPR modulators for obesity, which have the potential for combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as TERN-601\n  * Terns is prioritizing its discovery efforts on nominating a GIPR antagonist development candidate based on in-house discoveries and growing scientific rationale supporting the potential of GLP-1 agonist/GIPR antagonist combinations for obesity\n\n\n\n**Corporate Updates**\n\n  * In September, Terns completed an upsized public offering of 14,064,048 shares of its common stock and 2,380,952 pre-funded warrants, generating gross proceeds of approximately $172.7 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, which extends the Company’s cash runway into 2028\n  * In July, Terns appointed Elona Kogan as Chief Legal Officer\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $372.8 million, as compared with $263.4 million as of December 31, 2023.
