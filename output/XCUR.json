Announces Proposed Settlement of Securities Class Action Litigation\n\n09/09/2024\n\nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Exicure, Inc. (Nasdaq: XCUR, the “Company”) announced today that it has entered into an agreement with plaintiffs to settle Colwell v. Exicure, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-CV-06637, a previously disclosed securities class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the “Court”). The settlement is subject to Court approval, and plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement with the Court on September 6, 2024. \n\nThe settlement does not constitute any admission by the Company of any liability or wrongdoing. Nonetheless, the Company believes it is beneficial to resolve the case as further litigation would be burdensome and protracted. \n\n**About Exicure**\n\nExicure, Inc. has historically been an early-stage biotechnology company focused on developing nucleic acid therapies targeting ribonucleic acid against validated targets. Following its recent restructuring and suspension of clinical and development activities, the Company is exploring strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value, both with respect to its historical biotechnology assets and more broadly.

Enters into Purchase Agreements for $1.3 Million and $8.7 Million Equity Financing and Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\n11/14/2024\n\nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Exicure, Inc. (Nasdaq: XCUR, the \"Company\") has historically been an early-stage biotechnology company focused on developing nucleic acid therapies targeting ribonucleic acid against validated targets. In September 2022, the Company announced a significant reduction in force, suspension of preclinical activities and halting of all research and development, and that the Company was exploring strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. \n\n** Equity Financing **\n\nIn an agreement dated November 6, 2024 and executed on November 12, 2024, the Company agreed to sell and issue to HiTron Systems Inc. (“HiTron”) 433,333 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, for $1.3 million, at a purchase price of $3.00 per share. The closing of this transaction is expected to occur within 10 days from its execution. On November 13, 2024, in a subsequent agreement, the Company agreed to sell and issue to HiTron 2,900,000 additional shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, for $8.7 million, at a purchase price of $3.00 per share. The closing of the investment pursuant to this subsequent agreement is conditioned on stockholder approval, among other customary conditions. \n\nUpon closing of the initial $1.3 million investment, HiTron will have the right to appoint two nominees to the Company’s board of directors, subject to certain conditions. Upon closing of the subsequent $8.7 million investment, HiTron will have the right to appoint additional nominees in proportion to its equity interest, subject to certain conditions. \n\n** Request for Subsequent Extension to Nasdaq Hearings Panel **\n\nAs previously disclosed, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel granted an extension through November 14, 2024 to continue the Company’s listing subject to the Company evidencing compliance with all applicable criteria for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not meet the continued listing requirement related to stockholders’ equity, primarily due to the litigation accrual described below. However, the Company believes it will be in pro forma compliance with the stockholders’ equity requirement once the $1.3 million sale to HiTron closes. Therefore, the Company has requested an additional extension through December 17, 2024. We cannot provide any assurance as to whether the Panel will grant the extension or, if granted, whether we can adequately demonstrate to the Panel’s satisfaction that we have regained, and will be able to maintain, compliance with the continued listing standards in order to avoid delisting. \n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results **\n\n**_Cash Position_ : ** Cash and cash equivalents were $0.3 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to $0.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to continue to fund operations and additional funding is needed in the very near term. \n\n**_General and Administrative (G &A) Expense_ : ** General and administrative expenses were $1.46 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $2.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in G&A expense of $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was mostly due to lower expenses as a result of reduced operations and higher costs in 2023 resulting from the separation costs of former employees. \n\n**_Litigation legal expense_ : ** The increase of $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to accruals recorded for the amount of the unsatisfied self insured retainer and legal defense costs related to the securities litigation lawsuit. \n\n**_Other Income:_ ** The Company will receive gross proceeds of $1.5 million from closing the sale of certain assets pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Purchaser acquired the Company’s historical biotechnology intellectual property and other assets and include spherical nucleic acid-related technology, research and development programs, and clinical assets. \n\n**_Net Loss:_ ** The Company had a net loss of $1.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of $5.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss of $4.2 million was primarily driven by the $1.5 million of revenue from the Asset Purchase Agreement, the $2 million loss incurred in 2023 from the write down of its investment in convertible bonds, and the reduction of payroll and operating costs due to reduced operations. \n\n**_Going Concern:_ ** Management believes that the Company’s existing cash and cash equivalents is not sufficient to continue to fund operations. The Company has already engaged in significant cost reductions, so our ability to further cut costs and extend the Company’s operating runway is limited. As a result, substantial additional financing is needed in very near term to pay expenses, fund the ongoing exploration of strategic alternatives and pursue any alternatives that may be identified. The Company needs to raise capital to fund its operations. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available and, if available, can be obtained on acceptable terms. \n\n**About Exicure**\n\nExicure, Inc. has historically been an early-stage biotechnology company focused on developing nucleic acid therapies targeting ribonucleic acid against validated targets.

Receives Extension from Nasdaq Hearings Panel\n\n09/18/2024\n\nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Exicure, Inc. (“Exicure” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: XCUR), announced today that on September 17, 2024, the Company received notice that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (“Panel”) granted an extension to continue the Company’s listing subject to the Company evidencing compliance with all applicable criteria for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market by November 14, 2024. The Company is diligently working to timely satisfy the terms of the Panel’s requests and to ensure the Company’s continued listing on Nasdaq. \n\nAs previously announced, the Company has regained compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirement and exchanged approximately $1,000,000 of indebtedness for equity at a conversion price of $3.00 per share. \n\n**About Exicure**\n\nExicure, Inc. has historically been an early-stage biotechnology company focused on developing nucleic acid therapies targeting ribonucleic acid against validated targets.

There can be no assurance regarding our ability to comply with the Panel’s decision and the applicable listing criteria by the deadline or thereafter. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual outcomes to differ materially from the outcomes expressed or implied by this report. Such risks include, among others, the possibility we will not be able to cure existing listing deficiencies, the possibility of additional deficiencies, the risk that the Company may not adequately comply with the terms of the Panel’s decision, and the risk that Nasdaq will ultimately delist the Company's common stock.

All statements other than\nstatements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking\nstatements by terminology such as “may,” “could,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,”, “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,” “predict,”\n“seek,” “contemplate,” “project,” “continue,” “potential,” “ongoing” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking\nstatements also include the assumptions underlying or relating to such statements.\nAlthough we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, such expectations or any of the\nforward-looking statements may prove to be incorrect and actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in the forward-looking\nstatements. Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties,\nincluding, but not limited to, the risk factors described in the “Risk Factor Summary” below and set forth in Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors” below and for the\nreasons described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. All forward-looking statements and reasons why results may differ included in this report\nare made as of the date hereof and we do not intend to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. These forward-looking statements\ninclude, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following:\n• substantial uncertainties regarding our exploration of strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value, including whether we are able to identify\npotential partners and consummate transactions, in a timely manner or at all, whether we would be able to obtain sufficient funding to complete this\nprocess and whether any such transactions would generate value for stockholders;\n• our ability to generate any meaningful value from sales, out-licensing or other transactions involving our historical assets;\n• our ability to raise the substantial additional capital that is needed within the next few months to fund our operations and our pursuit of strategic\nalternatives, particularly given our current lack of a revenue source or committed financing and the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern;\n• our ability to correct deficiencies and to remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”), including the ability to maintain minimum\nstockholders’ equity and stock price, and comply with applicable governance requirements, for continued listing on Nasdaq;\n• any strategic plan or alternative that we may identify and pursue may involve unexpected costs, liabilities and/or delays and may not deliver\nanticipated benefits to our stockholders;\n• our estimates of expenses, use of cash, timing of future cash needs, ongoing losses and capital requirements, including our expectations relating to our\nneeds for additional financing and the timing thereof may prove to be inaccurate;\n• uncertainty about reaction from investors and potential business partners to our recent change of control and board composition and the future\ndirection of the Company, and the ability of our controlling stockholder and new board members to earn the confidence of investors and potential\npartners despite limited experience with U.S. public companies, and how these factors may impact our ability to obtain funding and execute any\nstrategic alternatives that we may identify;\n• potential turnover of senior management in the near term, and any inability to attract and retain qualified management and other key personnel, could\ncreate significant continuity risk and impair our ability to raise capital and execute on our exploration of strategic alternatives;\n3\nTable of Contents\n• our ability to comply with all applicable laws, which may be particularly challenging given the recent turnover in our board, potential turnover in\nmanagement, significant reductions in force, limited resources and the potential to enter into new business areas with which we have no past\nexperience;\n• our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our technologies and our ability to operate our business without infringing the\nintellectual property rights of others;\n• the impact of worsening macroeconomic conditions, including rising global inflation, actions taken by central banks to counter inflation, capital\nmarket and bank instability, exchange rate fluctuations, supply chain disruptions and energy and fuel prices;\n• the impact of government laws and regulations as well as developments relating to our competitors or our industry; and\n• other factors that may impact our financial results and condition and our ongoing strategic efforts.\nThese statements relate to future events or our future operational or financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other\nfactors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements\nexpressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, among\nother things, those listed in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nAny forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflects our current view with respect to future events and is subject to these and\nother risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our business, results of operations, industry and future growth. Given these uncertainties, you should not\nplace undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance. You should read this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference herein and have filed with the SEC as exhibits thereto completely and with the understanding that\nour actual future results may be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Except as required by\nlaw, we assume no, and specifically decline any, obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information\nbecomes available in the future.\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also contains or may contain estimates, projections and other information concerning our industry, our business and\nthe markets for certain therapeutics, including data regarding the estimated size of those markets, their projected growth rates and the incidence of certain\nmedical conditions. Information that is based on estimates, forecasts, projections or similar methodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties and actual\nevents or circumstances may differ materially from events and circumstances reflected in this information. Unless otherwise expressly stated, we obtained these\nindustry, business, market and other data from reports, research surveys, studies and similar data prepared by third parties, industry, medical and general\npublications, government data and similar sources. In some cases, we do not expressly refer to the sources from which these data are derived.\nExcept where the context otherwise requires, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the “Company,” “Exicure,” “we,” “us” and “our” refers to Exicure,\nInc., a Delaware corporation, and, where appropriate, our subsidiary.\n4\nTable of Contents\nSUMMARY RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in common stock involves numerous risks, including the risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nBelow are some of these risks, any one of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n• Our exploration of strategic alternatives may not be successful.\n• We need to obtain substantial funding in the near term in order to continue operations and our exploration of strategic alternatives.\n• Our controlling stockholder, executive officers and members of our board, have limited experience controlling or governing a public company in the\nUnited States.\n• Turnover of senior management, and any inability to attract and retain qualified management and other key personnel, could impair our ability to\nimplement our business plan.\n• Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.\n• We currently do not comply with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements. Our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq, which could negatively\nimpact the price of our common stock, liquidity and our ability to access the capital markets.\n• We have a history of losses. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain\nprofitability, which could result in a decline in the market value of our common stock.\n• Our internal computer systems, or those of contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption\nof our business operations.\n• Our information technology systems could face disruptions that could adversely affect our business.\n• Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or unauthorized or inappropriate use of or access to our information\ntechnology systems.\n• Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social\nand governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\n• Our current operations are concentrated in one location and any events affecting this location may have material adverse consequences.\n• The investment of our cash, cash equivalents and fixed income marketable securities is subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity\nof these investments.\n• If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\n• We currently license patent rights from Northwestern University. If Northwestern University does not properly or successfully obtain, maintain or\nenforce the patents underlying such licenses, or if they retain or license to others any competing rights, our competitive position and business\nprospects may be adversely affected.\n• Our licensors, or any current or future strategic partners, may become subject to third-party claims or litigation alleging infringement of patents or\nother proprietary rights or seeking to invalidate patents or other proprietary rights, and we may need to resort to litigation to protect or enforce our\npatents or other proprietary rights, all of which could be costly, time consuming, or put our patents and other proprietary rights at risk.\n• We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\n• If we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, collaboration or other agreements, we may be required to pay damages and could lose\nintellectual property rights that are necessary for developing and protecting our therapeutic candidates or we could lose certain rights to grant\nsublicenses.\n• Our status as a “controlled company” could make our Common Stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm the trading price of our\nCommon Stock.\n• The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or\nabove the price you paid for them.\n5\nTable of Contents\n• Raising additional funds by issuing securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders and raising funds through lending and licensing\narrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\n• We are an “emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will\nmake our common stock less attractive to investors.\n• Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware could make an acquisition of us\nmore difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.\n• Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for\ncertain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’’ ability to obtain a favorable\njudicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\n• Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\n• FINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock due to our low stock price.\n• If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our\nstock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\n6\nTable of Contents\nPART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\nDescription of Business\nExicure, Inc. has historically been an early-stage biotechnology company focused on developing nucleic acid therapies targeting ribonucleic acid against\nvalidated targets. In September 2022, the Company announced a significant reduction in force, suspension of preclinical activities and halting of all research\nand development, and that the Company was exploring strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. While the foregoing efforts are continuing, the\nCompany does not expect they will generate significant value for stockholders, at least in the near term. Therefore, the Company is engaging in a broader\nexploration of strategic alternatives. This effort involves exploring growth through transactions with potential partners that see opportunity in joining an\nexisting, publicly-traded organization. The Company is exploring transactions in industries unrelated to its historical operations.\nThroughout these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the terms the “Company,” and “Exicure” refer to Exicure, Inc. and where\nappropriate, its wholly owned subsidiary, Exicure Operating Company. Exicure Operating Company holds all material assets and conducts all business\nactivities and operations of Exicure, Inc.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and for the three and six months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2022, have been presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Exicure and its wholly owned subsidiary, Exicure\nOperating Company. All intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation.\nGoing Concern\nAt each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company is required to make certain additional\ndisclosures if it concludes substantial doubt exists and it is not alleviated by the Company’s plans or when its plans alleviate substantial doubt about the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going\nconcern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. As of June 30, 2023, the Company has generated an accumulated deficit\nof $201,657 since inception and expects to incur significant expenses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. As of June 30, 2023, the Company’s\ncash, and cash equivalents were $2,335. Management believes that, given the Company’s current cash position, operating plans and forecasted negative cash\nflows from operating activities over the next twelve months, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one\nyear after the date these financial statements are issued. Substantial additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations.\nManagement believes that the Company’s existing cash and cash equivalents will fund its operating expenses into the fourth quarter of 2023. However, this\nestimate is based on assumptions about how the Company can limit spending that may prove to be wrong. It is very difficult to project the Company’s current\ncash burn rate given the transitional status of the Company and this estimate may prove inaccurate. Depending on the direction of the\n14\nTable of Contents\nEXICURE, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nCompany’s review of strategic alternatives, the Company may use available resources sooner than management currently expects. The Company has already\nengaged in significant cost reductions, so our ability to further cut costs and extend the Company’s operating runway is limited. As a result, substantial\nadditional financing will be needed by the Company within the next few months to pay expenses, fund the ongoing exploration of strategic alternatives and\npursue any alternatives that may be identified. The Company seeks to raise capital in the third quarter of 2023 to fund its operations through 2024. There can be\nno assurance that such additional financing will be available and, if available, can be obtained on acceptable terms.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared as though the Company will continue as a going concern,\nwhich contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any\nadjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary\nshould the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThe accompanying interim condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023, the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations for the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the interim condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022, the interim condensed consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023\nand 2022, and the interim condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 are unaudited. The interim\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited financial statements; and in the opinion of\nmanagement, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the Company’s financial position as\nof June 30, 2023, the results of its operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its cash flows for the six months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2022. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes related to the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 are\nunaudited. The results for the six months ended June 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2023, or\nany other interim periods, or any future year or period.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on certain assumptions which it believes are reasonable in the circumstances and\nwhile actual results could differ from those estimates, management does not believe that any change in those assumptions in the near term would have a\nsignificant effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Actual results in future periods could differ from those estimates.\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included in\nthe in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)\non March 27, 2023, as amended by Amendment No. 1 filed with the SEC on May 1, 2023 (the “Annual Report”). Since the date of those audited consolidated\nfinancial statements, there have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies.\n15\nTable of Contents\nEXICURE, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nSecurities\nIn May 2023, the Company entered into two subscription agreements purchase non-guaranteed private placement convertible bonds (the “Bonds”) for a\nsubscription amount of $1 million each. The Bonds mature in May 2026 and the yield to maturity is 4.5% per annum. The Company will also have the put\noption to redeem part or the entire principal amount of the Bonds on the first anniversary after the issue date and every three months thereafter before the\nmaturity date. The conversion ratio will be one hundred percent (100%) of the Bond’s face value\nThese securities are designated by the Company as “held-to-maturity” (HTM) at the point of investment. As of June 30, 2023, these marketable securities\nheld by the Company had remaining contractual maturities of more than one year. HTM securities are valued on an amortized cost basis and reviewed to\ndetermine if an allowance for credit losses should be recorded in the statements of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 is a new standard\nintended to improve reporting requirements specific to loans, receivables and other financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 requires that credit losses on financial\nassets measured at amortized cost be determined using an expected loss model, instead of the current incurred loss model, and requires that credit losses related\nto available-for-sale and HTM debt securities be recorded through an allowance for credit losses and limited to the amount by which carrying value exceeds\nfair value. ASU 2016-13 also requires enhanced disclosure of credit risk associated with financial assets. The effective date of ASU 2016-13 was deferred by\nASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842)—Effective Dates to the\nannual period beginning after December 15, 2022 for companies that (i) meet the definition of an SEC filer and (ii) are eligible as “smaller reporting\ncompanies” as such term is defined by the SEC, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU in January 2023, there was no material impact\non the consolidated financial statements.\n3.

Awards that may be awarded under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan include non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation\nrights, bonus shares, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and cash-based awards. The number of shares of common stock reserved for\nissuance under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan automatically increases on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2020, by the lesser of (i) 153,333\nshares, (ii) 5% of the total number of shares of its capital stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or (iii) a lesser number of shares\ndetermined by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”). No future awards will be made under the 2015 Plan upon the\neffectiveness of the 2017 Plan. On January 1, 2023, pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Plan, the number of awards that are reserved and may be awarded under\nthe 2017 Plan was automatically increased by 153,333 awards.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the aggregate number of equity awards available for grant under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan was 574,302.\nAwards granted under the 2017 Plan are contingent on the participants’ continued employment or provision of non-employee services and are subject to\nforfeiture if employment or continued service terminates for any reason. The initial award granted to an employee or consultant generally vests 25% on the first\n12-month anniversary of the grant date and vests 1/48th monthly thereafter until fully vested at the end of 48 months. Subsequent awards granted to employees\nor consultants generally vest 1/48th monthly until fully vested at the end of 48 months. The initial stock option grant to a non-employee director vests 1/36th\nmonthly until fully vested at the end of 36 months. Subsequent stock option grants to a non-employee director vests 1/12th monthly until fully vested at the end\nof 12 months. The term of common stock option grants is 10 years unless terminated earlier as described above.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) was adopted by the Board in September 2017 and approved by the Company’s stockholders in\nSeptember 2017. Through the ESPP, eligible employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 15% of their compensation to purchase common stock. The\nmaximum number of shares that an employee may purchase on any exercise date in an offer period will be the smaller of (i) 250 shares or (ii) such number of\nshares as has a fair market value (determined as of the offering date for such offer period) equal to $25,000 within one calendar year minus the fair market\nvalue of any other shares of common stock that are attributed to such calendar year. The purchase price per share at each purchase date is equal to 85% of the\nlower of (i) the closing market price per share of Exicure common stock on the employee’s offering date or (ii) the closing market price per share of Exicure\ncommon stock on the exercise date.\nThe ESPP provides that the number of shares reserved and available for issuance will automatically increase each January 1, beginning on January 1, 2018\nand each January 1 thereafter through January 1, 2027, by the least of (i) 10,000 shares; (ii) 0.3% of the outstanding shares of common stock on the last day of\nthe immediately preceding calendar year; or (iii) a lesser number of shares determined by the Board. On January 1, 2023, the number of shares of common\nstock available for issuance under the ESPP increased by 10,000 shares. As of June 30, 2023, there were 51,971 shares available for issuance under the ESPP.\n22\nTable of Contents\nEXICURE, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nEquity-based compensation expense is classified in the statements of operations as follows:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nResearch and development expense $ 8 $ 171 $ 162 $ 330\nGeneral and administrative expense 961 336 1,115 519\n$ 969 $ 507 $ 1,277 $ 849\nUnamortized equity-based compensation expense at June 30, 2023 was $532, which is expected to be amortized over a weighted-average period of 1.8\nyears.\nThe Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of common stock option grants. The Black-Scholes option-\npricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The model also\nrequires the input of highly subjective assumptions. The following table presents the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for stock\noptions granted during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:\nSix Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2023 2022\nExpected term 5.8 to 5.8 years 5.3 to 6.1 years\n3.83% to 3.83%; weighted avg. 2.86% to 3.56%; weighted avg.\nRisk-free interest rate 3.83% 2.91%\n100.9% to 100.9%; weighted 95.2% to 95.8%; weighted avg.\nExpected volatility avg. 100.9% 95.2%\nForfeiture rate 5 % 5 %\nExpected dividend yield — % — %\nThe expected term is based upon the “simplified method” as described in Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14.D.2. Currently, the Company does not have\nsufficient experience to provide a reasonable estimate of an expected term of its common stock options. The Company will continue to use the “simplified\nmethod” until there is sufficient experience to provide a more reasonable estimate in conformance with ASC 718-10-30-25 through 30-26. The risk-free interest\nrate assumptions were based on the U.S. Treasury bond rate appropriate for the expected term in effect at the time of grant. For stock options granted after\nDecember 31, 2021, the expected volatility is based on the volatility of shares of the Company. For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2022, the expected\nvolatility is based on calculated enterprise value volatilities for publicly traded companies in the same industry and general stage of development. The\nestimated forfeiture rates were based on historical experience for similar classes of employees. The dividend yield was based on expected dividends at the time\nof grant.\nThe fair value of the underlying common stock and the exercise price for the common stock options granted during the six months ended June 30, 2023\nand 2022 are summarized in the table below.\nFair Value of Underlying Common Exercise Price of Common Stock\nCommon Stock Options Granted During Period Ended: Stock Option\n$1.58; $1.58;\nSix months ended June 30, 2023 weighted avg. $1.58 weighted avg. $1.58\n$3.46 to $5.51; $3.46 to $5.51;\nSix months ended June 30, 2022 weighted avg. $4.56 weighted avg. $4.56\n23\nTable of Contents\nEXICURE, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of common stock options granted in the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $1.26 per common stock option.\nA summary of common stock option activity as of the periods indicated is as follows:\nWeighted-Average\nWeighted-Average Remaining Contractual Aggregate Intrinsic Value\nOptions Exercise Price (1) Term (years) (thousands)\nOutstanding - December 31, 2022 222,833 $ 4.74 7.5 $ —\nGranted 10,000 1.58\nExercised — —\nForfeited (65,927) 5.40\nOutstanding - June 30, 2023 166,906 $ 4.28 6.1 $ —\nExercisable - June 30, 2023 161,763 $ 4.26 6.1 $ —\nVested and Expected to Vest -\nJune 30, 2023 166,671 $ 4.28 6.1 $ —\n(1) On March 24, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors unanimously approved the repricing of all outstanding and unexercised stock options granted\nunder our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and 2017 Equity Incentive Plan and held by its current employees, executive officers, and directors. Effective\nApril 1, 2022, the exercise price of the eligible stock options was reduced to $5.51, the closing price of our common stock on April 1, 2022.

At vesting, each outstanding restricted\nstock unit will be exchanged for one share of the Company’s common stock. Restricted stock units generally vest evenly on a quarterly basis over a period of 4\nyears in exchange for continued service provided by the restricted stock unit recipient during that vesting period.\nA summary of performance-based restricted stock unit activity of the periods indicated is as follows:\nPerformance-Based Weighted-Average Grant\nRestricted Stock Units Date Fair Value\nUnvested balance - December 31, 2022 97,643 $ 3.45\nGranted — —\nSettled (97,643) 1.91\nUnvested balance - June 30, 2023 — $ —\nThe grant date fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is based on the Company’s closing stock price at the date of grant. At vesting, each\noutstanding restricted stock unit will be exchanged for one share of the Company’s common stock. Certain performance metrics must be met by the\nperformance measurement date in 2023 in order for the performance-based restricted stock units granted during 2022 to vest as follows: one-third on May 16,\n2023, one-third on May 16, 2024, and one-third on May 16, 2025, in exchange for continued service provided by the performance-based restricted stock unit\nrecipient during that vesting period.\n8. Income Taxes\nThe Company incurred a pretax loss in each of the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, which consists entirely of loss in the United States and\nresulted in no provision for income tax expense during the periods then ended. The effective tax rate is 0% in each of the six months ended June 30, 2023 and\n2022 because the Company has generated tax losses and has provided a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.\n9. Loss Per Common Share\nBasic loss per common share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.\nDiluted loss per common share is calculated using the treasury share method by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities that were outstanding.\nPotentially dilutive options, restricted stock units and warrants to purchase common stock that were outstanding during the periods presented were excluded\nfrom the diluted loss per share calculation for the periods presented because such shares had an anti-dilutive effect due to the net loss reported in those periods.\nTherefore, basic and diluted loss per common share is the same for each of the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nThe following is the computation of loss per common share for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nNet loss $ (5,764) $ (7,470) $ (10,171) $ (15,818)\nWeighted-average basic and diluted common shares\noutstanding 8,432,394 4,503,983 7,366,594 4,268,955\nLoss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.68) $ (1.66) $ (1.38) $ (3.71)\n25\nTable of Contents\nEXICURE, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nThe outstanding securities presented below were excluded from the calculation of loss per common share, for the periods presented, because such\nsecurities would have been anti-dilutive due to the Company’s loss per share during that period:\nAs of June 30,\n2023 2022\nOptions to purchase common stock 166,906 317,262\nRestricted stock units 7,700 49,411\nPerformance stock units — 97,643\nWarrants to purchase common stock 50,110 576,261\n10. Fair Value Measurements\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value, as follows:\nLevel 1 Inputs - unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date; Level 2\nInputs - other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full\nterm of the asset or liability; and Level 3 Inputs - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are\nnot available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2023 are as follows:\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 1,148 $ 1,148 $ — $ —\nTotal financial assets $ 1,148 $ 1,148 $ — $ —\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 are as follows:\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 1,612 $ 1,612 $ — $ —\nTotal financial assets $ 1,612 $ 1,612 $ — $ —\nThe Company uses the market approach and Level 1 and Level 2 inputs to value its cash equivalents and Level 2 inputs to value its short-term investments.\nThe Company uses the market approach and Level 3 inputs to value its liabilities.

Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nOn December 13, 2021, Mark Colwell filed a putative securities class action lawsuit against the Company, David A. Giljohann and Brian C. Bock in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, captioned Colwell v. Exicure, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-0663. On February 4, 2021, plaintiff\nfiled an amended putative securities class action complaint. On March 20, 2023, the court entered an order appointing James Mathew as lead plaintiff and\nBleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP as lead counsel in the action pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. On May 26, 2023, lead plaintiff\nfiled a second amended complaint against the Company, Dr. Giljohann, Mr. Bock, and Grant Corbett. The second amended complaint alleges that Dr.\nGiljohann, Mr. Bock, and Dr. Corbett made materially false and/or misleading statements related to the Company’s clinical programs purportedly causing\nlosses to investors who acquired Company securities between January 7, 2021 and December 10, 2021. The second amended complaint does not quantify any\nalleged damages but, in addition to attorneys’ fees and costs, lead plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of himself and others who acquired the\nCompany’s stock during the putative class period at allegedly inflated prices and purportedly suffered financial harm as a result. The Company intends to move\nto dismiss the second amended complaint.\nOn March 1, 2022, Kapil Puri filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit on behalf of the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District\nof Illinois, against Dr. Giljohann and Mr. Bock, Jeffrey L. Cleland, Elizabeth Garofalo, Bosun Hau, Bali Muralidhar, Andrew Sassine, Matthias Schroff, James\nSulat and Timothy Walbert, captioned Puri v. Giljohann, et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-01083. On March 8, 2022, Yixin Sim filed a similar shareholder derivative\nlawsuit in the same court against the same individuals, captioned Sim v. Giljohann, et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-01217. On April 25, 2022, Stourbridge Investments\nLLC filed a similar shareholder derivative lawsuit against the same individuals in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned\nStourbridge Investments LLC v. Exicure, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00526. Based on similar factual allegations presented in the Colwell complaint,\ndescribed above, the Puri, Sim, and Stourbridge complaints (collectively, the “Derivative Complaints”) allege that the defendants caused the Company to issue\nfalse and/or misleading statements in the proxy statement for its 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders regarding risk oversight, code of conduct, clinical\nprogram and compensation matters, among other things, in violation of federal securities law, and committed breaches of fiduciary duties. The Derivative\nComplaints also assert that Dr. Giljohann and Mr. Bock are liable for contribution under the federal securities laws. The Puri and Stourbridge complaints\nfurther assert state law claims for unjust enrichment, and the Puri complaint additionally asserts state law claims for abuse of control, gross mismanagement\nand corporate waste. The plaintiffs do not quantify any alleged damages in the Derivative Complaints, but seek restitution for damages to the Company,\nattorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses, as well as an order directing that certain proposals for strengthening board oversight be put to a vote of the Company’s\nshareholders.\nOn March 18, 2022, James McNabb, through counsel, sent a written demand to the Company (the “Demand Letter”) demanding that the Board of\nDirectors investigate certain allegations and commence proceedings on the Company’s behalf against certain of the Company’s current officers and directors\nfor alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and corporate waste. All of the Derivative Cases have been stayed pending a decision on any motion to dismiss that\nmay be filed in the Colwell case. In addition, the Stourbridge case has been administratively closed pending the decision on motion to dismiss that may be filed\nin the Colwell case. Further, pursuant to agreement, the Demand Letter is being held in abeyance and any related statute of limitations tolled pending such\nmotion and decision.\nIn June 2023, a director of the Company designated by CBI USA served a demand on the Company to access certain books and records pursuant to Section\n220(d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Company served its response and is working with the director to resolve this demand amicably and in\naccordance with the Company’s obligations under Delaware law.\n27\nTable of Contents\nEXICURE, INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nNorthwestern University License Agreements\nOn December 12, 2011, (1) AuraSense, LLC, the Company’s former parent, assigned to the Company all of its worldwide rights and interests under\nAuraSense, LLC’s 2009 license agreement with Northwestern University (“NU”) in the field of the use of nanoparticles, nanotechnology, microtechnology or\nnanomaterial-based constructs as therapeutics or accompanying therapeutics as a means of delivery, but expressly excluding diagnostics (the “assigned field”);\n(2) in accordance with the terms and conditions of this assignment, the Company assumed all liabilities and obligations of AuraSense, LLC as set forth in its\nlicense agreement in the assigned field; and (3) in order to secure this assignment and the patent rights from NU, the Company agreed (i) to pay NU an annual\nlicense fee, which may be credited against any royalties due to NU in the same year, (ii) to reimburse NU for expenses associated with the prosecution and\nmaintenance of the license patent rights, (iii) to pay NU royalties based on any net revenue generated by the Company’s sale or transfer of any licensed\nproduct, (iv) to pay NU, in the event the Company grants a sublicense under the licensed patent rights, the greater of a percentage of all sublicensee royalties or\na percentage of any net revenue generated by a sublicensee’s sale or transfer of any licensed product, and (v) to pay NU a percentage of all other sublicense\npayments received by the Company. In August 2015, the Company entered into a restated license agreement with NU (the “Restated License Agreement”). In\nFebruary 2016, the Company obtained exclusive license as to NU’s rights in certain SNA technology it jointly owns with NU (the “Co-owned Technology\nLicense”). The Company’s license to NU’s rights is limited to the assigned field, however the Company has no such limitation as to its own rights in this jointly\nowned technology. The Company’s rights and obligations in the Co-owned Technology License agreement is substantially the same as in the Restated License\nAgreement from August 2015 (collectively referred to as “the Northwestern University License Agreements”). As of June 30, 2023, the Company has paid to\nNU an aggregate of $11,550 in consideration of each of the obligations described above.\nOn August 3, 2023, the company received a notice letter (the “Letter”) from counsel for NU alleging the Company breached the Northwestern University\nLicense Agreements. The Letter alleges that a lack of development required under the Northwestern University License Agreements is a breach. The Company\nis currently evaluating the letter and expects to have discussions with NU regarding the matters set forth in the Letter. At this time, the Company cannot\ndetermine the outcome of any such discussions.\nLeases\nRefer to Note 4, Leases, for a discussion of the commitments associated with the Company’s lease agreements.\n12. Related-Party Transactions\nPursuant to a Consulting Agreement, effective as of September 25, 2022, between the Company and Alta Companies LTD (“Alta”), the Company paid Alta\n$218 on February 27, 2023 for a consulting fee earned as a result of the September 2022 PIPE closing. Paul Kang, a director of the Company since February\n2023, is the President of Alta.\n28\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto\nincluded in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial information and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on March 27, 2023, as amended by Amendment\nNo. 1 filed with the SEC on May 1, 2023 (the “Annual Report”). This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning\nof Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the\nExchange Act, that involve significant risks and uncertainties. Our actual results, performance or experience could differ materially from what is indicated by\nany forward-looking statement due to various important factors, risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors including, but not limited to, those\nidentified in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and those set forth under the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q and in our other SEC filings.\nOverview\nHistorically, we have been an early-stage biotechnology company focused on developing nucleic acid therapies targeting ribonucleic acid against validated\ntargets. In September 2022, we announced a significant reduction in force, suspension of preclinical activities and halting of all research and development, and\nthat we were exploring strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. While the foregoing efforts are continuing, we do not expect they will generate\nsignificant value for stockholders in the near term. Therefore, we are engaging in a broader exploration of strategic alternatives. This effort involves exploring\ngrowth through transactions with potential partners that see opportunity in joining an existing, publicly-traded organization. We are exploring transactions in\nindustries unrelated to our historical operations.\nBecause we currently have no source of revenue or committed financing, we will require substantial additional funding within the next several months in\norder to continue our exploration of strategic alternatives and consummate any transactions that we may identify.\nOperating, financing, and cash flow considerations\nSince our inception in 2011, we have primarily funded our operations through sales of our securities, loans and collaborations. As of June 30, 2023, our\ncash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $3.5 million. On February 24, 2023, we raised gross proceeds of $5.4 million on the closing of the Private\nPlacement (as defined below) (or net proceeds of approximately $4.6 million after transaction expenses) and expect to use the net proceeds for general working\ncapital purposes as we pursue strategic alternatives as well as for the payout for warrant put rights that were exercised as a result of the change of control.\nOur current liquidity is not sufficient to fund operations over the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial additional financing will be needed\nwithin the next several months to fund our operations and ongoing exploration of strategic alternatives and pursue any alternatives that we identify. If we are\nunable to raise capital, the Company may seek bankruptcy protection in the near term, which may result in the Company’s stockholders receiving no or very\nlittle value in respect of their shares of the Company’s common stock.\nWe expect to seek financing through equity offerings. However, it may be difficult to obtain financing given the Company’s current condition and\nuncertainty over its future direction. Therefore, we may be unable to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. Our failure to raise capital or enter into\nsuch other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to continue operations.\n29\nTable of Contents\nRecent Developments\nRestructuring\nOn December 10, 2021, we announced a strategic reduction in force and other cost cutting measures to reduce cash burn. On September 26, 2022, we\nannounced our commitment to a plan to wind down our existing preclinical programs, including the development of our SCN9A program, to suspend all of our\nresearch and development (“R&D”) activities, including suspension of all partnered programs, and to implement a reduction in force whereby we reduced\napproximately 66% of our then-existing workforce, as well as other cost-cutting measures (collectively, the “Plan”). The purpose of the Plan was to decrease\nexpenses, thereby, extending our cash runway, and enable us to maintain a streamlined organization to support key corporate functions.\nChange of Control\nOn February 24, 2023, following the satisfaction of closing conditions, including the approval by our stockholders at a Special Meeting of Stockholders\nheld on December 15, 2022, we closed our private placement (the “Private Placement”) to CBI USA. Exicure received gross proceeds of approximately $5.4\nmillion in connection with the close of the Private Placement (or net proceeds of approximately $4.6 million after transaction expenses) and expects to use the\nnet proceeds for general working capital purposes as we pursue strategic alternatives as well as for the payout for warrant put rights that were exercised as a\nresult of the change of control.\nFollowing the closing of the Private Placement, CBI USA is the beneficial owner of approximately 50.4% of the Company’s outstanding shares, resulting\nin a “change of control” of Exicure under the applicable Nasdaq rules. At closing, CBI USA designated three members to the Company’s board of directors. We\nare currently relying on Nasdaq’s “controlled company” exception to the requirements that a majority of our board be independent and that we have an\nindependent compensation committee and independent nominating committee or function.\nNasdaq Listing Requirements Deficiency Notice\nAs previously disclosed, the Company has received numerous deficiency notices with respect to various Nasdaq listing requirements in the past year.\nThese related to:\n• Compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price rule due to the Company’s stock trading below $1.00 for a sustained period of time. The Company\neffected a one-for-thirty reverse stock split on June 29, 2022 in order to attempt to raise the stock price. As of August 9, 2023, the Company’s stock\nprice closed at $0.86.\n• Compliance with Nasdaq’s rule requiring stockholders’ equity of at least $2,500,000 based on the Company’s balance sheet as of June 30, 2022. The\nCompany believes it is in compliance with this requirement based on its June 30, 2023 balance sheet, but there can be no assurance it will remain in\ncompliance.\n• Compliance with Nasdaq’s corporate governance requirements with respect to board and committee composition due to the lack of (i) a majority\nindependent board, (ii) an audit committee comprised of three independent directors and (iii) a compensation committee comprised of at least two\nindependent directors. With respect to the majority independence and the audit committee requirements, Nasdaq informed the Company that it was not\nentitled to a cure period and must submit a plan to regain compliance no later than April 10, 2023. Following the closing of the Private Placement, the\nCompany qualifies for Nasdaq’s controlled company exemptions from the requirements to have a majority independent board and independent\ncompensation committee. The Company must still have an audit committee comprised of three independent directors. On May 10, 2023, the Company\nreceived an additional delinquency notification regarding compliance with the listing requirements for an audit committee to be comprised of at least\nthree independent directors.\n• On August 4, 2023, the Company received an additional delinquency notification regarding compliance with the listing requirements for an audit\ncommittee to be comprised of at least three independent directors. The audit committee is currently comprised of only one independent director, and\ntherefore, the Company is no longer eligible for the cure period described in the delinquency notification received on May 10, 2023,\n30\nTable of Contents\nand previously disclosed. Under Rule 5605(c)(2), the Company has 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance. If the Company’s plan is\naccepted, Nasdaq can grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the delinquency notification. The Company is searching for\nqualified candidates to add as independent directors.\n• On May 17 2023, the Company received a delinquency notification as it had not filed its first quarter Form 10-Q at the deadline. On July 17, 2023, the\ncompany received a letter noting this delinquency was cured.\nWe may not be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements and our failure to do so may result in the delisting of our Common Stock by\nNasdaq. Even if the Company regains compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements and addresses the outstanding deficiency notices to Nasdaq’s satisfaction,\nthere can be no assurance that the Company will remain in compliance with Nasdaq’s requirements and will not be delisted.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared\nin accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the revenue and expenses incurred\nduring the reported periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances,\nthe results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Changes in\nestimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions.\nOur critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. There\nhave been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies from those which were discussed in our Annual Report.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of recent\naccounting pronouncements ASU 2016-13 adopted during the first quarter of 2023.\nRecent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nThere are no recent accounting pronouncements that the Company has not yet adopted.\n31\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nRevenue:\nCollaboration revenue $ — $ 2,471 $ (2,471) (100)%\nTotal revenue — 2,471 (2,471) (100)%\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development expense 921 6,749 (5,828) (86)%\nGeneral and administrative expense 4,721 3,205 1,516 47 %\nTotal operating expenses 5,642 9,954 (4,312) (43)%\nOperating loss (5,642) (7,483) 1,841 (25)%\nOther income (expense), net:\nDividend income 15 16 (1) (6)%\nInterest income 13 1 12 1,200 %\nInterest expense — — — — %\nOther expense, net (150) (4) (146) 3,650 %\nTotal other income (expense), net (122) 13 (135) (1,038)%\nNet loss before provision for income taxes (5,764) (7,470) 1,706 (23)%\nProvision for income taxes — — — — %\nNet loss $ (5,764) $ (7,470) $ 1,706 (23)%\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue earned during the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nCollaboration revenue:\nIpsen Collaboration Agreement $ — $ 1,775 $ (1,775) (100)%\nAbbVie Collaboration Agreement — 696 (696) (100)%\nTotal collaboration revenue $ — $ 2,471 $ (2,471) (100)%\nTotal revenue $ — $ 2,471 $ (2,471) (100)%\nCollaboration revenue was $0.0 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023, reflecting a decrease of $2.5 million, or 100%, from collaboration\nrevenue of $2.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in collaboration revenue of $2.5 million is due the termination of the Ipsen and\nAbbVie Collaboration Agreements in December 2022 that resulted in recognition of the remaining deferred revenue associated with each of those collaboration\nagreements in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n32\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development expense\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nEmployee-related expense $ 87 $ 2,339 $ (2,252) (96)%\nPlatform and discovery-related expense 215 1,997 (1,782) (89)%\nFacilities, depreciation, and other expenses 594 1,229 (635) (52)%\nClinical development programs expense 25 1,184 (1,159) (98)%\nTotal research and development expense $ 921 $ 6,749 $ (5,828) (86)%\nFull time employees 1 31 (30)\nResearch and development expense was $0.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, reflecting a decrease of $5.8 million, or 86%, from\nresearch and development expense of $6.7 million for three months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in research and development expense for the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2023 of $5.8 million reflects the suspension of clinical, preclinical, and discovery program activities and the reduction in headcount\nresulting from the restructuring activities that were announced in December 2021 and September 2022. More specifically, the decrease in research and\ndevelopment expense for the three months ended June 30, 2023 of $5.8 million was primarily due to a decrease in costs related to lower employee-related\nexpense of $2.3 million from reduced headcount, lower platform and discovery-related expense of $1.8 million, and clinical development programs of $1.2\nmillion.\nThe decrease in employee-related expense for the three months ended June 30, 2023 of $2.3 million was due to lower compensation and related costs in\nconnection with a lower headcount during the period resulting from the restructuring activities that were announced in September 2022 and December 2021.\nThe decrease in platform and discovery-related expense for the three months ended June 30, 2023 of $1.8 million was mostly due to lower CRO and\nmaterials costs, all in connection with suspension of R&D activities in connection with reduction in headcount and fewer R&D activities.\nThe decrease in clinical development programs expense for the three months ended June 30, 2023 of $1.2 million was primarily due to lower\nmanufacturing and toxicology study costs in connection with IND-enabling and Phase 1 clinical trial preparation activities for the XCUR-FXN program, which\nwas indefinitely suspended in December 2021, contributed to the decrease in clinical development program expense as compared to the prior-year period.\nGeneral and administrative expense\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nGeneral and administrative expense $ 4,721 $ 3,205 1,516 47 %\nFull time employees 6 8 (2)\nGeneral and administrative expense was $4.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, representing an increase of $1.5 million, or 47%, from\n$3.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was mostly due to higher costs due to separation\npay for executives and related stock based compensation expense, legal and consulting fees, partially offset by lower bonus, retention, and insurance expense.\n33\nTable of Contents\nComparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nRevenue:\nCollaboration revenue $ — $ 5,036 $ (5,036) (100)%\nTotal revenue — 5,036 (5,036) (100)%\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development expense 2,902 13,889 (10,987) (79)%\nGeneral and administrative expense 7,279 6,367 912 14 %\nTotal operating expenses 10,181 20,256 (10,075) (50)%\nOperating loss (10,181) (15,220) 5,039 (33)%\nOther (expense) income, net:\nDividend income 32 18 14 78 %\nInterest income 24 3 21 700 %\nInterest expense — (595) 595 (100)%\nOther expense, net (46) (24) (22) 92 %\nTotal other expense, net 10 (598) 608 (102)%\nNet loss before provision for income taxes (10,171) (15,818) 5,647 (36)%\nProvision for income taxes — — — — %\nNet loss $ (10,171) $ (15,818) $ 5,647 (36)%\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue earned during the periods indicated:\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nCollaboration revenue:\nIpsen Collaboration Agreement $ — $ 3,854 $ (3,854) (100)%\nAbbVie Collaboration Agreement — 1,182 (1,182) (100)%\nTotal collaboration revenue $ — $ 5,036 $ (5,036) (100)%\nTotal revenue $ — $ 5,036 $ (5,036) (100)%\nCollaboration revenue was $0.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023, reflecting a decrease of $5.0 million, or 100%, from collaboration\nrevenue of $5.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022.

The decrease in research and development expense for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2023 of $11.0 million reflects the suspension of clinical, preclinical, and discovery program activities and the reduction in headcount resulting from\nthe restructuring activities that were announced in December 2021 and September 2022. More specifically, the decrease in research and development expense\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2023 of $11.0 million was primarily due to a decrease in costs related to lower platform and discovery-related expense of\n$4.0 million, lower employee-related expense of $3.3 million, and lower clinical development programs of $2.8 million.\nThe decrease in platform and discovery-related expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023 of $4.0 million was mostly due to lower CRO and\nmaterials costs, all in connection with suspension of R&D activities in connection with reduction in headcount and fewer R&D activities.\nThe decrease in employee-related expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023 of $3.3 million was due to lower compensation and related costs in\nconnection with a lower average headcount during the period resulting from the restructuring activities that were announced in September 2022 and December\n2021.\nThe decrease in clinical development programs expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023 of $2.8 million was primarily due to lower manufacturing\nand toxicology study costs in connection with IND-enabling and Phase 1 clinical trial preparation activities for the XCUR-FXN program which we indefinitely\nsuspended in December 2021, contributed to the decrease in clinical development program expense as compared to the prior-year period.\nGeneral and administrative expense\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nGeneral and administrative expense $ 7,279 $ 6,367 912 14 %\nFull time employees 6 8 (2)\nGeneral and administrative expense was $7.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, representing an increase of $0.9 million or 14%, from $6.4\nmillion for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was mostly due to higher costs due to separation pay for\nexecutives and related stock based compensation expense, and consulting fees, partially offset by lower bonus, retention, and insurance expense.\n35\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses as an early-stage biotechnological company. We have generated limited revenue to date\nfrom our collaboration agreements, which have since been terminated. We have not commercialized any of our product candidates, and we do not expect to\ngenerate revenue from sales of any product. We have funded our operations to date with proceeds received from equity financings and payments received in\nconnection with collaboration agreements, which have since been terminated. Currently we are exploring strategic alternatives and generating little to no\nrevenue.\nAs of June 30, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $3.5 million as compared to $9.8 million as of December 31, 2022. To date, we\nhave funded our operations primarily with proceeds received from equity financings and to a lesser extent, payments received in connection with collaboration\nagreements. We have generated limited revenue to date from our collaboration agreements.\nWe incurred net losses of approximately $10.2 million and $15.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of June 30,\n2023, we have generated an accumulated deficit of $201.7 million since inception and expect to incur significant expenses and negative cash flows for the\nforeseeable future.\nBased on our current operating plans and existing working capital at June 30, 2023, it is uncertain whether our current liquidity is sufficient to fund\noperations over the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. As a result,\nthere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial additional financing will be needed to fund our operations and there is no\ncertainty we will obtain such financing. If we are unable to raise capital, we will need to consider other various strategic alternatives, including a merger or\nsale, or be unable to continue operations. We may need to seek bankruptcy protection in the near term, which may result in our stockholders receiving no or\nvery little value in respect of their shares of our common stock.\nSee “Funding Requirements” below for additional information on our future capital needs.\nPrivate Placements\nIn September 2022, we entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement with CBI USA, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to CBI USA in a\nprivate placement an aggregate of 3,400,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at a purchase price of $1.60 per share. This Private\nPlacement closed on February 24, 2023. Immediately following the closing of the Private Placement, CBI USA held approximately 50.4% of the shares of our\ncommon stock.\nIn May 2022, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with several accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued and sold 867,369 shares of\ncommon stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at a purchase price of $5.81 per share for net proceeds of approximately $4.9 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30,\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\n(unaudited)\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (8,129) $ (21,834)\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities (1,789) 3,491\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 3,676 (3,103)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (6,242) $ (21,446)\n36\nTable of Contents\nOperating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $8.1 million and $21.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in\ncash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 of $13.7 million was due to the suspension of R&D activities and lower headcount\nfrom the September 2022 and December 2021 restructurings.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.8 million and and provided by investing activities was $3.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by investing activities of $5.3 million was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the maturity, net of\npurchases, of available-for-sale securities.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash provided in financing activities of $3.7 million for six months ended June 30, 2023 is due to the Private Placement closed in February. Net cash\nused by financing activities of $3.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to the repayment in full of all outstanding indebtedness\nand other obligations under the Credit and Security Agreement, dated as of September 25, 2020, as amended on October 21, 2020, July 30, 2021, September\n30, 2021, and December 10, 2021, with MidCap Financial Trust, as agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time, or the MidCap Credit Agreement,\npartially offset by net proceeds of approximately $4.9 million received in connection with the May 2022 private placement transaction.\nFunding Requirements\nWe will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on\nacceptable terms, we would be forced to consider other various strategic alternatives, including a merger or sale; or cease operations.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth\nquarter of 2023. However, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than\nwe currently expect. Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including:\n• the results of our exploration of strategic alternatives, including any potential transactions or collaborations;\n• the results of any future or pending litigation against the Company;\n• the extent to which we encounter increased costs as a result of global and macroeconomic conditions, including rising inflation and interest rates,\nsupply chain disruptions, fluctuating exchange rates, and increases in commodity, energy and fuel prices; and\n• unknown legal, administrative, regulatory, accounting, and information technology costs as well as additional costs associated with operating as a\npublic company.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings and\ndistribution or licensing arrangements with third parties. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities,\nthe ownership interest of our stockholders may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that\nadversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive\ncovenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Further, the\nglobal financial markets have experienced significant disruptions over the past couple of years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing conflict between\nRussia and Ukraine, and worsening global macroeconomic conditions, including actions taken by central banks to counter inflation, volatility in the capital\nmarkets and related market uncertainty, may impact our ability to obtain additional financing when needed on favorable terms or at all. Any further disruption\nor\n37\nTable of Contents\nslowdown in the global financial markets and economy may negatively affect our ability to raise funding through equity or debt financings on attractive terms\nor at all, which could in the future negatively affect our operations.\nGoing Concern\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 205-40, Going Concern, we have evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in\nthe aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements are issued. In the absence of a significant source of recurring revenue, our continued viability is dependent on our ability to\ncontinue to raise additional capital to finance our operations. As discussed above, there are substantial uncertainties about our ability to raise such financing.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThere have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments from those described in our Annual Report.\nJOBS Act\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, an emerging\ngrowth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth\ncompany can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected\nnot to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which\nadoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nIn addition, as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to provide an auditor’s attestation report on our internal control over financial\nreporting in future annual reports on Form 10-K as otherwise required by Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nAs a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure\nreporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management\nrecognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives\nand management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures as of June 30, 2023. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2023, our principal executive\nofficer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nOur management reached these conclusions notwithstanding the fact that on May 15, 2023, we filed with the SEC a Notification of Late Filing, pursuant to\nRule 12b-25 under the Exchange Act, with respect to\n38\nTable of Contents\nour Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Such quarterly report was delayed due to a change in the Company’s auditor as\nfurther described in the Form 12b-25.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nHowever, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors\nand all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the\ncontrol system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be\nconsidered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be\nfaulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons,\nby collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential\nfuture conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n39\nTable of Contents\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nOn December 13, 2021, Mark Colwell filed a putative securities class action lawsuit against the Company, David A. Giljohann and Brian C. Bock in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, captioned Colwell v. Exicure, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-0663. On February 4, 2021, plaintiff\nfiled an amended putative securities class action complaint. On March 20, 2023, the court entered an order appointing James Mathew as lead plaintiff and\nBleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP as lead counsel in the action pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. On May 26, 2023, lead plaintiff\nfiled a second amended complaint against the Company, Dr. Giljohann, Mr. Bock, and Grant Corbett. The second amended complaint alleges that Dr.\nGiljohann, Mr. Bock, and Dr. Corbett made materially false and/or misleading statements related to the Company’s clinical programs purportedly causing\nlosses to investors who acquired Company securities between January 7, 2021 and December 10, 2021. The second amended complaint does not quantify any\nalleged damages but, in addition to attorneys’ fees and costs, lead plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of himself and others who acquired the\nCompany’s stock during the putative class period at allegedly inflated prices and purportedly suffered financial harm as a result. The Company intends to move\nto dismiss the second amended complaint.\nOn March 1, 2022, Kapil Puri filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit on behalf of the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District\nof Illinois, against Messrs. Giljohann and Bock, Jeffrey L. Cleland, Elizabeth Garofalo, Bosun Hau, Bali Muralidhar, Andrew Sassine, Matthias Schroff, James\nSulat and Timothy Walbert, captioned Puri v. Giljohann, et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-01083. On March 8, 2022, Yixin Sim filed a similar shareholder derivative\nlawsuit in the same court against the same individuals, captioned Sim v. Giljohann, et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-01217. On April 25, 2022, Stourbridge Investments\nLLC filed a similar shareholder derivative lawsuit against the same individuals in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned\nStourbridge Investments LLC v. Exicure, Inc. et al., Case No. 1:22-cv-00526. Based on similar factual allegations presented in the Colwell complaint, described\nabove, the Puri, Sim, and Stourbridge complaints, or collectively, the Derivative Complaints, allege that the defendants caused the Company to issue false\nand/or misleading statements in its 2021 proxy statement regarding risk oversight, code of conduct, clinical program and compensation matters, among other\nthings, in violation of federal securities law, and committed breaches of fiduciary duties. The Derivative Complaints also assert that Dr. Giljohann and Mr.\nBock are liable for contribution under the federal securities laws. The Puri and Stourbridge complaints further assert state law claims for unjust enrichment,\nand the Puri complaint additionally asserts state law claims for abuse of control, gross mismanagement and corporate waste. The plaintiffs do not quantify any\nalleged damages in the Derivative Complaints, but seek restitution for damages to the Company, attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses, as well as an order\ndirecting that certain proposals for strengthening board oversight be put to a vote of the Company’s shareholders.\nOn March 18, 2022, James McNabb, through counsel, sent a written demand to the Company (the “Demand Letter”) demanding that the Board of\nDirectors investigate certain allegations and commence proceedings on the Company’s behalf against certain of the Company’s current officers and directors\nfor alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and corporate waste. All of the Derivative Cases have been stayed pending a decision on any motion to dismiss that\nmay be filed in the Colwell case. In addition, the Stourbridge case has been administratively closed pending the decision on motion to dismiss that may be filed\nin the Colwell case. Further, pursuant to agreement, the Demand Letter is being held in abeyance and any related statute of limitations tolled pending such\nmotion and decision.\nIn June 2023, a director of the Company designated by CBI USA served a demand on the Company to access certain books and records pursuant to Section\n220(d) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Company served its response and is working with the director to resolve this demand amicably and in\naccordance with the Company’s obligations under Delaware law.\nWe may also be a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot\nbe predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRegardless of the outcome,\n40\nTable of Contents\nlitigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\n41\nTable of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the following risks should be considered in evaluating our business and\nfuture prospects and an investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following\nrisks and uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely\naffected. In that case, the price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur exploration of strategic alternatives may not be successful.\nGiven the Company’s current focus to explore growth through strategic transactions with potential partners, the Company’s ability to execute its current\nbusiness plan depends on its ability to obtain additional funding via a strategic transaction or a series of strategic transactions, or to obtain funding to support\nsuch a transaction. We currently have no source of revenues or committed financing, and our financial resources are limited to our cash and cash equivalents.\nWith respect to our efforts to maximize value from historical assets, while those efforts are continuing, based on the interest we have received to date we do not\nthink it is likely they will generate significant value, at least in the near term.\nThe Company plans to continue actively pursuing strategic alternatives, however, there can be no assurance that the Company will have sufficient\nresources or obtain additional financing necessary to complete this effort. Even if we do have such resources or can obtain financing, we may not be able to\nconsummate such a transaction in a timely manner or at all or in a manner that would not adversely impact our business. The accompanying financial\nstatements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Strategic transactions are complex and time-consuming to\nidentify, evaluate, negotiate and consummate in compliance with applicable laws and Nasdaq requirements. Our board and management do not have\nmeaningful experience executing this type of endeavor in the U.S. public markets. Even if we are successful in entering into a strategic transaction, the terms\nand conditions of that transaction may restrict us from entering into future agreements with other potential collaborators. Additionally, such strategic\ntransactions may not be favorable to investors nor deliver any anticipated benefits by the time of business integration.\nWe need to obtain substantial funding in the near term in order to continue operations and our exploration of strategic alternatives.\nWe require significant capital resources in order to continue to operate our business and conduct our exploration of strategic alternatives, and our limited\nliquidity could materially and adversely affect our business operations. Because we have no current source of revenue or committed financing, our current\navailable cash and cash equivalents provide us with limited liquidity. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents could allow us to fund our business\noperations into early in the fourth quarter of 2023; however, it is very difficult to project our current monthly cash burn rate given the transitional status of the\nCompany and this estimate may prove inaccurate and we may expend our limited resources sooner. Any such required additional capital may not be available\non reasonable terms, if at all, due to a variety of factors, including uncertainty about the future direction of the Company and investor reaction to our new\ncontrolling stockholder and board composition, as well as broader conditions in the economy and capital markets, including recent volatility caused by\ninflation, questions about bank stability and other factors. The Company has already engaged in significant cost reductions, so our ability to further cut costs\nand extend our operating runway is limited. Without sufficient additional capital funding in the near term, we may be required, among other things, to seek\nbankruptcy protection.\nOur controlling stockholder, executive officers and members of our board, have limited experience controlling or governing a public company\noperating in the United States.\nOur controlling stockholder has not previously controlled a U.S. public company. In addition, the majority of our board is made of up Korean citizens, and\nno members of the board or our chief executive officer or chief financial officer have experience serving as directors or management of a U.S. publicly traded\ncompany. This could make it difficult to ensure that the Company complies with all applicable laws and stock exchange requirements, maintains adequate\ninternal and disclosure controls and appropriately assesses and manages risk. This concern is exacerbated by the limited resources the Company has following\nrecent reductions in force, and if there are further reductions in force or members of management leave the Company, it may be very difficult to manage this\nrisk. The transitional state of the Company and ongoing exploration of strategic alternatives also exacerbates the challenging environment in this respect. If the\nboard of directors does not successfully or efficiently manage their roles and responsibilities, including the significant regulatory oversight and reporting\nobligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of investors, our prospects may be adversely impacted. In addition, against this\nbackdrop, it may be difficult to earn the confidence of\n42\nTable of Contents\nprospective investors or strategic partners, threatening our ability to obtain much needed financing and hindering our exploration of strategic alternatives.\nTurnover of senior management, and any inability to attract and retain qualified management and other key personnel, could impair our ability to\nimplement our business plan.\nAs we continue our exploration of strategic alternatives, and potentially pursue transactions involving new business lines or industries, we expect\nsignificant turnover in senior management. Departures of members of our senior management team and board members, will create significant continuity risks\nand challenges to our ability to operate our business, assess and manage risks and comply with applicable laws. If key members of our senior management\nteam depart, which we believe is likely in the near term, it will be important that we attract and retain qualified managers promptly and develop and implement\nan effective succession plan. We expect to face significant competition in attracting experienced executives and other key personnel, and there can be no\nassurance that we will be able to do so. In addition, there are significant uncertainties as to how our controlled company status, transitional state of operations,\nfinancial condition and related matters will impact our ability to attract the necessary personnel and manage these succession risks. Depending on the\ncircumstances of any management departures, it is also possible that we will be required to pay significant severance, adversely impacting our financial\ncondition. Our urgent need to raise capital and engage with potential partners in strategic transactions magnify these risks. If we are unable to adequately\naddress these concerns in the near term, and earn the confidence of potential investors and/or business partners, our prospects and financial condition would be\nadversely impacted.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern will require us to obtain additional funding. Based on our current operating plans and existing working capital at\nJune 30, 2023, our current liquidity is not sufficient to fund operations over the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial additional financing will be\nneeded by us to fund our operations and exploration of strategic alternatives in the near term. Although we currently estimate that available funds could be\nsufficient into early in the fourth quarter of 2023, we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could spend our available\nfinancial resources much faster than we currently expect. It is very difficult to project our current monthly cash burn rate given the transitional status of the\nCompany as we explore strategic alternatives. The perception of our ability to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing\nfor the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors and employees. Obtaining additional financing contains risks,\nincluding:\n• additional equity financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms and any equity we are able to issue could lead to dilution for current\nstockholders;\n• loans or other debt instruments may have terms and/or conditions, such as interest rate, restrictive covenants and control or revocation provisions;\n• the current environment in capital markets combined with our capital constraints may prevent us from being able to obtain adequate debt financing;\nand\n• if we fail to obtain required additional financing to grow our business we may need to seek bankruptcy protection in the near term.\nWe currently do not comply with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements. Our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq which could negatively\nimpact the price of our common stock, liquidity and our ability to access the capital markets.\nOur common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “XCUR.” As previously disclosed, the Company has received numerous deficiency\nnotes with respect to various Nasdaq listing requirements in the past year. These related to:\n• Compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price rule due to the Company’s stock trading below $1.00 for a sustained period of time. The Company\neffected a one-for-thirty reverse stock split on June 29, 2022 in order to attempt to raise the stock price. As of August 9, 2023, the Company’s stock\nprice closed at $0.86.\n• Compliance with Nasdaq’s rule requiring stockholders’ equity of at least $2,500,000 based on the Company’s balance sheet as of June 30, 2023. The\nCompany believes it is in compliance with this requirement based on its June 30, 2023 balance sheet, but there can be no assurance it will remain in\ncompliance.\n43\nTable of Contents\n• Compliance with Nasdaq’s corporate governance requirements with respect to board and committee composition due to (i) the lack of a majority\nindependent board, (ii) the lack of an audit committee comprised of three independent directors and (iii) the lack of a compensation committee\ncomprised of at least two independent directors. With respect to the majority independence and the audit committee requirements, Nasdaq informed\nthe Company that it was not entitled to a cure period and must submit a plan to regain compliance no later than April 10, 2023. Following the closing\nof the Private Placement, the Company qualifies for Nasdaq’s controlled company exemptions from the requirements to have a majority independent\nboard and independent compensation committee. The Company must still have an audit committee comprised of three independent directors. On May\n10, 2023 the Company received an additional delinquency notification regarding compliance with the listing requirements for an audit committee to\nbe comprised of at least three independent directors.\n• On August 4, 2023, the Company received an additional delinquency notification regarding compliance with the listing requirements for an audit\ncommittee to be comprised of at least three independent directors. The audit committee is currently comprised of only one independent director, and\ntherefore, the Company is no longer eligible for the cure period described in the delinquency notification received on May 10, 2023, and previously\ndisclosed. Under Rule 5605(c)(2), the Company has 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance. If the Company’s plan is accepted,\nNasdaq can grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the delinquency notification.The Company is searching for qualified\ncandidates to add as independent directors.\nWe may not be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements and our failure to do so may result in the delisting of our Common Stock by\nNasdaq. Even if the Company regains compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements and addresses the outstanding deficiency notices to Nasdaq’s satisfaction,\nthere can be no assurance that the Company will remain in compliance with Nasdaq’s requirements and will not be delisted.\nIf Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, we and our stockholders could face significant\nnegative consequences including:\n• limited availability of market quotations and liquidity for our securities;\n• a determination that the common stock is a “penny stock” which would require brokers trading in the common stock to adhere to more stringent rules,\npossibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for shares of common stock;\n• a limited amount of analyst coverage, if any; and\n• a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nDelisting from Nasdaq could also result in other negative consequences, including the potential loss of institutional investor interest and make obtaining\nnew financing much more challenging. In addition, fewer strategic opportunities may be available, particularly from counterparties that are interested in\ncombining with a listed company.\nWe have a history of losses. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability,\nwhich could result in a decline in the market value of our common stock.\nBetween our inception in June 2011 and the Company’s decision to engage in a broader exploration of strategic alternatives, we devoted our resources to\nthe development of SNA technology, and are currently exploring out-licensing opportunities and strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. We have\nhad significant operating losses since our inception. As of June 30, 2023, we have generated an accumulated deficit of $201.7 million. For the six months ended\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022, our net loss was $10.2 million and $15.8 million, respectively. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in\nconnection with our research programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nWe have not generated, and do not expect to generate, any product revenue for the foreseeable future and currently have no source of revenue or\ncommitted financing, and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. The amount of future losses is uncertain. Our\nfuture financial performance and condition are substantially dependent on the results of our ongoing exploration of strategic alternatives, and we cannot predict\nwhether we will be successful.\nWe are pursuing asset out-licenses, asset sales and similar strategic transactions with respect to our historical assets. There can be no assurance that we will\nbe successful in executing such a strategic transaction.\n44\nTable of Contents\nThese strategic alternatives may include a variety of different business arrangements, such as the sale of certain of our assets, out-licensing, strategic\npartnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, investments and other alternatives. We may not be able to identify or consummate a suitable transaction\nas a result of this review, or any transactions that we are able to identify and consummate may not provide material benefits to our stockholders. Based on the\ninterest in these assets that we have seen to date, we do not currently expect any such transaction to provide significant value, at least in the near term.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption\nof our business operations.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage\nfrom computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause\ninterruptions of our operations. For instance, theft or other exposure of data may interfere with our ability to protect our intellectual property, trade secrets, and\nother information critical to our operations. We can provide no assurances that certain sensitive and proprietary information relating to one or more of our\ntherapeutic candidates has not been, or will not in the future e, compromised. Although we have invested resources to enhance the security of our computer\nsystems, there can be no assurances we will not experience additional unauthorized intrusions into our computer systems, or those of our contractors and\nconsultants, that we will successfully detect future unauthorized intrusions in a timely manner, or that future unauthorized intrusions will not result in material\nadverse effects on our financial condition, reputation, or business prospects. Payments related to the elimination of ransomware may materially affect our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nTo the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or\nproprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of our therapeutic candidates could be delayed.\nOur information technology systems could face serious disruptions that could adversely affect our business.\nOur information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including corporate firewalls, servers, documents storage systems, backup systems,\nleased lines and connection to the Internet, face the risk of systemic failure that could disrupt our operations. A significant disruption in the availability of our\ninformation technology and other internal infrastructure systems could cause interruptions and delays in our operations.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or unauthorized or inappropriate use of or access to our information\ntechnology systems.\nWe are increasingly dependent on our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We collect, store and transmit sensitive\ninformation including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information in connection with business operations. The secure\nmaintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Some of this information could be an attractive target of criminal attack or\nunauthorized access and use by third parties with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, “hacktivists,” patient groups,\ndisgruntled current or former employees and others. Cyber-attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication, and despite our security measures, our\ninformation technology systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to such attacks or may be breached, including due to employee error or malfeasance.\nThe pervasiveness of cybersecurity incidents in general and the risks of cyber-crime are complex and continue to evolve. Although we are making\nsignificant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and are exploring various measures to manage the risk of a security breach\nor disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be\nsuccessful or damaging. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our employees, contractors and\nconsultants are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, unauthorized or inappropriate access or use, natural disasters, pandemics\n(including COVID-19), terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause interruption of our operations. For example, the\nloss or compromise of preclinical data for our therapeutic candidates could result in delays in our regulatory filings and development efforts, as well as delays\nin the commercialization of our products, and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption, security breach or unauthorized or\ninappropriate use or access to our systems were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary\ninformation, including but not limited to patient, employee or vendor information, we could incur notification obligations to affected individuals and\ngovernment agencies, liability, including potential lawsuits from patients, collaborators, employees, stockholders or other third parties and liability under\nforeign, federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information, and the development and potential commercialization of our\ntherapeutic candidates could be delayed. Existing insurance\n45\nTable of Contents\narrangements may not provide protection for the costs that may arise from such loss or damage. Any long-term disruption in our ability to access our\ninformation technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations, our business, results of operations and stock price.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social\nand governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and\ngovernance practices. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they\nrelate to the environment, health and safety, supply chain management, diversity and human rights. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements\nor investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation and the price of our ordinary shares.\nAny of the factors mentioned above, or the perception that we or our suppliers, or contract manufacturers or collaborators have not responded\nappropriately to the growing concern for such issues, regardless of whether we are legally required to do so, may damage our reputation and have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations cash flows and/or ordinary share price.\nOur current operations are concentrated in one location and any events affecting this location may have material adverse consequences.\nOur current operations are located in our facilities situated in Chicago, Illinois. Any unplanned event, such as flood, fire, explosion, earthquake, extreme\nweather condition, medical epidemics, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or man-made accidents or incidents that result in us being\nunable to fully utilize the facilities, may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant\nnegative consequences on our financial and operating conditions. Loss of access to these facilities may result in increased costs, or interruption of our business\noperations. As part of our risk management policy, we maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe are appropriate for our business. However, in the\nevent of an accident or incident at these facilities, we cannot assure you that the amounts of insurance will be sufficient to satisfy any damages and losses. If\nour facilities are unable to operate because of an accident or incident or for any other reason, even for a short period of time, any or all of our research and\ndevelopment programs may be harmed. Any business interruption may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations\nand prospects.\nThe investment of our cash, cash equivalents and fixed income marketable securities is subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity\nof these investments.\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had $3.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. We invest our excess cash in U.S. government or U.S. government\nagency securities, floating rate and variable rate demand notes of U.S. and foreign corporations, and commercial paper. These investments are subject to\ngeneral credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, including potential future impacts from economic, capital market or bank instability. We may from time\nto time have balances in bank accounts that are in excess of insured deposit limits, and could be subject to risks of bank failures. We may realize losses in the\nfair value of these investments, an inability to access cash in these investments for a potentially meaningful period, or a complete loss of these investments,\nwhich would have a negative effect on our financial statements.\nIn addition, should our investments cease paying or reduce the amount of interest paid to us, our interest income would suffer. The market risks associated\nwith our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of\nNasdaq. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our\ninternal control over financial reporting to allow our management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, while\nwe remain a non-accelerated filer or an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial\nreporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm.\n46\nTable of Contents\nDuring the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be\nunable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Further, we may in the future discover weaknesses in our system of internal\nfinancial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. Moreover, our internal controls over\nfinancial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,\nnot absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. Moreover,\nwe are aware that the remote working arrangements implemented in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic potentially present new areas of risk, and we\ncontinue to carefully monitor any impact to our internal controls and procedures.\nOur limited resources and recent reductions in force, as well as the turnover in our board of directors and the potential for future management changes,\npresent significant continuity risk and could impact our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial\nstatements, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory\nauthorities.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe currently license patent rights from Northwestern University. If Northwestern University does not properly or successfully obtain, maintain or enforce\nthe patents underlying such licenses, or if they retain or license to others any competing rights, our competitive position and business prospects may be\nadversely affected.\nWe rely on intellectual property rights licensed from third parties to protect our technology. We are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to\nthird-party intellectual property that is necessary or useful for our business. In particular, we have a license from Northwestern University, which provides us\nthe exclusive worldwide right under certain patents and patent applications owned by Northwestern University to exploit therapeutics and processes using\nnanoparticles, nanotechnology, microtechnology and nanomaterial-based constructs as therapeutics or accompanying therapeutics as a means of administration.\nTo the extent we are successful in selling, licensing or otherwise generating value from our historical assets, it would depend significantly on the value of the\nrights licenses from Northwestern. We may also license additional third-party intellectual property in the future. Our success will depend in part on the ability\nof our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our licensed intellectual property, and in particular, for those patents to which we have\nsecured exclusive rights. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications licensed to us. Even if patents issue or are granted, our licensors\nmay fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents, or may pursue litigation less\naggressively than we would. Further, we may not obtain exclusive rights, which would allow for third parties to develop competing therapeutics. Without\nprotection for, or exclusive rights to, the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical therapeutics for sale,\nwhich could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.\nWe or our licensors, or any current or future strategic partners, may become subject to third-party claims or litigation alleging infringement of patents or\nother proprietary rights or seeking to invalidate patents or other proprietary rights, and we may need to resort to litigation to protect or enforce our patents\nor other proprietary rights, all of which could be costly, time consuming, or put our patents and other proprietary rights at risk.\nWe or our licensors, or any current or future strategic partners, may be subject to third-party claims for infringement or misappropriation of patent or other\nproprietary rights. We are generally obligated under our license agreements to indemnify and hold harmless our licensors for damages arising from intellectual\nproperty infringement by us. If we or our licensors, or any current or future strategic partners, are found to infringe a third-party patent or other intellectual\nproperty rights, we could be required to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed. In addition, we or our\nlicensors, or any current or future strategic partners, may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from a third-party, which may not be available on\nacceptable terms, if at all. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to\nthe same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license, we or any current or future collaborator may be unable\nto effectively market therapeutic candidates based on our technology, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly\nprevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations. In addition, we may find it necessary to pursue claims or initiate lawsuits to protect or\nenforce our patent or other intellectual property rights. The cost to us in defending or initiating any litigation or other proceeding relating to\n47\nTable of Contents\npatent or other proprietary rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management’s attention. Some of our\ncompetitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources.\nUncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts and limit\nour ability to continue our operations.\nIf we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a patent covering one of our therapeutics or our technology, the defendant could\ncounterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are\ncommonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty,\nobviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent\nwithheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and\nunenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating\nprior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or\nunenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our therapeutics or certain aspects of our technology.\nSuch a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. Patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our\ntechnology if competitors design around our protected technology without legally infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights.\nIt is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, U.S. applications filed before November 29,\n2000 and certain U.S. applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the U.S. remain confidential until patents issue. Patent applications in the\nU.S. and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly\nreferred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our therapeutics or technology could have been filed by others without our knowledge.\nAdditionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our SNA\ntechnology, our therapeutics or the use of our therapeutics. Third-party intellectual property right holders may also actively bring infringement claims against\nus. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such infringement claims. If we are unable to successfully settle future\nclaims on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to engage in or continue costly, unpredictable and time-consuming litigation and may be prevented from\nor experience substantial delays in marketing our therapeutics. If we fail in any such dispute, in addition to being forced to pay damages, we may be\ntemporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing any of our therapeutic candidates that are held to be infringing. We might, if possible, also be\nforced to redesign therapeutic candidates so that we no longer infringe the third-party intellectual property rights. Any of these events, even if we were\nultimately to prevail, could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that former employees or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property.\nLitigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in\naddition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEven if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and distraction to management and other employees.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, collaboration or other agreements, we may be required to pay damages and could lose\nintellectual property rights that are necessary for developing and protecting our therapeutic candidates or we could lose certain rights to grant sublicenses.\nOur current licenses impose, and any future licenses we enter into are likely to impose, various development, commercialization, funding, milestone,\nroyalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement, and other obligations on us. If we breach any of these obligations, or use the\nintellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license,\nwhich could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture and sell therapeutics that are covered by the licensed technology or could enable a competitor to\ngain access to the licensed technology. Moreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been licensed to us and, as a result, we\nmay be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or otherwise violating the licensor’s rights in such unlicensed intellectual property. In\naddition, while we cannot currently determine the amount of the royalty obligations we would be required to pay on sales\n48\nTable of Contents\nof future therapeutics, if any, the amounts may be significant. The amount of our future royalty obligations will depend on the technology and intellectual\nproperty we use in therapeutics that we successfully develop and commercialize, if any. Therefore, even if we successfully develop and commercialize\ntherapeutics, we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur status as a “controlled company” could make our Common Stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm the trading price of our Common\nStock.\nMore than 50% of our voting power is held by CBI USA. As a result, we are a “controlled company” under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-\nlisted companies and may elect not to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements with respect to board independence and compensation\nand nominating committee functions. We are relying on these exceptions. Following the closing of the Private Placement, our board includes 5 members, 2 of\nwhom are affiliated or associated with CBI USA or were otherwise delegated by CBI USA. Investors may be hesitant to invest in the Company absent\ncompliance with these governance requirements. In addition, should the interest or interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other\nstockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate\ngovernance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Common Stock less attractive to some investors, including\nbut not limited to potential strategic partners, or otherwise harm our stock price.\nAdditionally, it is possible we could pursue strategic or financing transactions with our controlling stockholder or its affiliates. The interests of the\ncontrolling stockholder and other stockholders would diverge in this case, and the lack of an independent board to evaluate such a transaction could adversely\nimpact other stockholders. These conflicts of interest (or the perception that they could occur) might adversely affect our business and prospects for obtaining\nfinancing or completing a strategic transaction.\nFor so long as CBI USA owns a majority of our common stock, it will have sufficient votes to elect a majority of our directors and to approve any other\ncorporate action requiring the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. Our control by a single stockholder,\nand our reliance on the Nasdaq controlled company exemptions, could deter investment in the Company and adversely impact our stock price and ability to\nobtain financing. These impacts may be more pronounced in the near term as investors assess the direction of the Company under the control of CBI USA and\nthe actions of the new board. Potential partners considering engaging in a strategic transaction with the Company could have similar concerns. Given our\nurgent need for additional funding and/or to complete a strategic transaction, it is imperative that our controlling stockholder and our board earn the confidence\nof investors and potential partners in the near term and there is no assurance this will occur.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above\nthe price you paid for them.\nOur stock price will continue to be volatile. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for\nthe shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by a variety of factors, including the other risks described in this section titled “Risk\nFactors” and the following:\n• our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n• the development, execution and announcement of any proposed strategic alternative;\n• investors may react negatively to our controlled company status and the influence of our controlling stockholder or our reconstituted board and/or our\nuncertain business strategy;\n• strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business\nstrategy;\n• we are unable to achieve the perceived benefits of our Company as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts; and\n• changes in general economic, industry, political and market conditions, including, but not limited to, the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility\nthat has been often unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad\n49\nTable of Contents\nmarket and industry factors, such as those related to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and retaliatory actions taken by the United\nStates, NATO and others, may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nRaising additional funds by issuing securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements\nmay restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenues, we expect to attempt to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings\nand debt financings. As discussed elsewhere, it may be very challenging to obtain equity or debt financing given the current transitional state of the Company.\nHowever, to the extent that we raise additional capital through the issuance of shares or other securities convertible into shares, our stockholders will be diluted.\nFuture issuances of our common stock or other equity securities, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price\nof our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-linked securities.\nWe are an “emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will\nmake our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take\nadvantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including\n(1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) reduced disclosure obligations\nregarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory\nvote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, as an emerging growth\ncompany, we are only required to provide two years of audited financial statements and two years of selected financial data. We expect to lose emerging growth\ncompany status at the end of this year. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a “smaller reporting company”\nand/or “non-accelerated filer” which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including not being\nrequired to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive\ncompensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on\nthese exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our\nshare price may be more volatile.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware could make an acquisition of us more\ndifficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our\nmanagement. These provisions include a classified board of directors, a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders, and the ability of the\nBoard of Directors of the Company, or the Board, to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware,\nwe are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15%\nof the outstanding combined organization voting stock from merging or combining with the combined organization. Although we believe these provisions\ncollectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board, they would apply even if the\noffer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or\nremove then-current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the Board, which is responsible for appointing the\nmembers of management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for\ncertain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial\nforum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the\nState of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any of the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\nderivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers,\nemployees or agents to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate\nof incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or any action asserting a claim that is\n50\nTable of Contents\ngoverned by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as\ndefendants therein. This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, or any other claims for which a\ncourt or forum other than the Court of Chancery has exclusive jurisdiction or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction.\nFurthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state\nand federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that any person purchasing or\notherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our common stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our amended\nand restated certificate of incorporation.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our\ndirectors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an\naction, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in\npursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than\nwould other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such\njudgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. If a court were to find this exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated\ncertificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in any action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the\ndispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the near future and we may never achieve profitability.\nOur net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards generated in tax years beginning on or before December 31, 2017, are only permitted to be carried forward for\n20 years under applicable U.S. tax law. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as modified by the CARES Act, our federal NOLs generated in tax years beginning\nafter December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs is be limited to 80% of taxable income. In addition,\nunder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an\n“ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use\nits pre-change NOL, and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We have\nexperienced ownership changes in the past. We completed a review of our changes in ownership through December 31, 2022 and determined that we\nexperienced an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382(g) during the fourth quarter of 2022. This ownership change has and will continue to\nsubject our net operating loss carryforwards to an annual limitation, which will significantly restrict our ability to use them to offset our taxable income in\nperiods following the ownership change.\nWe determined that at the date of the 2022 ownership change, we had a net unrealized built-in loss (“NUBIL”). The NUBIL was determined based on the\ndifference between the fair market value of our assets and their tax basis at the ownership change date. Because of the NUBIL, certain deductions recognized\nduring the five-year period beginning on the date of the IRC Section 382 ownership change (the \"recognition period\") are subject to the same limitation as the\nnet operating loss carryforwards or certain other deductions.\nIn addition, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our\ncontrol. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to\nlimitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of\nNOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nFINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock due to our low stock price.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted rules requiring that, in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer\nmust have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative or low-priced securities to their\nnon-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment\nobjectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA has indicated its belief that there is a high\n51\nTable of Contents\nprobability that speculative or low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. If these FINRA requirements are applicable to us or our\nsecurities, which we believe they are, they may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that at least some of their customers buy our common\nstock, which may limit the ability of our stockholders to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market for and price of our\ncommon stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our\nstock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our\nbusiness. Our research coverage by securities and industry analysts is currently limited. In addition, because we did not become a reporting company by\nconducting an underwritten initial public offering of our common stock, security analysts of brokerage firms may not provide wider coverage of our Company.\nIn addition, investment banks may be less likely to agree to underwrite secondary offerings on our behalf than they might if we became a public reporting\ncompany by means of an underwritten initial public offering, because they may be less familiar with our Company as a result of more limited coverage by\nanalysts and the media, and because we became public at an early stage in our development. The failure to receive wider research coverage or support in the\nmarket for our shares will have an adverse effect on our ability to develop a liquid market for our common stock and the trading price for our stock would be\nnegatively impacted.\nIn the event we obtain wider securities or industry analyst coverage, if any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding\nus, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our target studies and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts,\nour stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in\nthe financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\n52\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

Reports Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results and Provides Corporate Update\n\n08/11/2023\n\nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Exicure, Inc. (Nasdaq: XCUR), has historically been an early-stage biotechnology company focused on developing nucleic acid therapies targeting ribonucleic acid against validated targets. In September 2022, the Company announced a significant reduction in force, suspension of preclinical activities and halting of all research and development, and that the Company was exploring strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. \n\n**Corporate Update**\n\nRecent highlights include: \n\n  * In May, the Company entered into two separate subscription agreements (“Subscription Agreements”) with Cyworld Z Co., Ltd., (“Cyworld Z”). Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, the Company purchased non-guaranteed private placement convertible bonds (“Bonds”) of Cyworld Z for a subscription amount of $1 million each. The Bonds mature in May 2026 and the yield to maturity is 4.5% per annum. \n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results**\n\n**_Cash Position_ :** Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $3.5 million as of June 30, 2023, as compared to $9.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents will fund its current operations into the fourth quarter of 2023. \n\n**_Research and Development (R &D) Expense_:** Research and development expenses were $0.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $6.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in R&D expense for the three months ended June 30, 2023 of $5.8 million reflects the suspension of clinical, preclinical, and discovery program activities and a reduction in employee headcount and fewer discovery, preclinical, and clinical program activities resulting from the restructuring activities that the Company announced in December 2021 and September 2022. \n\n**_General and Administrative (G &A) Expense_:** General and administrative expenses were $4.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $3.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The increase in G&A expense of $1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was mostly due to higher costs due to separation pay for executives and related stock based compensation expense, legal and consulting fees. \n\n**_Net Loss:_ ** The Company had a net loss of $5.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, as compared to a net loss of $7.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in net loss was primarily driven by significantly lower R&D expenses during the period. \n\n**_Going Concern:_ ** Management believes that the Company’s existing cash and cash equivalents will fund its operating expenses into the fourth quarter of 2023. However, this estimate is based on assumptions about how the Company can limit spending that may prove to be wrong. It is very difficult to project the Company’s current cash burn rate given the transitional status of the Company and this estimate may prove inaccurate. Depending on the direction of the Company’s review of strategic alternatives, the Company may use available resources sooner than management currently expects. The Company has already engaged in significant cost reductions, so our ability to further cut costs and extend the Company’s operating runway is limited. As a result, substantial additional financing will be needed by the Company within the next few months to pay expenses, fund the ongoing exploration of strategic alternatives and pursue any alternatives that may be identified. The Company seeks to raise capital in the third quarter of 2023 to fund its operations through 2024. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available and, if available, can be obtained on acceptable terms. \n\n**About Exicure**\n\nExicure, Inc. has historically been an early-stage biotechnology company focused on developing nucleic acid therapies targeting ribonucleic acid against validated targets. Following its recent restructuring and suspension of clinical and development activities, the Company is exploring strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value, both with respect to its historical biotechnology assets and more broadly.
