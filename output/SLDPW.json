Line installation remains on track to be completed in mid-2025, following which validation activities are expected to commence.\n  * Continued repeated electrolyte sampling to multiple customers and received constructive feedback, enabling electrolyte improvements.\n  * Extended the BMW JDA and will continue to jointly develop cell technologies.\n\n\n\n“The third quarter was successful on many fronts, with the major highlight being the validation we received from the DOE for our technology and business model, as we prepare to negotiate a grant for this exciting project that will expand our electrolyte production capabilities,” said John Van Scoter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Solid Power. “The team also started working in the EIC, which is a state-of-the-art electrolyte R&D and pre-pilot lab at SP2. We are excited about how the EIC will support and enable our electrolyte development and our ability to deliver electrolyte to meet our partners’ requirements.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nSolid Power delivered $4.7 million in revenue during the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $1.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. This decrease is primarily due to the timing of completing BMW JDA milestones in 2024. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $15.7 million, up $0.6 million from the same period in 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to timing and completion of milestones under the SK On agreements and execution on the BMW JDA. \n\nOperating expenses were higher in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared with the same periods in 2023, driven by increased production costs, cell and electrolyte development costs, scaling of operations, and execution under joint development agreements. Third quarter 2024 operating loss was $27.6 million and net loss was $22.4 million, or $0.13 per share. **Balance Sheet and Liquidity**\n\nSolid Power’s liquidity position remains strong. Total liquidity as of September 30, 2024, was $348.1 million, as shown below.\n\n**(in thousands)**| **September 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 37,969| $| 34,537  \nMarketable securities| 94,041| 141,505  \nInvestments| 216,062| 239,566  \n**Total liquidity**|  $| 348,072| $| 415,608  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, contract receivables were $2.6 million, deferred revenue was $6.7 million, and total current liabilities were $20.3 million.\n\nThird quarter and year-to-date 2024 capital expenditures totaled $2.7 million and $11.2 million, respectively. This primarily represents investments in the company’s electrolyte production capabilities, including the build-out of the EIC.\n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\nSolid Power remains committed to delivering on the following key objectives for 2024:\n\n  * Expand electrolyte capabilities and available market through increased production and a robust sampling program,\n  * Advance cell designs to A-2 Sample specifications,\n  * Execute on key milestones and commitments to our joint development partners, and\n  * Strengthen Korea presence and embed Solid Power into the Korean battery ecosystem.\n\n\n\nThe company continues to expect 2024 revenue to be in the range of $16 million to $20 million, with total cash investment expected to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million. Total cash investment is comprised of cash used in operations in the range of $60 million to $70 million and capital expenditures in the range of $40 million to $50 million.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call**\n\nSolid Power will host a conference call at 2:30 p.m. MT (4:30 p.m. ET) today, November 7, 2024. Participating on the call will be John Van Scoter, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Linda Heller, Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThe call may be accessed through a live audio webcast on Solid Power’s Investor Relations website at [www.solidpowerbattery.com/investor-relations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hQtfbPMzXZFvQemUGnr0QRfjwi2qLVKJKvv1fWcAi6qUF2lcAIzqcEAtpkAfjB4_MFeh-Dngf6RKIycRlxTQRoqvg1ClAqqgQYUjE_u4VmxTCEN3jDekvyn6OlfTtg7SPfaah-xVh3X9PtYrJV6aKPIRzoQXtmg1xXdp0e4ixOw=).

With this project, Solid Power intends to install the first globally known continuous manufacturing process of sulfide-based solid electrolyte materials for advanced all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) and expand its electrolyte production capabilities at its Thornton, CO facility. The expansion is designed to further the Company’s technology roadmap and support anticipated small volume programs of current and future customers as they begin to transition from traditional lithium-ion to ASSB technology.\n\nSolid Power’s leading sulfide-based solid electrolyte material is a key component to enable the anticipated performance advances of ASSBs, including improvements in energy density, safety, high-temperature stability, and cost. Solid Power currently has the capability to produce 30 metric tons of electrolyte per year. Through this multi-year capital improvement project, Solid Power plans to significantly increase its annual production capacity, first to 75 metric tons in 2026 and then to 140 metric tons in 2028, in order to meet anticipated demand. In addition, Solid Power expects the continuous manufacturing process will allow it to produce electrolyte at a significantly lower cost, compared to today’s process.\n\n“We view our selection for funding by the U.S. Department of Energy as validation of the promise sulfide-based all-solid-state batteries hold,” said John Van Scoter, President and Chief Executive Officer of Solid Power. “By adopting a continuous manufacturing process for our electrolyte, we expect to be able to meet anticipated near-term demand and set Solid Power up to become the leading global producer of sulfide-based solid electrolyte.”\n\nOver the course of the project, Solid Power expects to hire up to 40 full-time employees for manufacturing operations at its Thornton, CO facility, and its contractors/subcontractors expect to employ union labor for up to 100 construction positions for this endeavor. The project demonstrates the Company’s strong commitment to local communities.\n\nThe Company does not anticipate any DOE funding to have a material impact on its financial outlook for this fiscal year, which it last provided on August 6, 2024.\n\n**About Solid Power, Inc.** Solid Power is developing solid-state battery technology to enable the next generation of batteries for the fast-growing EV and other markets. Solid Power’s core technology is its electrolyte material, which Solid Power believes can enable extended driving range, longer battery life, improved safety, and lower cost compared to traditional lithium-ion.

Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference\nCall.\nAt this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions\nduring the question-and-answer session. You may register to ask a question at any time by pressing star,\none on your touchtone phone. You may withdraw yourself from the queue by pressing star, two. Please\nnote this call may be recorded. I will be standing by should you need any assistance.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Melanie Solomon, Investor Relations.\nMelanie Solomon\nThank you, Operator.\nWelcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\nI'm joined on today's call by Solid Power's President and Chief Executive Officer, John Van Scoter and\nChief Financial Officer, Linda Heller.\nA copy of today's earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of Solid Power's website\nwww.solidpowerbattery.com.\n0\nI'd like to remind you that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined\nby U.S. Securities Laws. These forward-looking statements are based on Management's current\nexpectations and assumptions about future events and are based on currently available information as to\nthe outcome and timing of future events. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, Solid Power\ndisclaims any duty to update any forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.\nFor a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\nexpressed in today's forward-looking statements, please see Solid Power's most recent filings with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, which can be found on the Company's website at\nwww.solidpowerbattery.com.\nWith that, let me turn it over to John Van Scoter.\nJohn Van Scoter\nThank you, Melanie, and thank you all for joining us.\nWe accomplished a lot in the third quarter and I'm excited to share our progress with you today. A major\nhighlight of the quarter was the U.S. Department of Energy's announcement that we were selected to\nnegotiate a $50 million grant for a project focused on continuous production of sulfide-based solid\nelectrolyte materials for Advanced All Solid State Batteries or ASSBs. The process was highly competitive,\nand we view our selection as a validation of our technology and business model. We thank the DOE for its\nfaith in Solid Power.\nWide adoption of EVs in the United States will require continued advancement of battery technologies,\nincluding the materials that support that advancement. We believe our sulfide cell and electrolyte can offer\na step function increase in battery performance compared to conventional lithium-ion. While performance\nis critical, so is the ability to efficiently manufacture and process our product.\nAs we continue to innovate on electrolyte performance, based on feedback from partners and potential\ncustomers, we also need to demonstrate that our electrolyte can be manufactured on a high volume and\nhigh-quality basis. To do so, we will need to shift from our current batch production to a continuous\nmanufacturing process. Over the next 12 to 18 months, the team is planning to install the first globally\nknown pilot line that can continuously manufacture sulfide-based cell and electrolyte materials for ASSBs.\nThe first pilot line we are planning to install has been part of our overall electrolyte technology development\nroadmap.\nWe expect that by using a continuous manufacturing process, we will have better control of the final\nelectrolyte product and a greater ability to tailor our electrolyte to a customer's requirements. As an added\nbenefit, following Phase one of the project we expect to be able to produce 75 metric tons of electrolyte per\nyear to support our customer development programs. Our projection is that Phase 1 will be completed in\n2026. After finishing the full project, projected to be in 2028, we expect to have the capability to produce\n140 metric tons per year at SP2, which is more than four times our current capability.\nLast month, shortly following the DOE's announcement, we hosted Colorado Governor, Jared Polis, and\nDeputy Secretary of the Department of Energy, David Turk. We gave them a tour of our electrolyte facility\nand showed them how we plan to deploy the DOE funds in a continuous manufacturing process. Deputy\nSecretary David Turk spoke about the DOE's rigorous selection process and the criteria used to select\ncompanies for grants.\nSolid Power satisfied their three main criteria. First, having a strong technology and business model.\nSecond, addressing challenges in the U.S. supply chain for clean energy by producing battery cells\ndomestically. Third, improving our surrounding communities by hiring locally to staff this project. We're\n1\nthrilled to have the validation and support of the federal government and our local community here in\nThornton, and look forward to undergoing negotiations for the grant.\nThe next step in the DOE process will be to negotiate a contract for the grant funding. We expect that will\ntake several months and we will provide updates when we are able to.\nAnother highlight of the quarter was beginning development activities in our state-of-the-art Electrolyte\nInnovation Center or EIC. The EIC was designed to significantly enhance our research and development\ncapabilities, and improve pre-pilot electrolyte manufacturing processes. The EIC will allow us to focus on\nsmaller scale electrolyte development and pre-pilot manufacturing processes, before transferring our\nprocesses to pilot scale manufacturing.\nThe EIC will enable speed and flexibility, emulating a full process on a smaller scale. The work we do in the\nEIC will help us customize electrolyte for customers' needs and enhance our feedback loop between our\nelectrolyte and cell development programs. This pre-pilot continuous flow process and equipment\ndevelopment will also be a precursor to the work we expect to do under the BIL grant and increase our\nconfidence in executing that program. I'm very excited about the potential EIC gives us, as we continue to\nposition Solid Power as a leader in the sulfide electrolyte space.\nMoving on to electrolyte sampling, we continue to sample multiple customers on a repeat basis, with\nmultiple variants and we have received constructive feedback. As we iterate our products, we believe we\nare well positioned to react quickly to our customers' requirements. While the total addressable market is\nlarge, the number of customers within is finite. As we have said before, we believe many EV OEMs and\nTier 1 battery producers have sulfide-based solid-state products in their future roadmap. Of this group, we\nare now actively sampling a substantial portion. The feedback from sampling is providing important\nlearnings as we continue to evolve our technology. As I mentioned with our new EIC, we can rapidly adapt\nand adjust to meet their needs.\nOn the cell side, we've made significant progress on our A-2 cell design this year. In order to address gaps,\nwe identified with the A-1 design the team has been hard at work to improve the design of our cathode\nanode and separator for the A-2. These are not major chemistry changes. Rather, we are tweaking and\nenhancing the current design in our pursuit of higher performance.\nIn addition, the team has made some mechanical improvements to the lines with the goal of higher quality\ncell builds. The work is continuing on these efforts, and I believe they will provide notable improvements\nfrom our A-1 design, especially around safety and energy density. We have begun small production runs\nof our A-2 material set for internal testing and expect to begin testing A-2 cells in early 2025.\nAs I segue to our progress with partners, I want to note two things I am excited about. First, the feedback\nloop we have created is fueling our technology development with sampling and customer response as key\ncomponents. Second, our cell technology will soon be in development on three continents through our work\nwith BMW in Europe and SK On in Asia, broadening our reach and depth of experience globally. With BMW\nin the third quarter, we finalized the JDA extension as we continue to collaborate with them on cell\ndevelopment and manufacturing. The overall goal of the JDA remains what it has always been, to develop\na competitive solid-state battery technology that can be used in an automotive application.\nWe continue to drive performance around A-2 in our overall roadmap to achieve a product that meets\nBMW's exacting standards prior to vehicle integration. We are laser-focused on continuing to develop our\ncell technologies prior to BMW bringing online its pilot line in Parsdorf, Germany next year. We value our\npartnership with BMW and continue to enjoy the collaborative nature and beneficial feedback loop.\nWith SK On we remain on track with our agreements and have already met all of the required milestones\nfor the year. The line drop and tech transfer are going well, and we expect to send electrolyte to Korea this\nquarter to support factory acceptance activities ahead of planned line installation in mid-2025.\n2\nAdditionally, during the third quarter we signed a non-binding MoU with a major battery manufacturer to\nexplore the possibility of an electrolyte JDA. While it is very early in this engagement, if we successfully\nadvance to an agreement, it would be our first electrolyte-specific JDA. We expect such a collaboration\nwould give us as valuable feedback and insights into the electrolyte design and development.\nWe are continuing to deepen relationships across Korean battery landscape by collaborating with Korean\nresearch institutes such as Korea Electronics Technology Institute and Korea Evaluation Institute of\nIndustrial Technology. We have entered into several agreements to leverage the Korean ecosphere on\nmaterials and battery performance and are excited by what we can learn from these new relationships. We\nexpect these collaborations to advance our understanding of market needs while expanding our network in\nKorea as we benefit from the talent and experience of these leading institutions.\nOverall, I'm pleased with the progress in the third quarter and excited about our momentum as we exit the\nyear and move into 2025.\nI will now turn the call over to Linda to review our financials. Linda?\nLinda Heller\nThank you, John.\nI'll start with Q3 results beginning with revenue. Solid Power delivered $4.7 million in revenue during the\nthird quarter of 2024 primarily driven by continued execution on the SK On agreements and government\ncontracts. Operating expenses were $32.2 million driven by increased production costs, cell and electrolyte\ndevelopment costs, scaling of operations and execution under our joint development agreement. Operating\nloss was $27.6 million and net loss was $22.4 million or $0.13 per share.\nCapital expenditures totaled $2.7 million during the quarter primarily representing investments in the\nelectrolyte production capabilities including the build-out of the EIC. Solid Power's liquidity position remains\nstrong with $348.1 million of total liquidity as of September 30, 2024. In addition, accounts receivable totaled\n$2.6 million, deferred revenue was $6.7 million, while total current liabilities were $20.3 million. As John\nmentioned, we have already achieved our SK On milestones for the year. We expected $14.9 million in\nprogress payments in 2024 which have already been collected. For 2024, we are reiterating the guidance\nwe provided on the last call which may also be found in the press release we issued today.\nAs a reminder and point of clarification, the Department of Energy award is a grant, not a loan, for funding\nof up to $50 million. The total estimated project cost is $110 million and we are dedicating $60 million over\na multiyear period. The $50 million grant represents a potential offset of our plans, not an incremental\ninvestment expense. We are well positioned to execute our strategy, and I'm excited about the Company's\nplans.\nI'll now turn it back to John for closing comments before we take your questions.\nJohn Van Scoter\nThank you, Linda.\nIn closing I'm pleased to reiterate that the Company remains on track to achieve our goals for 2024. I would\nlike to thank our employees, our partners and stakeholders for their loyalty and dedication. We have been\nplanning an analyst and Investor event to showcase our technology strategy and long-term model. As the\nteam will be focused on negotiating the BIL grant over the next few months, we believe that negotiation and\nfurther progress on our strategy will better position us for an exciting event in the first half of 2025.\n3\nOverall, I am encouraged by our progress as we continue to focus on improvement of electrolyte and cell\nperformance.\nWe will now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator\nThank you. At this time if you would like to ask a question, please press star, one on your telephone keypad.\nYou may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star, two. Again, that is star, one to ask\na question. We will pause for just a moment to allow questions to queue.\nOur first question will be from Mike with D.A. Davidson.\nMichael Shlisky\nHi. Hey everybody, it's Mike Shlisky, D.A. Davidson. How are you?\nJohn Van Scoter\nGood, Mike. Good to hear your voice.\nMichael Shlisky\nYes, same here. A couple of quick ones from me. One, the ASSB grants award that you just mentioned,\ncan you just give us a little insight as to how that's going to work? Is it a competitive process? Are you up\nagainst other companies for this grant? If they give the DOE the best deal, are you already selected, and it\njust comes down to some minor details? I guess I'll make sure I understand the likelihood of the grant\ncoming through for close to the amount that you've been talking about at least.\nJohn Van Scoter\nSure. The process started late last year to make a proposal to the DOE under the Bipartisan Infrastructure\nLegislation. We actually submitted the formal proposal in March of this year. We then were invited back to\ndefend that proposal in Washington D.C. in front of a skilled panel in the DOE facility. It was 1.5 hours, kind\nof like a thesis defense if you will. We were allowed five people to attend that. They peppered us with\nquestions on all of the major areas the technology, the business model the viability of the supply chain\ndomestically and then the community benefits program.\nThe best knowledge that we have, and this is actually through a lobbyist that we use in Washington D.C.,\nwas again it was very highly competitive and there were 25 total awards that were given and about 10%\nwere actually awarded of the proposals that were put in, to the best of our knowledge. In our specific\ncategory it was even more selective and about 5% of proposals were actually granted. That's an overview\nof how the proposal process went and then the selective nature of the grants. Did that address the question,\nMike?\nMichael Shlisky\nYes. I just wanted to follow-up. Assuming the grant money does come through in the reasonable near\nfuture, does it represent funding of the plan that you've already had in place all along? Or is this a bit of a\nbranching out, a different initiative that would require some brand new funding? I'm trying to find if the cash\nyou have on hand will just be bolstered by this additional grant funding, and would you have been fine\nwithout it?\nJohn Van Scoter\n4\nIt's the former, Mike. In fact, we had this in our plan. This is essentially, a cash offset for what we had\nplanned to spend. As with any DOE program, it is a cost share program. We will have to put $60 million in\nfor the project. The total project spend will be $110 million, to get to the continuous flow operation, over the\ncourse of the next three-plus years.\nMichael Shlisky\nOkay. I do have other questions, but maybe I'll just throw out one more question for you, that's somewhat\nrelated. We just had an election in the United States, a couple of days ago as you know and the President-\nelect coming in seems to be a bit less enthusiastic about the electric vehicle world, than maybe prior\nadministrations was. I want to make sure I'm clear that this particular grant and even your customers' ability\nand desire to even pursue further EV platforms is still relatively intact after the changeover in January.\nJohn Van Scoter\nYes. We really can't speculate on how things are going to play out, relative to the new administration, Mike.\nI think time will tell on that. We just remain focused on our strategy, solving for longer range, lower cost and\nsafer EVs. We believe that's what the market is looking for. Some of the softness that is out there right now\nwith the current EVs, I believe, are caused by inadequacies in those areas. We're focused on our strategy\nand executing our strategy and believe that it will be a winner in the long run.\nMichael Shlisky\nAll right. Okay. I’ll leave it there. Thanks so much for the discussion.\nJohn Van Scoter\nThank you, Mike.\nOperator\nThank you. Again, as a quick reminder if you'd like to ask a question, please press star, one now. I'm\nshowing no additional questions at this time. I'd like to now turn the conference over to our presenters for\nany closing remarks.\nJohn Van Scoter\nThank you for joining the call today and for your interest in Solid Power. Linda and I look forward to updating\nyou next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect.\n5"
