However, to date, gene therapy successes have been limited to rare, monogenic recessive diseases. With innovation and vision, AAV-based genetic medicines have the potential to treat large market, complex diseases that affect hundreds of thousands of patients every year. To achieve this vision, our industry must learn lessons from the development of past and current AAV-based gene therapies. These lessons can be used to direct cutting-edge innovation to overcome hurdles with current vector systems. This gives us, as an industry, the opportunity to unlock the full potential of AAV vector-based genetic medicines for countless patients with complex diseases.\n\n## The Emergence of Gene Therapy as a Treatment Modality: Promise Followed by Disappointment\n\nThe original application of traditional gene therapy several decades ago was focused on rare monogenic diseases. Examples included the treatment of patients with severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID) with retrovirus-based therapeutics, as well as monogenic liver disorders (e.g. ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, or OTC deficiency) with adenovirus vectors. While promising clinical activity was demonstrated in each case, these first-generation vectors resulted in significant toxicities. In the case of retrovirus-based therapeutics for hematologic diseases such as SCID, gene therapy treatment ex vivo led to leucocyte proliferative disorders and even leukemias in some cases. Adenovirus vector toxicities were generally related to high levels of inflammation due to the virus itself, including severe hepatotoxicity with intravenous administration. In addition to these limitations of the vector systems used, another challenge during this era was the application to complex large market diseases such as cancer; these diseases were unlikely to be cured with delivery of a single transgene product.\n\nThese pioneering but ill-fated programs advanced the field by demonstrating the potential of gene replacement therapy. However, these products also made it clear that safer and less inflammatory vectors were needed. These results set the stage for the emergence of AAV vectors as the preferred delivery vehicles for in vivo treatment of non-proliferative tissues.\n\n## AAV Gene Therapy 1.0\n\nThe discovery that the capsid of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) could be used as a vector to deliver a transgene cassette revolutionized in vivo gene therapy. Lentivirus vectors had the same impact on ex vivo gene therapy and cell therapy with hematopoietic stem cells; these viruses were able to insert safely into the genome (without causing leukemias) of target proliferative cells and therefore sustain transgene expression despite cellular dividing and proliferation. For in vivo gene therapy, AAV vectors were found to be less immunogenic than\n\nadenovirus, and they did not have the high risk of insertional mutagenesis associated with retroviruses. With a carrying capacity of approximately 4.7 KB, these vectors had the potential to deliver a therapeutic transgene together with a promoter sequence to drive high-level transgene expression.\n\nHowever, the lack of insertion into the genome limited these treatments to non-proliferative tissues such as the retina, other neurologic tissue (e.g. brain, spinal cord, or dorsal root ganglia) and to a lesser extent the liver. Hematologic or gastrointestinal diseases were therefore not treatable with these AAV vectors; tissue targets were therefore limited to stable and relatively non-proliferative tissues. In addition, the capsid size constraints limited delivery of transgenes based on size; delivery of large genes such as microdystrophin or full-length cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) were not feasible. For large transgenes that did not fit into AAV vectors, transgene innovations were used to design and construct truncated but functional protein sequences that fit into the AAV capsid. Finally, the naturally occurring wildtype AAV capsids available were inefficient at target cell transduction in many cases, and they were not targeted for delivery to target tissues by routine routes of administration.\n\nThe initial successful AAV-based gene therapy products were therefore designed and developed for monogenic recessive diseases, with transgenes that fit into AAV (i.e. --\n\nWhile these early proof of concept AAV-based products had profound impacts on patient outcomes in some cases, these products also demonstrated the limitations with first generation AAV gene therapy products and vectors. Given the difficult and inefficient routes of administration for extrahepatic tissues such as the retina or skeletal muscle, these conventional AAV vectors are not feasible delivery vehicles for gene therapy products addressing large market diseases that impact hundreds of thousands of patients per year. In addition, the inefficient delivery and transduction with these vectors has led to relatively high doses with high cost of goods that are not acceptable for large market diseases.\n\n## AAV Gene Therapy 2.0: AAV-based Genetic Medicines\n\nDespite the success of these products for niche, rare monogenic diseases, the need for better AAV vectors has become increasingly clear over time. The field needs vectors that are more efficient at transducing specific cell types, and vectors that are more efficiently delivered at low and safe doses by routine routes of administration clinically (e.g. intravenous, aerosol, or intravitreal). In addition, pre-existing anti-AAV antibodies has led to the exclusion of up to 50% of patients on clinical trials as well. Vectors that do not cross react with pre-existing antibodies in the population are therefore an attractive feature of any new target vector profile. With targeted vectors delivered by routine routes of administration, the safety and immunogenicity of these products should be superior to first generation products. Cost-of-goods (COGs) should also be more attractive, especially for large market diseases.\n\nTwo general approaches have been identified for the invention of superior AAV vectors. First, rational design approaches were utilized to identify vectors with superior trafficking to the nucleus of target cells (e.g. tyrosine mutants). In addition, GH loop modifications have been made to reduce binding and inhibition by pre-existing antibodies in the population. However, the limitation of these rational design features is that they each address a single step in a very complex and multi-step process from a vector leaving a physician’s needle and getting all the way to the nucleus of target cells within a particular tissue.\n\nIn contrast to rational design, directed evolution has the potential to correct and optimize multiple steps in the journey of a therapeutic capsid from needle to nucleus. Briefly, directed evolution is a Nobel Prize-winning technology that allows humans to leverage the power of evolution to create novel bespoke biologics. In the case of AAV, the capsid can be diversified in order to generate billions of potential synthetic AAV capsids. In vivo iterative selection can then be used to identify the synthetic AAV capsid with the best match to the investigator’s target vector profile. These selections are best done in non-human primates in order to increase the likelihood of translation into humans. In addition, in order to increase the likelihood of success in humans, selections can be performed in parallel or sequentially on human cells and/or human organotypic tissues. Finally, through exposure of the vector library to pools of antibodies from the human population (e.g. human IV-Ig), investigators can identify vectors that meet the target vector profile and simultaneously, are relatively resistant to pre-existing antibodies in the human population. Therefore, more patients can be enrolled and treated on clinical trials and after marketing approval.\n\nDirected evolution has been utilized to invent customized capsid vectors for a variety of tissues. These include intravitreal retinotropic vectors for delivery to the retina, aerosol delivered vectors for the lung airways, and low dose intravenous vectors targeting extrahepatic tissues such as the heart. While products utilizing these novel, customized and evolved vectors have yet to be approved for general use, they hold the potential to enable treatment of large market disease indications where safety, COGs, and routine administration are paramount.\n\n## Future Directions Beyond AAV Vectors: Non-Viral Nanoparticles and Oncolytic Viruses\n\nThe future of AAV-based genetic medicines is bright. Transformative gene therapy medicines for rare monogenic recessive diseases have been approved, including Zolgensma (for spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA), Luxturna (for Leber congenital amaurosis type 2, or LCA2, and other conditions due to _RPE_ gene mutation) and Hemgenix (for hemophilia B). In addition, next generation AAV-based genetic medicines are being developed for large market diseases such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), diabetic macular edema, inflammation, and cancer.\n\nNevertheless, hurdles still exist for next generation optimized AAV-based medicines. First, while AAV capsids can be invented that do not cross react with pre-existing immunity, and these can be combined with sophisticated immunosuppressive regimens, anti-AAV capsid immunity will nevertheless arise in most patients following treatment; repeat dosing may therefore be challenging for tissues that turn over and lose gene expression over time. Second, the transgene carrying capacity of AAV is limited by its physical shape and size. Larger transgene cassettes, such as are required for full length microdystrophin or most CRISPR/Cas-based gene editing constructs, are therefore currently not deliverable with AAV vectors. Finally, since AAV does not genetically modify nor integrate into the DNA of the target cell, AAV-based genetic medicines will not lead to durable gene expression in highly proliferative tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract or hematopoietic stem cells.\n\nNext generation delivery systems for genetic medicines are therefore needed. Non-viral transgene delivery systems include polymers, lipids (e.g. liposomes), peptides, and hybrid lipid nanoparticles (LNP). Approved genetic medicines utilizing LNP delivery vehicles to the liver include Onpattro (patisiran, siRNA inhibiting transthyretin translation for ATTR) and Leqvio (inclisiran, siRNA inhibiting PCSK9 translation for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia). Pegylated LNP vectors for RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines were hugely successful and transformative for society.\n\nNon-viral delivery systems have the advantage of being less immunogenic, allowing for the potential of redosing. In addition, non-viral gene delivery systems may have larger transgene payload carrying capacities. With larger payload carrying capacities, gene editing within diverse and large market patient populations may become increasingly feasible over time. These non-viral delivery vehicles can also be “decorated” by PEG or targeting proteins such as antibodies.\n\nThe downside of these systems remains the inefficient transduction of cells overall, with highly inefficient trafficking to the nucleus (as is required for DNA based therapeutics). In addition, delivery and transduction with these systems is not targeted generally, except for liver-directed particles. Gene delivery systems for targeting extrahepatic tissue are needed for the treatment of most large market diseases.\n\nOncology applications require differentiated delivery systems. Given the need to treat systemic, metastatic cancer deposits, and because cancer cells proliferate and mutate over time, standard replication deficient AAV or non-viral vector systems are unlikely to be successful. Replication-selective oncolytic virus vectors are an attractive alternative for the treatment of metastatic cancers. These viral vectors are engineered to replicate selectively within cancer cells, while their replication and gene expression is blocked in normal cells. Several different strategies have been utilized to generate tumor selectivity. First, gene deletion mutants have been engineered for cancer selectivity by deleting viral genes that are necessary for replication in normal cells, whereas these same viral genes are expendable for replication in tumor cells. Examples include deletion of the thymidine kinase gene in vaccinia virus or herpes virus, and deletion of E1A gene regions (e.g. conserved region 2) or the E1B-55k gene in adenovirus. Another approach is to use cancer-specific promoters to drive critical genes for viral replication in cancer cells selectively.\n\nTo maximize efficacy for metastatic cancers, beyond what results from viral replication and associated cancer cell death alone, these oncolytic viral vectors are commonly engineered to express additional anti-cancer gene products. These “armed” oncolytic viruses can be engineered to express various immunostimulatory transgene products to generate an “off the shelf” patient-specific cancer vaccine; these agents hold great promise in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody therapies (e.g. PD-1 inhibitors). These agents can also express transgenes to enhance tumor cell sensitivity to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Armed oncolytic viruses hold great potential for the multi-mechanistic treatment of patients with metastatic cancers.\n\nIn summary, the future of genetic medicine and gene therapy is extremely bright. Innovations in the design and engineering of vectors, transgenes, and promoter elements are revolutionizing the field. Customized immunomodulatory regimens are also enhancing the safety, efficacy, and re-dosing feasibility of gene therapy. These innovations will expand the potential of gene therapy to hundreds of thousands of patients with large market, complex diseases.\n\n**About the Author**\n\n![](https://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/4dd89941/4dd89941-2640-4b06-ac9d-628169bfeced/david_kirn_01.jpg)David Kirn, M.D., is co-founder and CEO of 4D Molecular Therapeutics (4DMT), a clinical-stage biopharma company inventing and developing innovative products to unlock the full potential of genetic medicine to treat large market diseases.

That leaves 6% of patients hanging.\n\n_Pictured: a young boy with an oxygen mask/_[_iStock_](https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-pneumonia-bronchitis-allergy-asthma-copd-tb-gm1215990119-354400982?phrase=cystic+fibrosis) _, Anastasia Dobrusina_\n\nVertex’s four FDA-approved cystic fibrosis drugs—once authorized for people of all ages—can potentially treat the underlying cause of disease in up to 94% of patients, according to [The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation](https://www.cff.org/), a non-profit devoted to curing the disease. This leaves 6% of patients with an unmet need. \n\nA genetic disease, cystic fibrosis (CF), [is caused](https://www.cff.org/intro-cf/about-cystic-fibrosis) by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, resulting in insufficient or defective CFTR protein in cells. People with CF inherit two mutated copies of the CFTR gene, one from each parent. Lack of a well-functioning CFTR chloride channel makes mucus thick and sticky, which can clog airways and lead to infection, inflammation, respiratory failure, and death.\n\nThe currently available CF drugs, called CFTR modulators, are designed to bind to and correct aberrant CFTR protein, said Jennifer Taylor-Cousar, who treats cystic fibrosis in adults and children at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado and co-authored a 2023 [review article](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-med-042921-021447?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed) on modulator therapies. \n\n[](#image-b50000) ![Jennifer Taylor-Cousar](https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/cb8bc1f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/178x237+36+0/resize/375x500!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2F8EFD66F3-DAE2-4CE7-9DB5-AB4CFADAD05D.jpg)\n\nJennifer Taylor-Cousar\n\nOne type of CFTR modulator called a corrector, binds to CFTR and improves protein processing, folding and transport to the cell membrane. Another type, potentiators, lengthen the time the CFTR ion channel spends in its open position so that more ions can pass through.\n\nThe Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) estimates that about 6% of CF patients do not produce any CFTR protein, leaving them without an approved treatment.\n\n“[Those patients] do not make any CFTR protein, and so there’s no protein to correct, and there’s no protein to potentiate,” Heather Clark, head of program management at [ReCode Therapeutics](https://www.biospace.com/employer/399086/recode-therapeutics/), told _BioSpace_.\n\nTo treat these remaining patients, companies employ three primary approaches to help cells make CFTR. Jane Davies, professor of Pediatric Respirology & Experimental Medicine at Imperial College London’s National Heart and Lung Institute, told _BioSpace_.\n\nSome, including Vertex and ReCode, are developing messenger RNA (mRNA) treatments that lung cells can use to make functional CFTR proteins. Others, including 4DMT, are developing gene therapies to introduce working versions of the CFTR gene into cells’ nuclei. ReCode is also working on gene-editing-based treatments.\n\nGene-editing approaches to treating CF are still in the pre-clinical stages, said Davies, who has advised and led clinical trials of Vertex CFTR modulators and also advised ReCode. \n\n## mRNA Therapy\n\nmRNA therapies aim to treat CF by giving cells the mRNA template to produce their own CFTR, ReCode CEO Shehnaaz Suliman told _BioSpace_. To target the lungs, ReCode’s experimental mRNA therapy is delivered by inhalation and packaged in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) that includes an additional lipid molecule to direct the LNP to the lungs, Suliman said. ReCode does this with its [SORT (selective organ targeting) lipid](https://recodetx.com/science/). \n\n[](#image-d50000) ![Shehnaaz Suliman](https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/24c47c6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/230x306+8+0/resize/375x500!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2FBA022F83-69F8-4E89-8DC0-EB6A764B3CB1.jpg)\n\nShehnaaz Suliman\n\nJennifer Leahy\n\nVertex is also working on an inhaled mRNA treatment for CF, [VX-522](https://www.biospace.com/article/vertex-and-splisense-tackle-cf-with-novel-inhaled-mrna-approaches/), developed through a 2016 collaboration with Moderna. Vertex began enrolling adults with CFTR variants who don’t respond to modulators in a [Phase I clinical trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05668741) in February.\n\nThe main distinction between the two approaches is that ReCode’s candidate is packaged in LNPs containing SORT lipids, Suliman said, adding that the primary advantage here lies in the ability to take a traditional four-component LNP—which is the one that’s used in the Vertex-Moderna program—and attach the SORT lipid. Vertex declined to comment on ReCode’s programs. \n\n## Gene Therapy and Editing\n\nGene therapy approaches to CF involve introducing the correct CFTR gene into cells’ nuclei, usually using a viral vector, Taylor-Cousar said. Some gene therapies integrate the functioning gene into the genome, while others do not.\n\n4DMT’s experimental gene therapy, 4D-710, consists of the CFTR gene contained within an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. The company used directed evolution in primates to develop a viral capsid that could penetrate the mucus in the lungs to reach target cells, David Kirn, CEO, told _BioSpace_. He added that the directed evolution of AAV involves generating mutations in the capsid genes to create a library of capsid variants, selecting the variants with desired properties and repeating this process as needed. \n\n[](#image-980000) ![David Kirn](https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/a1aa2b5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/230x307+10+0/resize/375x500!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2F4E237551-E2F5-495C-B3DE-13028C15577B.jpg)\n\nDavid Kirn\n\nJim Gensheimer/Jim Gensheimer\n\nAfter entering the target cell, the capsid delivers the CFTR DNA to the nucleus, which remains as a circular piece of DNA, or episome, outside the host genome. When the cell divides, the episome DNA is not replicated, Kirn said. Because of this, as cells transduced with the therapy divide or die, the transgene will be diluted and eventually lost, according to a 2017 AAV-based gene therapy [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5548848/#:~:text=Because%20recombinant%20episomal,the%20transduced%20cell.). How long such a therapy lasts depends on how quickly cells are replaced.\n\n“In the lung, the turnover is slow. But we don’t know whether we’re going to want to re-dose in two years or three years or five years,” Kirn said. 4D-710 is currently being studied in a Phase I/II [clinical trial](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05248230).\n\nInterim results from the first three patients, [presented](https://ir.4dmoleculartherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/4d-molecular-therapeutics-announces-interim-clinical-data-phase) at the 2022 North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference, revealed that the inhaled gene therapy was expressed in multiple lung cell types, including basal cells, Kirn said, explaining that basal cells are the lung’s stem cells and can differentiate into other lung cell types. \n\nReCode is also working on a gene-edited therapy for CF. This approach, which the company calls gene correction, could theoretically treat any patient with CF, not just those who make CFTR protein since gene editing can potentially correct any mutation. \n\n[](#image-5a0000) ![Heather Clark](https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/6e9723e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/213x284+19+0/resize/375x500!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2F33EC4431-4B56-425F-BC94-044EC6EF5167.jpg)\n\nHeather Clark\n\n“We envision that as a therapy that could impact all patients,” ReCode’s Clark said.\n\nAs for which gene editing tool ReCode might use, Suliman named base editing, prime editing, DNA nucleases and CRISPR/Cas9 as potential options. \n\n## Best Approach?\n\nWhich approach is likely to work best depends partly on how “best” is defined, said Taylor-Cousar, who has received grants and consulting fees from Vertex. “There’s a difference in what will be most effective and what’s most expedient,” she said.\n\nBecause of the experience gained during the COVID-19 pandemic, Taylor-Cousar said mRNA therapies will likely reach the market more quickly.\n\nFor patients without treatment, time is of the essence, even if all the drug can do is keep them stable while they wait for a better treatment, she said. “If we could stabilize people who aren’t eligible or can’t tolerate modulators, that would be fantastic.”\n\nBut mRNA therapies only reach the cells at the surface of the airways, and those cells turn over fairly quickly, as does mRNA itself, Taylor-Cousar said. For those reasons, she said patients will likely need to take inhaled mRNA therapies every day or every other day to have a sustained response.\n\nGene therapies, in contrast, can reach basal cells, which turn over much more slowly, so their benefits will last longer than mRNA therapies, Taylor-Cousar added. The effects of non-integrating gene therapies, like 4D-710, are still [not permanent](https://www.cff.org/research-clinical-trials/gene-therapy-cystic-fibrosis#types-of-gene-therapy-non-integrating-vs-integrating:~:text=that%20it%20is-,not%20permanent.,-The%20effect%20of). Taylor-Cousar has consulted for 4DMT and is the principal investigator of the National Jewish Health site of a clinical trial of 4DMT’s experimental gene therapy.\n\nReCode’s Suliman said a downside of gene therapies is that they elicit an immune response to the viral vector. After the gene therapy is administered, the immune system produces neutralizing antibodies against the capsid proteins, according to an AAV gene therapy [review](https://www.cell.com/trends/biotechnology/fulltext/S0167-7799\\(22\\)00303-1#:~:text=essentially%20acting%20as%20a%20vaccine%20against%20re%2Dadministration%20of%20the%20therapy%20if%20required%20and%20reducing%20the%20therapeutic%20transduction%20efficiency.) published in the June edition of _Trends in Biotechnology_.\n\nThis “is a major limitation to repeated dosing,” Imperial College London’s Davies added. Those neutralizing antibodies, created after dose one, are primed to destroy the gene therapy if it is administered a second time, according to the AAV review.\n\n4DMT’s Kirn said that 4D-710 avoided that problem by selecting a vector that would resist the body’s pre-existing antibodies to AAV during the directed evolution process. “When we tested it in primates, it looked safe and didn’t elicit an immune response. And now, in humans, we’ve seen the same thing,” he said, adding that there has been no evidence of an induced immune response.\n\n“Ultimately, I think gene editing will be what will cure CF,” Taylor-Cousar said because it would allow for the possibility of permanently correcting cells’ DNA, whereas other therapies are not permanent. “But that’s a long way away.” \n\n_Ashley P.

And that's why in [the] real world, we see visual acuity outcomes that are worse than what we see in clinical trials. So there is really an unmet need for having durable agents and sustained delivery of anti-VEGF. Gene therapy is one modality to address this treatment burden and hopefully stabilize visual acuity and improve long-term outcomes in the real world.”_**\n\nThe current standard of care for patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) consists of regular treatment with Aflibercept, an antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injection. While Aflibercept can stabilize the disease and prevent further degeneration of vision, it has a high treatment burden because it typically requires patients to receive injections every 4 to 8 weeks to maintain optimal efficacy. As a result of this, in real-world settings, patients often experience some level of vision degeneration because of not keeping up with these injections regularly.\n\n4D Molecular Therapeutics’ 4D-150, an investigational dual-mechanism gene therapy, is intended to address this unmet need by encoding transgenes for Aflibercept and an interference mRNA meant to block VEGF-C. The company expects that a 1-time treatment with a single injection of 4D-150 has the potential to allow for sustained production of these gene products in patients’ retinas.\n\nArshad Khanani, MD, the director of clinical research and director of Fellowship at Sierra Eye Associates, gave an oral presentation entitled, “Interim results for the phase 1/2 PRISM trial evaluating 4D-150, a dual-transgene intravitreal genetic medicine in individuals with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration,” at [the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) 2023 Annual Meeting](https://www.cgtlive.com/conferences/association-for-research-in-vision-and-ophthalmology-arvo-), held April 23-27, 2023, in New Orleans, Louisiana. The presentation covered the current data on the therapy to date that suggest that a dose response in favor of the high dose (3x1010 vg/eye), including reduction in supplemental anti-VEGF injections and in mean central subfield thickness (CST). All told, following 4D-150 administration, clinically-meaningful improvement of –92 µm in CST was shown at 36 weeks, as was stable best corrected visual acuity. The phase 2 dose-expansion stage of the PRISM trial (n = 50) is currently more than 50% enrolled, with enrollment expected to complete later this year.\n\nIn an interview with _CGTLive_ ™, Khanani gave background information about the current standard of care for wet AMD and explained how 4D-150 has the potential reduce treatment burden for patients with this disease. He also gave an overview of the promising safety and efficacy data presented at ARVO. Of note, he pointed out that in the highest dose cohort in the PRISM trial, 4 of 5 patients remained free of anti-VEGF injections at 24 weeks after treatment with 4D-150.\n\n[**_Click here for more coverage of ARVO 2023._**](https://www.cgtlive.com/conferences/association-for-research-in-vision-and-ophthalmology-arvo-)\n\n###### REFERENCES\n\n###### 1. 4DMT Presents Positive Interim Data from Intravitreal 4D-150 Phase 1/2 PRISM Clinical Trial in Patients with Wet AMD at ARVO 2023.

For listeners not familiar with David, who is he? \n\n**00:35** Neil LittmanI am incredibly excited to welcome David to the show today. David is co founder and CEO of 4D Molecular Therapeutics, a clinical stage, publicly traded biotech company that harnesses what they call the power of directed evolution for the development of targeted gene therapies. David is a physician scientist. He's a biotech entrepreneur with over 25 years of experience in the industry at both large and small companies, including Novartis, J and J Celgene Ignite Immunotherapies, which was a company that was acquired by Pfizer and others. David has really focused his career on a very specific niche around viral vector based therapeutics. This is gene therapy and oncolytic viral cancer immunotherapies. He is also a UC Berkeley professor. He's actively teaching and mentoring students in biotech entrepreneurship, which is actually how I first met David many years ago, recently. David is also the co founder and on the board of Directors of Life Sciences Entrepreneurship Center at UC Berkeley. \n\n**01:44** Neil LittmanI'm incredibly excited to talk to David, certainly about 4d Molecular Therapeutics, or Ford DMT for short, but also really about what he's seeing in the biotech ecosystem overall, the types of conversations he's having with the next generation and young biotech founders and entrepreneurs these days and what advice you would give to folks these days. \n\n**02:06** Danny LevineWhat's the problem Four DMT is trying to solve? \n\n**02:10** Neil LittmanYes. 4D is really built around using adeno associated vectors or AAV vectors. There's a number of limitations with the use of existing AAV vectors today. I want to drill down with David into what some of those challenges and limitations are and then how Four DMT is overcoming those challenges by using this idea of directed evolution, which is technology that was licensed by Fordmt from David Schaefer's lab at UC Berkeley. How is this idea of directed evolution overcoming some of those challenges that we see today with the use of AAV vectors? David will have a great perspective on all of that. \n\n**02:52** Danny LevineThis is not the first biotech to use directed evolution, but as far as I know, this is a fairly novel application of it. \n\n**03:00** Neil LittmanI think it is a novel application specifically focused around AAV. Interestingly, four DMT is pursuing both rare and large market diseases. As I mentioned before, they're a clinical stage company, so they have clinical safety and efficacy data. They have some results that just came out in February from Fabric Disease cardiomyopathy. I want to talk to David about those results. They have clinical POC at this point based on this underlying platform technology that they have. The other thing, as frequent listeners of this show know, that I like to talk about is this idea of platform versus asset centric models in the biotech space. David has really done a great job threading that needle. I'm really curious to get his perspective on the business model there and the pros and cons versus platform versus the asset centric development model. Well, if you're all set, I'm all set. \n\n**03:58** Neil LittmanLet's do it. Danny, david, I am incredibly excited to welcome you to the show today.\n\n**04:05** David KirnThanks for having me. \n\n**04:06** Neil LittmanToday we are going to talk about Gene, therapies 4D molecular therapeutics and your platform for developing disease specific vectors to target genetic diseases. Before we dive into the details though, given your involvement at UC Berkeley teaching and mentoring biotech entrepreneurs, I'd like to start with your high level thoughts around the biotech ecosystem. David, it seems like there are more and more biotech entrepreneurs than ever before. What's your perspective on the biotech startup ecosystem these days? \n\n**04:39** David KirnWell, I think you're right. I think it's really exploding. I certainly see this on campus at UC Berkeley. There's probably 15 different organizations on campus that have tie ins to biotech innovation and entrepreneurship. I think it's an incredibly exciting time. That having been said, this is a very difficult business. It's complex, and I think when innovators and entrepreneurs early in their career decide to go down this road, I think it's really important to get as much education and knowledge as you can and as much mentorship as you can, because this is not for the faint of heart. This is an exciting but very difficult business model that we have in biotech. It requires hundreds of millions of dollars of investment and fundraising and ten plus years to get products approved. It's incredibly exciting and has a huge impact on the world. It's challenging and I think mentorship and networking and podcasts like this are essential part of the background that these entrepreneur innovators need to succeed. \n\n**05:56** Neil LittmanDavid, we're seeing, I think, more and more younger founders these days emerge who aren't necessarily interested in pursuing a career in academia and they're looking at other options. You obviously do a lot of mentoring and have done a lot of mentoring over the years. What advice do you give to particularly young founders who are looking to start out on their own? \n\n**06:21** David KirnWell, I think first and foremost, what I try to convey to people is this is not Facebook or Apple, where a couple of college dropouts can start something in their garage with some money from friends and family. The amount of money capital that has to be raised to develop drugs, the time it takes, the need for regulatory oversight, the intellectual property and patent issues. This is a much more complex kind of organization to start up versus what people classically think of in high tech. I really try to share that with people and convey that to them that like, hey, don't think you can just rush into this and you're going to be the next unicorn in a few years. That's not how this industry works. I do encourage early stage innovators and entrepreneurs to try to get some experience at larger organizations first. Now, that could be at a consulting firm where you see lots of different companies. \n\n**07:34** David KirnIt could be at an investment bank where you get exposed to a lot of different companies and business models. It can be in organizations that support business development. I do challenge folks to get some experience first and not think that you can go straight from undergrad or even grad school into this at the highest levels, especially as a CEO entrepreneur. I just think that is a difficult proposition. So I try to maintain their excitement. It's an incredibly exciting field, and you can make a huge impact. I think being humble and getting experience and exposure to the ecosystem for several years before going off on your own is important. \n\n**08:23** Neil LittmanDavid, you're clearly talking from experience yourself. Let's talk about your experience, particularly with 4D Molecular Therapeutics, or I'll say four DMT for short. The company was built around technology licensed from David Schaefer's lab at UC Berkeley. Can you talk about the early days of getting four DMT off the ground? \n\n**08:43** David KirnYeah, absolutely. I would say first and foremost, I had 20 years in the industry before coming to that point to start 40 Mt. I got into the industry from UCSF. I was on the faculty there and made the jump into biotech in the early to mid 90s when it was still very new, very high risk. A lot of people thought I was crazy for doing it, but I just learned a tremendous amount at Onyx, which eventually got multiple drugs approved and was acquired by Amgen for $10 billion eventually. The investors in that company, blue chip investors, great management team, great scientists, I just learned a tremendous amount there. I had another couple of startups before I started 4D, so I came to 4D with significant experience. My career had really been focused on innovation in the viral vector therapeutics area, so both viral vector based gene therapy approaches as well as cancer oncolytics and Immunotherapy. \n\n**09:56** David KirnI had sold my last company, where I was founder and CEO for about ten years, that was called Generics. It was a private company that I sold when the lead asset got to phase three, and I was really looking for the next big thing in viral vector based therapeutics, I was networking. I went to QB three and spoke with Reg Kelly and Doug Crawford there, and they said, hey, if that's what you're looking for, there's this guy at Berkeley who's doing some really innovative stuff with directed evolution to come up with novel improved vectors for gene therapy. For me, it's one of these things where I was looking for something like that, and this technology was really ideal for what I was looking for in my next company to build and hit it off with Dave Schaefer. And we've been going strong ever since. We're ten years out now, so there's. \n\n**10:52** Neil LittmanA lot to dive into around the business model that I want to come back to because I want to drill down into the technology first. You've really built four DMT around using AAV vectors. Before we get into what you're specifically doing, let's talk about the limits with the use of existing AAV vectors that are being used today. What are some of the challenges in delivering these therapies? \n\n**11:21** David KirnYeah, so that's a perfect introductory question to the area. I think anytime as an entrepreneur innovator, you start a new company, you're building off something that's there already, but there's an unmet need. I think you have to really start with what's that unmet need. So, with AV, the good news is it's a stable particle. It is able to deliver transgenes to target cells with relatively little immune response compared to, say, adenovirus. There's certainly a huge amount of clinical data showing relative safety with AV to date. So that's a good news. There are examples of approved products for SMA One and for LCA Two in the eye with first generation conventional vectors and even now hemophilia. The bad news is and the limitations with AV are as follows. These are capsids, essentially protein coats, almost like a soccer ball with DNA inside it. These have not been targeted to any tissue in the body. \n\n**12:33** David KirnNot surprisingly, if these didn't evolve to target specific tissues that we want to treat, in the vast majority of cases, AAV is going to be very inefficient at transducing cell types that we want to transduce as entrepreneur innovators and as physicians. Delivery is very inefficient as well. Whether it's by IV delivery to skeletal muscle and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or intravitral injection to try to target the retina, AV delivery is extremely inefficient to the vast majority of tissues in the body. The third big limit is that since these are in the population, these capsids, many people have preexisting immunity to these capsids and therefore can bind them with antibodies and prevent efficacy, and generally those patients are excluded. Finally, because of the inefficient delivery, inefficient transduction, very high doses are typically used many thousands or tens of thousands of particles per cell, and that can lead to inflammation and toxicities. \n\n**14:02** David KirnWe started the company, these were the four hurdles were staring at saying, okay, these are the hurdles we need to overcome to unlock the full potential of gene therapy. \n\n**14:16** Neil LittmanDavid, you had mentioned some of the work that David Schaefer is doing at Berkeley, and specifically you mentioned this idea of directed evolution. My understanding is that this directed evolution really underpins the 40 mt platform. Can you talk about and explain this concept of directed evolution? \n\n**14:36** David KirnAbsolutely. Well, first of all, I'd start by saying it's a Nobel Prize winning technology that was developed by other scientists. It was awarded about four years ago, but it's been applied to enzymes, industrial enzymes for chemical engineering, it's been applied to antibodies and other phase display, et cetera. It's an incredibly powerful technology that allows us to essentially use the principles of evolution to rapidly generate novel biologics that have the features that we want. The way we apply it to the AV capsid, which is again, just a protein coat, is we start by generating massive diversity. So evolution, the first step is diversity. In this case, we've generated on the order of 1 billion different AV capsids. Instead of taking one or two that are present in nature that everyone else uses, we started by creating a billion versions of this. We did it through a variety of molecular biology techniques to induce that diversity. \n\n**15:57** David KirnNow we have this library, almost like a small molecule chemical library, but in this case it's a capsid library. The protein coat, that's the delivery vehicle for gene therapy. Each one of those capsids then is manufactured and it's barcoded with its own DNA. Getting that one to one linkage is an incredible feat and trade secret that our scientists have been optimizing for the last ten years, building on what Dave Schaefer did in his lab. So that's the starting material. Now, the second step, we actually go to the whiteboard and we ask the question for the treatment of any disease with AV gene therapy, what characteristics, what features do we want that capsid of AV to have? So, in other words, how do we want to infuse this into the body? Do we want to go intravenously IV? Do we want to do aerosol delivery to Long? \n\n**16:56** David KirnDo we want to do intravitreal injection to target the retina? We start with what's the tissue and cell type I want to target and treat. What's the route of administration I want to use and then what's the dose range that I want to be in, to have a reasonable cost of goods and no manufacturing constraints, and also to be in a dose level that's been shown to be safe in prior studies. In some cases, we also ask the question, do we want to build in resistance to antibodies in the human population if we think that's going to be an issue? We put all these together on a whiteboard and we call that the target vector profile for our product. The third step, then we take that profile, we take the physical capsid library, and now we administer the library into primates. Again, we have to use non human primates to be as close to the human situation as possible, because evolution is critical to be in the right species. \n\n**18:05** David KirnSo we can't do this in mice. We go into non human primates and we administer the library by the route of administration that we want to use in the clinic for the product. We wait a couple of weeks and then we harvest the cells or the tissues that we wanted to treat. We harvest those, we bring them back to the lab and we break them open and we look to see what capsids made it there by looking at their DNA barcode. What you would have is say 0.1% of the vectors in our original library would have made it to our target cell of interest. We then grow those vectors up because it's still many hundreds, if not thousands of vectors that made it there. We grow those up and we do another round in another animal, this time more stringently, so at a lower dose or after exposing to human antibodies, and we use that to increase the stringency. \n\n**19:01** David KirnAfter that round, when we look at what reached the cells, it's even smaller population of capsids that made it. What we're essentially doing is competitive selection where these vectors are competing with each other to see which one fits that target vector profile the best. After two to four rounds of this, we've funneled down from a billion variants down to one or two, which are dominant, which are clearly the best for matching that target vector profile. \n\n**19:30** Neil LittmanDavid, I love that idea of the target vector profile. It sounds like you may have been borrowing from the idea of a target product profile, which is very common in drug development. I think that's a really interesting way that you view things. Let's talk about then the different indications that you are pursuing. You're pursuing both rare and large market diseases. You have a pipeline that extends across ophthalmology, pulmonology and cardiology. I think about your technology, it really appears to be broadly applicable. How do you think about the potential indications to pursue and then how do you prioritize them? \n\n**20:10** David KirnYeah, well, I think that's the ultimate challenge with a platform and product company. As you rightly point out, this platform of directed evolution of these AV capsids is incredibly broadly applicable. We can essentially develop a vector for any tissue we want to target in the body. For us the challenge was to say, look, we have to focus. We don't have unlimited resources, people, finances, et cetera. At the same time, this is high risk, developing novel therapeutics and novel caps. Since we can't predict what unforeseen problems may arise in the clinic, it's very difficult to predict which product candidates going to win. So we also have to diversify. We just, after a lot of debate and discussion, felt like three shots on goal with three different vectors by three different routes of administration was the way to go. We invented vectors for intravitual delivery to the retina. \n\n**21:21** David KirnThere's a huge unmet need there. There's 200 rare diseases and multiple large market diseases in the eye that we could target. We really felt that was an important area to be in. The retina is very stable, doesn't turn over, so we're going to get long term expression there. We were also interested in lung disease by aerosol delivery that had failed with traditional Avs. Historically there was a huge unmet need there and then IV to muscle and we started with the Heart because there was a partner, Pfizer, who was very interested in that as a target. We like that diversification of building products from three different vectors, three different routes of administration to really try to derisk the company overall. We've now taken five products into the clinic with these three different vectors. Sure enough, we're finding that some products are working incredibly well right out of the chute. \n\n**22:23** David KirnOthers have had unforeseen challenges that have slowed development and we're overcoming those, but it's slowed development. I think that diversification has served us well. \n\n**22:40** Neil LittmanDavid, I want to talk about some of the results that you've seen in the clinic, but I do want to just pick up on a really important thread that you mentioned there, which I think is an ongoing debate within the biotech industry. This idea of developing a platform technology and a platform based company versus the asset centric development model of developing one or maybe two therapeutics and driving hard towards clinical data. Can you talk about it, but love to expand upon your thoughts around this notion of building a platform versus pushing a particular therapeutic fast to get to clinical proof of concept. How do you balance those two? \n\n**23:22** David KirnYeah, I think these are all valid business models and I think it's just up to the entrepreneur innovator and the investors to all be aligned on what you're trying to build. I think one extreme is you're a platform company. You never develop your own products. You just are almost a CRO for other companies to enable their products. That's certainly not an unreasonable business model. That's never been very interesting to me because I'm a drug developer and I like to develop products and I think the upside of that model is pretty limited. On the other extreme is you see some companies where maybe they've outlicensed a product from Big Pharma or from a university and that company exists, just developed that one product or maybe two related products, but basically in that model, they're really experts in drug development in a specific therapeutic area and that's a reasonable business model. \n\n**24:22** David KirnIt's high risk because you're kind of putting all your eggs in that one basket and if it fails, there's not much left. If investors and the entrepreneurs who start that company are all aligned and that's a perfectly fine business model. I personally have always gravitated towards the combination of platform and product because I like the fact that you're developing a platform that could result in many different products for different therapeutic areas while also having the value generator of products that are being developed that you own the rights to, that most investors are going to want to see, especially if you're a publicly traded company, they're going to want to see that you own the rights to some important products. I like that balance of a platform and product company, but they're all certainly reasonable business models. \n\n**25:17** Neil LittmanDavid you mentioned another really important point that I want to pick up on is that idea of owning the rights to your products. You've been very successful with partnerships over the years. Could you talk about, first that notion of balancing the partnerships versus giving too much away and then maybe just highlight a couple of the partnerships and some of the strategy behind those partnerships? \n\n**25:38** David KirnYeah, I think why do we consider partnerships? Well, it's a way to get resources, certainly cash research support, financial research support. Sometimes it's expertise. The partner will have expertise in a certain therapeutic platform or a certain therapeutic area that's beneficial. Certainly they may have the ability to do large phase three studies and or commercialization in a way that a small company can't. Finally there's the validation as you're building a company. One really good way to validate your company and your technology in the eyes of investors is to have partnerships with important companies. When we started out, we had a Roche partnership, we had a Pfizer partnership, and this really, I think, was validating in the eyes of investors and helped us get significant investments as well as having the benefit of the partnership. Now, that having been said, if you want to build a big public company, you have to retain enough rights that you're still attractive for investors and attractive to a potential pharmaceutical acquirer down the road. \n\n**26:59** David KirnBecause that's what drives your price in the public markets is really that idea that eventually you may get acquired by a large pharma and if you've given away too many rights already, then that's never going to happen. If you never partner, well, then you got to raise a lot of money and it's higher risk. I think I've always tried to get a nice blend of some de risking partnerships early on, but retain the rights as long as we can to the biggest value driver products. In our case, at 40 Mt, that's our large market. Wet AMD and Diabetic Macular edema product 41 50. We've retained the rights to that because we felt like that's a multibillion dollar market and that's something that investors and a potential acquirer down the road would be very important that we'd retain those rights. \n\n**28:02** Neil LittmanYeah. David and just one more point on that, and it's probably a hazard from spending a lot of my career in business development, but as you think about retaining rights, there's all kinds of different ways to slice and dice that. Maybe you could talk about a specific experience that you have at Fordmt or maybe just general advice for biotech entrepreneurs out there is you can retain rights for specific products or for specific indications for a specific product or specific geographies. Are there maybe red flags that you would watch out for or is it very product specific? \n\n**28:35** David KirnWell, I think it's product and platform specific. What we tried to do with our platform is make sure weren't giving away too much. If were going to give worldwide rights to a partner, we wanted to make sure it was just for our vector with their transient payload. We didn't want to give away the disease target writ large because there might be new disease targets that come up later that we couldn't pursue if we did that. Likewise, we didn't want to sell or partner off the entire vector because we wanted to leverage what were doing with a partner and use that vector for other diseases involving the same tissue. We really tried to refine what their rights were to keep it as narrow as possible. Then, as you said, the other is geographical. The thing that we want to protect as much as possible for our large market opportunities like 41 50 and Wet AMD is that US market, that's at least 50% or more of the worldwide market. \n\n**29:40** David KirnIf we can retain that but maybe monetize the rights from other regions in the world, that's another way to kind of thread the needle and retain enough value but still get do a big deal and get the resources from a large BD deal. Anyway, I think that's how I've thought about it over the years and sounds like you've had similar experiences. \n\n**30:06** Neil LittmanI have, yeah, a number of ways to slice and dice these deals. David, I want to circle back to some of the clinical data that you've seen so far. In February you announced updated interim safety and efficacy data from, I believe it was two phase one two trials in fabric disease cardiomyopathy. Can you talk about those results? \n\n**30:31** David KirnYeah. We've released recently data on three different programs for 43 ten is our product in fabric disease cardiomyopathy. This is a disease where the leading cause of death is heart failure. The problem for these patients is they have a mutation in an enzyme that basically acts to clear toxins out of the cell. Since they don't have that enzyme, the toxins can build up in the heart and elsewhere and cause significant problems. The standard of care is to give very high doses of the enzyme into the blood every two weeks and that just really has minimal benefit and essentially no benefit on the heart. We designed 310 with a vector that we evolved to target the heart with relatively low doses that would be safe and effective IV. Were excited to report out recently that the first three patients that we'd treated with this disease who'd made it out to a year had shown very significant improvements in their heart function and quality of life. \n\n**31:48** David KirnEven by imaging showing that we cleared out some of that toxin substrate out of those cells by expressing the enzyme there, we also reported biopsy results showing a high level expression from our vector throughout the heart tissue and expressing that enzyme to really cure the cardiomyopathy. So, early days, but very exciting proof of concept for that program. \n\n**32:16** Neil LittmanYeah, no, that's very exciting. How do you think in general about the regulatory pathway for some of your clinical candidates? This a traditional phase one through phase three pathway? Are there specific designations that you can take advantage of, such as RMAT or others for accelerated approval? How do you think in general about a regulatory strategy for these types of products? \n\n**32:42** David KirnYeah, I think the regulatory path is driven more by the disease indication and the current standard of care, more so than the particular therapeutic modality. I think FDA says, look, I don't care if it's an enzyme or antibody or a small molecule. Clinically, here's what matters to patients and here's the unmet need. We go into certain populations, such as, say, choroid armia in the eye, where this is uniformly blinding, there's no available therapy for those patients. We think about, hey, is there an accelerated approval pathway where we could choose a surrogate endpoint that's reasonably likely to predict for clinical benefit long term and get to the market very quickly, even potentially with a single arm study? Conversely, for something like wet AMD, which affects millions of people in the US. Elsewhere, and where there are pretty good standard therapies today, that's one where we're going to need two large randomized phase three studies to get onto the market. \n\n**33:57** David KirnI think it's really driven by the patient population and the unmet need and the severity of the disease outcome more so than our particular technology makes sense. \n\n**34:09** Neil LittmanDavid, why don't we actually that's a great segue to talk about patients. You've developed partnerships with a number of patient advocacy groups. How do you work with these groups and how do you look to them to potentially inform clinical decision making, if at all? \n\n**34:27** David KirnWell, I would say if you want to treat rare diseases, which, again, are quite attractive as targets, working with a patient advocacy organization is an incredibly powerful way to do it. First of all, they know the disease and the impact on their day to day life better than anyone. Thinking about endpoints that you could point to that would be predictors of benefit, clinical benefit, they know better than anybody, and so they can really guide your clinical development. They have access to patients through newsletters and their website, and so you. Can get the word out about your clinical trials and help with recruitment. Many of these are quite well funded. The best example of this is the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation where we've been working together for over five years now and they put over $15 million into the company, some of it investment in the company and some of it earmarked for CF drug development. \n\n**35:38** David KirnThey're sitting on an endowment of multiple billions of dollars. They can be a funding source as well if they agree with your technology and your therapeutic approach. These patient advocacy organizations can help in a huge number of ways.\n\n**35:58** Neil LittmanDavid, I've seen that firsthand when I was at the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. We had patient advocacy representatives in almost everything we did. We had many patient advocates actually sitting on the CERN board. We had patient advocates as part of our clinical review process. And I think you are spot on. They have such deep expertise in their disease area that they bring a tremendous amount of value. Circling back to the earlier conversation we're having around what you call the TVP or the TPP for a lot of pharma products, they have such a good they provide such tremendous experience in terms of how the product can be used and what they would want to use to treat their own disease. I think it's really invaluable and I scratch my head. I don't know why more companies don't engage with patient advocacy groups, but anyway, I'm a big advocate of that. \n\n**36:54** Neil LittmanDavid, let's switch gears and talk about the macro environment and how that may or may not impact your plans going forward. Clearly, the macro funding environment overall has been challenging. In biotech in particular, it's extremely challenging with a lot of companies trading at or below cash value. How do you think the macro environment has changed your plans for moving therapies through the clinic, if at all? \n\n**37:27** David KirnWell, I'd say that first of all, for entrepreneur innovators listening to this podcast, it's really important to remember there's a lot of things that are very challenging that you can control, that you need to be on top of, and then there's a ton of stuff you cannot control. You point out, rightly, that the macro environment can really impact your planning, your ability to raise capital, and those are things that can be pretty unpredictable. When went public at the end of 2000, were able to take advantage of the fact that tons of money flooded into biotech during the pandemic for a variety of reasons. We did an IPO that was oversubscribed probably 15 times and we raised $225,000,000 approximately. Fast forward a year later and even though we had hit every single milestone we said were going to hit, we raised 125,000,000 at about the same price as we'd been able to raise at the IPO. \n\n**38:41** David KirnSoon thereafter all of the stock prices, our sector went down dramatically due to macroeconomic forces. Also some read through from what other gene therapy companies had struggled with. That kind of paints a brush across all gene therapy companies, no matter how much you say you're different. I guess I would just say that you have to be ready for these swings. I think it's for me, the way I've addressed this is to try never to get too far out ahead of our skis. Even in good times, if we can raise the money, we raise it, but we don't up our spend. We try to keep it conservative, we try to keep a long runway because we just know that things can change. We try to have a diverse business model which could be more resistant to changes in the market with business development deals, for example. \n\n**39:42** David KirnI think you just have to have that constructive paranoia where you're ready for these things. We're fortunate that we raised money again. We did our IPO at the end of 2000, we raised money again in the fall of 21 even though the price wasn't very attractive. We got some pushback from certain investors and we said, look, we think it's smart to take money because we don't know what the future holds. Now fast forward, we're in a great position. We have cash out into 2025 so we can weather this downturn. A lot of other biotech companies that overspent and got ahead of their skis are going bankrupt and running out of money. Anyway, that's kind of how I think about it and I think we'll weather this storm. Biotech is cyclical, it'll come back and it'll be hot again at some point in the future. You got to be ready for these downturns. \n\n**40:36** Neil LittmanYeah, no question. Actually, just out of curiosity since we're on the topic of your IPO, so as you mentioned that you completed your IPO at the end of 2020. If I recall, you initially planned to do an IPO in 2019 but instead decided to do another private round. I'm just curious, what was the thinking behind doing another private round versus going public in 2019? \n\n**41:01** David KirnThe market just wasn't there. We weren't in the clinic yet and we thought there was significant interest in the company. When went to looking to do an IPO and we really asked the question can we do a high quality IPO that's going to raise enough money to get us out far enough to hit a number of value inflections, we just felt it wasn't there. As painful as it is, we felt it was better to pull that than to try to force an IPO and then have to be back raising money again in six months without incremental data. Fortunately, our investors that came in on our series A and B stayed with us and supported us and bought us enough time to then do a very successful IPO. I guess that's another learning that I have is it's very important to get the right investors into your company early on so you can weather those downturns and you can have a delay in a program and still survive, whereas if you have the wrong investors around the table, that's not possible sometimes. \n\n**42:23** David KirnYeah. \n\n**42:23** Neil LittmanActually, David, let's talk about that for a minute. I mean, as you said, finding the right investors and the right mix of investors is incredibly important. As you rewind back to the early days. Who were some of those investors? Were they all venture capitalists? Did you have some angel investors? It sounds like maybe you had some nondilutive funding as well. Could you talk about that mix that helped you create this successful entity that you have today, whether the storms get public, all of those things? \n\n**42:54** David KirnYeah, I guess the topic that raises is who do you take money from and what are the pros and cons? Right? Because everybody's, it's an ecosystem, everyone's got a job to do, and there's trade offs for everything. In the case of 40 mt, I wanted to avoid early stage VCs if at all possible. It's not that those people aren't incredibly bright, they are, they're incredibly good at what they do. I felt that their model would be very much like, hey, let's try this product, and then if it works, we can always build a big company later. I felt that was way too risky. I'd seen that with other platform companies where investors come in, they've got a shorter term horizon, there's a downturn in the market, and all of a sudden they're killing all your programs except for your lead, and then you bet the farm on the lead. \n\n**43:51** David KirnAnd I really wanted to avoid that. Instead of going to early stage VCs, I went to foundations, patient advocacy groups and foundations, and also I went to pharmaceutical partnerships for the very reason that we wouldn't lose control and we could continue to diversify our product portfolio. So that's what we did. Were able to avoid early stage VCs. We did a large investment round with Pfizer leading it. Our series b was an institutional round, and at that point were able to bring in more crossover investors. These are the investors, as who invest in the last round or two of a private company and then invest in the IPO and bridge you into that public market. They're much less controlling, they are much less likely to change your plans. They're, they take less control at the board level. We got a great group of crossover investors, viking BVF, Janice Arrowmark, Kasden, who then stayed with us for three or four different rounds. \n\n**45:27** Neil LittmanDavid, I think that's so fascinating. I think that's a great lesson for all the biotech entrepreneurs out there. There's lots of ways to finance and build a company. You don't necessarily have to go to early stage VCs that might be a fit for some companies, but there are certainly other alternatives. So thank you for sharing that. David, I want to be cognizant of your time. I'm sure we can spend another couple of days talking about some of the details in your technology, but I want to wrap up with one final question I like to ask, and that's always around culture. I often don't feel like we talk about culture enough in our industry. It's obviously critically important to building a successful company. How did you think about the culture when you were building for DMT? Did you have a culture in mind that you wanted to shape and build, or do you really think it was a result of the hiring decisions that you made and a culture emerged from. \n\n**46:20** David KirnThe people that you hired, very much the former. So it was very intentional. I'd been fortunate that I'd had three other companies that I'd founded and I consulted for more than ten different companies, so I'd seen a lot of different cultures and I came into 4D. In any company, I am a co founder on now, where I was very intentional about setting a culture and then hiring people that fit that culture and retaining the people and rewarding the people who fit that culture and moving out the people who don't. Because a culture can be polluted so quickly by just a person or two. You have to take it very seriously. I think the worst thing you can do is put the cultural statement on your boardroom wall and just ignore it, because then I think a lot of employees look at that as very hypocritical and look at it with a cynical view if you're not taking it seriously. \n\n**47:27** David KirnAt 4D we set out with an explicit culture. We hire for it when we evaluate people throughout the year, we evaluate not just on whether you hit your goals, but how are you performing according to the corporate culture and guiding principles. We find that really reinforces the principles. Every time we're at an all hands meeting, when we call out somebody for doing well, we link it to a guiding principle. Our guiding principles are as follows one was Dare to Cure. We really wanted to have a mindset where were not looking for incremental improvements, but really transformative therapies. I think that takes a certain amount of guts to think big like that and take those risks. So one was dare to cure. The second was breaking boundaries. We wanted people who thought differently and just didn't do things because that's how they've always been done. We felt that was essential. \n\n**48:30** David KirnRelentless preparation and execution is our third guiding principle. That's just all about you can't prepare too much for an important presentation or an important negotiation or an important meeting with the FDA. And so we're really relentless about that. Our fourth guiding principle is beyond yourself and just keeping in mind that everything we do, it's for patients families, it's for our employees and teammates families to make sure they are supported and taken care of. It just ripples through everything we do. I think that's a fourth and very important guiding principle for us is beyond yourself. \n\n**49:23** Neil LittmanI love those principles. I think they're all extraordinarily powerful. So, David, I think we better leave it there. I would like to say a big thank you for joining me on the show today. \n\n**49:34** David KirnAll right. Thanks so much, Neil, for having me. It's been great. Really appreciate it. \n\n**49:41** Danny LevineWell, Neil, what did you think? \n\n**49:42** Neil LittmanI thought that was a really great and wide ranging conversation with David. We talked a lot about their platform for directed evolution, how that's different than what is being done today, why it's different, how it's more specific to certain cell tissue type things like that, which is, I think, incredibly exciting. I was just really fascinated with the story of how David built 4D from the earliest stage, the earliest days and earliest stages around, forming the company, licensing the technology, building the culture, ultimately taking the company public. And it's a long journey. They still have a long ways to go to get approved drugs. It's just that entrepreneurial journey I find endlessly fascinating. You heard David took, I guess what you would call maybe a slightly nontraditional path in terms of early financing for the company, going out to disease organizations for financing, striking partnerships for nondilutive capital coming in, as opposed to going to early stage VCs. \n\n**50:53** Neil LittmanWe know drug development is very expensive. It was really interesting to see that he took a different path, and they've been very successful. There are a whole variety of different paths that are maybe slightly nontraditional that companies can take to build an integrated therapeutics company like what for DMT has done. \n\n**51:12** Danny LevineThere's a lot of interest in the industry today to develop vectors that can target specific cells and have other properties. You talked with David about their use of directed evolution. How effective an approach do you think that is to getting to ideal vectors? \n\n**51:32** Neil LittmanWell, it sounds like it is an ideal approach. You heard David talk about going from a billion vector capsid sequences throughout the process to selecting the one or two appropriate vectors for a given therapeutic purpose. That's obviously an iterative process that they've refined over many years. At the end of the day, the proof is going to be in clinical results. They have relatively early proof of concept in the clinic showing that their approach is working. Still early days, they still have a long way to go to get approved therapies, but obviously it is working. They have positive clinical data both around safety, around efficacy. Clearly what they're doing is working and it is different and it is really unique. It was really fascinating to hear David's perspective on how he went about building this platform and having multiple shots on goal with several different assets with different delivery approaches and different indications and how that served to derisk the company overall. \n\n**52:44** Neil LittmanI think that was just a really fascinating conversation. \n\n**52:47** Danny LevineWell, that is a challenge that companies with these broadly applicable platform technologies face. How do you think about the balance that four DMT is striking between being a platform company and being a product company, and particularly in the current financial environment where developing a pipeline can be limiting? \n\n**53:09** Neil LittmanYeah, there's no question it's a challenging environment out there and entrepreneurs need to probably not have as many programs that they can finance in parallel. There's just not as much capital as there was two years ago, so you need to prioritize a little more. But I really like David's approach. Right. There is no one right answer. You can build a platform company and that is a business model and you can license out different technologies that come out of that to other companies that are then going to develop the resulting therapeutic. And that's fine. We've seen a lot of successful companies do that. Or as David said, on the far end of the spectrum, you could have a single asset to have tremendous expertise around that asset, that indication and drive really hard to make that work. We've seen lots of successful companies acquired for billions of dollars based on that model as well. \n\n**54:00** Neil LittmanDavid decided that for DMT, he were to thread the needle, have a basket of assets, have the platform, but then really pursue the development of these assets in different indications, with different delivery mechanisms and have that as the way to derisk. And so I really like that. Right, so it's the platform, but there are lead assets to prove the validity of the platform. So I like that approach. I really agree with that approach. I think that's really exciting. There is no one size fits all in the industry. \n\n**54:34** Danny LevineYou asked David about the funding environment today for DMT, raised the sizable amount of money through an IPO and then more in a subsequent offering. He talked about avoiding early stage VCs in his private rounds. Any lessons here for biotechs in raising and spending cash? \n\n**54:53** Neil LittmanAbsolutely. I think the big takeaway is that there are a number of ways to finance an early stage biotech company. One does not necessarily have to go the traditional route of raising large rounds from traditional early stage biotech VCs to build a successful biotech company. You heard David go through his example and specific experience. And so I think that's really powerful. I can just echo my experience from Serum, where Cerm would provide, and I think still does provide up to $20 million of nondilutive funding for companies to really move into and move through early stage clinical development. I think Term now was funding up the phase three clinical development, but there are pockets of money out there beyond the traditional Biotech VCs that you can tap into, whether it's non dilutive funding from patient advocacy groups and organizations or places like Serum, or it's non dilutive funding from strategic partners, which you heard David talk about. \n\n**55:57** Neil LittmanI think my big takeaway is you have to be a little creative here and again. There's no one right path. It's going to depend on a lot of the nuances around what you want your company to be, how much control you want to maintain, and what your vision is for the future. \n\n**56:14** Danny LevineWell, until next time. \n\n**56:16** Neil LittmanAll right.

So, our hope is that with 4150, we will be able to control wet AMD very well. It’s also exciting because it’s administered in clinic.”**\n\nNew data from cohort 1 of the phase 1/2 PRISM trial (NCT05197270) has shown that the gene therapy 4D-150 (4D Molecular Therapeutics) restored aflibercept expression to therapeutic levels in 5 patients in with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). These participants each received a single intravitreal injection of 3E10 vg/eye of 4D-150.\n\nInvestigators found that participants had a 96.7% reduction in mean annualized anti-VEGF injection rate, from around 11 in the year prior to enrollment.Most participants (80%) did not receive any supplemental aflibercept injections for around 40, 36, 32, or 16 weeks after treatment. Therapeutic levels of aflibercept expression were found in the aqueous humor of the eye at 12 weeks after injection.\n\n_CGTLive_ spoke with principal investigator Arshad Khanani, MD, director, clinical research, and clinical associate professor, University of Nevada Reno School of Medicine, to learn more about the potential of gene therapy in wet AMD. He discussed unmet needs within the patient population of wet AMD, including treatment burden and patient compliance.\n\n###### REFERENCE\n\n###### 4D Molecular Therapeutics announces interim clinical data from on-going phase 1/2 clinical trial of intravitreal 4D-150 for wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD).
