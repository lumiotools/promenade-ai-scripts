(the “Company”) (NASDAQ: AGRI; AGRIW), an intellectual property (IP) focused technology company, announces the evolution of its business model to follow the closing of its recently announced bitcoin mining facility acquisition.\n\nAgriFORCE CEO Jolie Kahn commented, “As we approach a key milestone in the progression of our growth strategy it is important to clarify how our adoption of an innovative combination of technologies will reduce the environmental impact of data centers while simultaneously producing revenue from high yield agricultural operations. Upon closing we intend to utilize our new data center to leverage energy generated from flare natural gas-powered operations to increase the environmental mitigation and revenue potential of our integrated cogeneration site. Located in Alberta, Canada, at the site of the intended acquisition, we will be testing an integrated and automated onsite carbon sequestering agricultural operation which will reuse the waste energy from the onsite natural gas generator. By adopting this integrated approach, we’re able to reduce our carbon emissions while also contributing to local food security and economic growth.\n\n“Cryptocurrency mining has long been criticized for its energy-intensive nature, with facilities relying heavily on fossil fuels to power the complex computing systems needed for transaction verification and blockchain maintenance. Our initiative seeks to take a more holistic approach to sustainability by capturing carbon in the biomass of micro-greens and waste heat in an aquaculture system thereby leveraging the byproducts of data center operations to support environmentally friendly agricultural systems. The anticipated benefit to the Company will be the creation of new diversified revenue streams supporting our topline mission to build long-term value for all our stakeholders,” concluded Kahn.\n\nWhile benefiting from Alberta’s strong incentive programs, i.e., the Alberta Carbon Capture Incentive Program, the Company hopes to reuse waste resources to produce profit from cryptocurrency mining, Alberta carbon credits for carbon sequestration and methane reduction, and the sale of premium crops. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Company’s process will capture natural gas flares to generate significant low-cost energy to operate the cryptocurrency mining rigs. The new facility, and any facilities that the Company may acquire moving forward, will capture and redirect heat from miners and the generator to warm an enclosure suitable for growing white-legged shrimp (Penaeus Vannamei), and controlled environment agriculture _._ The facility will then be utilized to produce a continuous supply of fresh shrimp, red seaweed and micro-greens for local markets and restaurants. Micro-greens are a fast-growing, nutrient-dense crop that requires relatively little space and water to produce commercial yields, while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n**ABOUT AGRIFORCE** AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd.

(the “Company”) (NASDAQ: AGRI), an intellectual property focused technology company, provides an update to shareholders highlighting the Company’s ongoing strategic shift toward advancement of its sustainable technology initiatives and its signing of a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) to purchase a Bitcoin mining facility in Alberta, Canada, powered by sustainable energy.\n\nAgriFORCE CEO Jolie Kahn stated, “Our strategic vision remains centered on the pursuit of sustainable technology opportunities that will support the company’s dedication to building long-term shareholder value. To this end, we announce the next phase of our transition, highlighted by the integration of Bitcoin mining solutions and the ancillary environmental and power-generation benefits that result from engaging in that business. We recognize the potential of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in facilitating sustainable financial transactions and intend to utilize 10-20% of our future capital raised to purchase and hold Bitcoin. We look forward to keeping our shareholders informed of our ongoing exploration of additional innovative platforms that align with our dynamic growth strategy.\n\n“Relying upon my experience as general counsel to a recognized Bitcoin mining company and of other team members in this industry, this is our first foray in the crypto space. We have entered into an LOI and paid an initial deposit to purchase a mining facility in Alberta, Canada, with the cost of power generated from captured flare gas estimated at four cents Canadian per kWh. The site has the capacity for 1.2 MW, which we believe will provide the opportunity to generate immediate cash flow for the Company In addition, we will be using our proprietary technology to set up CEA facilities to capture carbon exhaust to decarbonize and use for sustainable agriculture that we believe will provide further value via carbon offsets and credits and agricultural production.\n\n“We believe that the crypto industry, Bitcoin in particular, provides an opportunity to create valuable assets within the Company, additional financial capital wherewithal as Bitcoin are mined and applied to our balance sheet, and, as we are doing in this pilot, the opportunity to demonstrate the value of our in-house technology to derive additional value and mitigate the environmental effects of data centers. We expect this transaction to be complete in the coming weeks and look forward to providing additional updates to our progress on this aspect of our strategy, as well as future activities,” concluded Kahn.\n\n**ABOUT AGRIFORCE** AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd.

These forward-looking statements represent our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies concerning future events, including, but not limited to, any statements regarding our assumptions about financial performance; the continuation of historical trends; the sufficiency of our cash balances for future liquidity and capital resource needs; the expected impact of changes in accounting policies on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows; anticipated problems and our plans for future operations; and the economy in general or the future of the agriculture technology industry, all of which were subject to various risks and uncertainties.\n\nWhen used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10- Q and other reports, statements, and information we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission” or “SEC”), in our press releases, in our periodic reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, in oral statements made by or with the approval of an executive officer, the words or phrases “believes,” “may,” “will,” “expects,” “should,” “continue,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “will likely result,” “estimates,” “projects” or similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. However, any statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. We caution that these statements by their nature involve risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control, and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of important factors.\n\nWe do not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. You should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors described in this annual report. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. has identified important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete list of all potential risks or uncertainties.\n\n3  \n---  \n  \n**PART I — FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PREPARATION**\n\n**_Business Overview_**\n\nAgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. (“AgriFORCE™” or the “Company”) was incorporated as a private company by Articles of Incorporation issued pursuant to the provisions of the _Business Corporations Act (British Columbia)_ on December 22, 2017. The Company’s registered and records office address is at 800 – 525 West 8th Avenue, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V5Z 1C6.\n\nThe Company is an innovative sustainable technology focused company that strives to innovate and deliver sustainable technology solutions across a wide array of verticals utilization of our proprietary intellectual property to businesses and enterprises through our AgriFORCE™ Solutions division (“Solutions”) and deliver innovative flour products through our AgriFORCE™ Brands division (“Brands”). In the third quarter of 2024, the Company bought the assets of the Radical Clean Solutions (“RCS”) business for which it had bought an exclusive license to the agricultural industry in 2023. During 2023, the Company commenced efforts to launch its UN(THINK) Awakened Flour™, which is a nutritious flour that we believe provides health advantages over traditional flour.\n\nWhile Solutions’ legacy focus was to operate in the plant based pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and other high value crop markets using its unique proprietary facility design and hydroponics based automated growing system that enable cultivators to effectively grow crops in a controlled environment (“FORCEGH+™”). it has changed its focus to broaden the use of its proprietary intellectual property across multiple industries. For instance, the Company through its RCS purchase is not able to utilize that technology to deliver solutions across multiple industries, including not only agriculture, but other industries including hospitality, commercial applications, education institutions, residential real estate and transportation.\n\nBrands is focused on the development and commercialization of plant-based ingredients and products that deliver healthier and more nutritious solutions. We strive to market and commercialize both branded consumer product offerings and ingredient supply.\n\n**_Basis of Presentation_**\n\nThe accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and related financial information of AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the related notes thereto for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on April 1, 2024. These unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and SEC for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements.\n\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying interim financial statements contain all adjustments which are necessary to state fairly the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, or for any future period.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n**_Liquidity and Management’s Plan_**\n\nThe Company has incurred substantial operating losses since its inception and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. As reflected in the interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of $13.4 million, $3.4 million of net cash used in operating activities, and the Company had a working capital deficiency of $1.2 million.\n\nOn June 24, 2024, the Company received a Staff Listing Determination Letter from Nasdaq pursuant to which the Staff has determined that as of June 21, 2024, the Company’s common shares had a per share closing bid price of $0.10 or less for ten consecutive trading days (the Company’s bid price has closed at or below $0.10 per share from June 6, 2024, through June 21, 2024). Nasdaq has granted the Company an exception to comply with the bid price rule as follows:\n\n1. | On or before November 27, 2024, the Company shall obtain shareholders approval for a reverse stock split at a ratio that satisfies the minimum requirement in the Bid Price Rule;  \n---|---  \n2. | On or before December 4, 2024, the Company shall effect a reverse stock split and, thereafter, maintain a $1 closing bid price for a minimum of ten consecutive business days;  \n3. | On or before December 17, 2024, the Company shall have demonstrated compliance with the Bid Price Rule, by evidencing a closing bid price of $1 or more per share for a minimum of ten consecutive trading sessions.  \n  \nTo meet these requirements, the Company is holding its previously postponed Annual Meeting of Shareholders on November 25, 2024, and assuming shareholder approval, will effect a reverse split immediately thereafter.\n\nThe accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The interim financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company is at the development stage of its business plan. As such it is likely that additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to develop and commercialize its technology. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. For the next twelve months from issuance of these interim financial statements, the Company plans to seek to obtain additional capital through the sale of debt or equity financings or other arrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing shareholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to our currently outstanding common shares. If the Company is unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. Due to the uncertainty in the Company’s ability to raise capital, management believes that there is substantial doubt in the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these interim financial statements.\n\n**_Reverse Stock Split_**\n\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company executed a one-for-fifty reverse stock split of the Company’s common shares (the “Reverse Split”). As a result of the Reverse Split, every 50 shares of the Company’s old common shares were converted into one share of the Company’s new common shares. Fractional shares resulting from the reverse split were rounded up to the nearest whole number. The Reverse Split automatically and proportionately adjusted all issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common shares, as well as convertible debentures, convertible features, prefunded warrants, stock options and warrants outstanding at the time of the date of the Reverse Split. The exercise price on outstanding equity based-grants was proportionately increased, while the number of shares available under the Company’s equity-based plans was proportionately reduced. Share and per share data (except par value) for the periods presented reflect the effects of the Reverse Split. References to numbers of common shares and per share data in the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto for periods ended prior to October 11, 2023 have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split on a retroactive basis.\n\n**2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n**_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_**\n\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Start-ups Act of 2012, (the “JOBS Act”). Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\n\nIn November 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 820): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” ASU 2023-07 provides guidance to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on our financial statements.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” ASU 2023-09 requires companies to provide enhanced rate reconciliation disclosures, including disclosure of specific categories and additional information for reconciling items. The standard also requires companies to disaggregate income taxes paid by federal, state and foreign taxes. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective or prospective basis. We are currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on our financial statements.\n\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\n\n**_Inventories_**\n\nInventories consist of work-in-progress hydroxyl devices and finished goods of milled flour and related packaging material recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value with the cost measured using the average cost method. Inventories includes all costs that relate to bringing the inventory to its present condition and location under normal operating conditions.\n\n**_Revenue Recognition_**\n\nProduct revenue was limited to sales from hydroxyl generators and, we believe, will expand to include sales of our UN(THINK) Foods products in 2025. We recognize product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations by transferring control of the promised products or services to customers. Product revenue is recognized at a point in time when control of the promised good or service is transferred to the customer, which is at the point of shipment or delivery of the goods.\n\n**_Convertible Instruments_**\n\nThe Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”), which provides that if three criteria are met, the Company is required to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which;\n\n(a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract;\n\n(b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur; and\n\n(c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.\n\nASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional as defined under professional standards as “The Meaning of Conventional Convertible Debt Instrument”. Accordingly, the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records when necessary deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. ASC 815 provides that, among other things, generally, if an event is not within the entity’s control or could require net cash settlement, then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \n**_Foreign Currency Transactions_**\n\nThe financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the local currencies are translated into USD for consolidation as follows: assets and liabilities at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, shareholders’ equity at the historical rates of exchange, and income and expense amounts at the average exchange rate for the period. Translation adjustments resulting from the translation of the subsidiaries’ accounts are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income” as equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the reporting currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included within non-operating expenses.\n\n**_Definite Lived Intangible Assets_**\n\nDefinite lived intangible assets consist of a granted patent and intangible assets acquired from an acquisition. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset (Note 6).\n\n**_Impairment of Long-Lived Assets_**\n\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In order to determine if assets have been impaired, assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable independent cash flows are available (“asset group”). An impairment loss is recognized when the sum of projected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group. Fair value can be determined using a market approach, income approach or cost approach. The reversal of impairment losses is prohibited.\n\n**_Loss per Share_**\n\nThe Company presents basic and diluted loss per share data for its common shares. Basic loss per common share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The number of common shares used in the loss per shares calculation includes all outstanding common shares plus all common shares issuable for which there are no conditions to issue other than time. Diluted loss per common share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of common shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive share equivalents, such as stock options and warrants and assumes the receipt of proceeds upon exercise of the dilutive securities to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased at the average market price during the year.\n\n**_Fair Value Accounting_**\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturities of these items.\n\nAs part of the issuance of debentures on June 30, 2022, January 17, 2023, October 18, 2023, November 30, 2023, February 21, 2024, April 11, 2024 and May 22, 2024 as well as the private placement on June 20, 2023, the Company issued warrants having strike prices denominated in USD. This creates an obligation to issue shares for a price that is not denominated in the Company’s functional currency and renders the warrants not indexed to the Company’s stock, and therefore, must be classified as a derivative liability and measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. On the same basis, the Series A Warrants and the representative warrants issued as part of the IPO are also classified as a derivative liability and measured at fair value.\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s warrants is determined in accordance with FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” which establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the assumptions (inputs) to valuation techniques used to price assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The guidance for fair value measurements requires that assets and liabilities measured at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\n\n● | Level 1: Defined as observable inputs, such as quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   \n---|---  \n  \n12  \n---  \n  \n● | Level 2: Defined as observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. This includes quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.   \n---|---  \n● | Level 3: Defined as unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.  \n  \n**_Reclassifications_**\n\nThe Company has reclassified certain share base payment expenses from _Wages and salaries_ to _Share based compensation_ in the 2023 consolidated statements of comprehensive loss to align with the 2024 presentation.\n\n**3. BUSINESS COMBINATION**\n\nOn August 16, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of assets of Radical Clean Solutions, Inc. (“RCS”), effectively increasing its interest from 14% to 100%, and providing the Company control over RCS. The RCS technology is a product line consisting of patent-pending “smart hydroxyl generation systems” focused on numerous industry verticals that is proven to eliminate 99.99+% of all major pathogens, virus, mold, volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) and allergy triggers. As the Company’s investment in RCS does not have a readily determinable fair value, the Company previously elected to account for its 14% interest in RCS at cost, less impairment. The Company recognized a loss on the investment of $97,488 during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe acquired business did not contribute revenues or earnings to the Company for the period from August 16, 2024 to September 30, 2024. The following unaudited pro forma summary presents consolidated information of the Company as if the business combination had occurred on January 1, 2023.\n\nSCHEDULE OF UNAUDITED PRO FORMA INFORMATION\n\nPro forma nine months ended September 30, 2024 | Pro forma year ended December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nRevenue | 41,315 | 262,991  \nNet loss | 13,407,164 | 11,740,635  \n  \nThe Company did not have any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and net loss position.\n\nThese pro forma amounts have been calculated after applying the Company’s accounting policies and adjusting the results of RCS to reflect the additional amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to the intangible assets had been applied from August 1, 2024, with the consequential tax effects.\n\nThe following table summarizes the consideration transferred to acquire RCS and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.\n\nSCHEDULE OF IDENTIFIED ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED\n\nNote payable forgiven | 202,093  \n---|---  \nConvertible debentures repaid on behalf of RCS | 153,986  \nCommon shares | 295,000  \nContingent consideration | 79,000  \nPreviously invested equity | 118,850  \nPurchase price | $| 848,929  \n  \n13  \n---  \n  \nAugust 16, 2024  \n---  \nPurchase price | 848,929  \nAssets acquired  \nIn-process research and development | 300,000  \nTrademark | 10,000  \nBrand logo | 10,000  \nWeb domain | 10,000  \nCustomer list | 138,000  \nDevice firmware and software | 50,000  \nBlueprints | 20,000  \nIntangible assets | 20,000  \nFair value of identified net assets acquired | 538,000  \nGoodwill acquired on acquisition | $| 310,929  \n  \nThe acquisition of RCS includes a contingent consideration arrangement that requires additional consideration to be paid by AgriFORCE to a previous owner of RCS who now serves as a Consultant to AgriFORCE (the “Consultant”). The Consultant is entitled to receive commissions on sales and production of RCS Units, which are payable in cash upon receipt of revenue or completed inventory by the Company. The consultant is also entitled to other manufacturing, sales and product development milestones, which are outlined below.\n\n(a) Completion of wall mount design\n\n(b) Completion of patent prosecution for any of the patent applications heretofore provided to Company or any new U.S. patent applications\n\n(c) Execute distribution agreements for other countries or verticals\n\n(d) Production of 250 RCS units\n\n(e) Production of 500 RCS units\n\n(f) Production of 1,000 RCS units\n\nThe Consultant is entitled to be awarded 25,000 restricted common shares of the Company for meeting each milestone.\n\nThe Consultant is also entitled to restricted stock units (“RSUs”) provided certain conditions are met. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no changes in the recognized amounts or range of outcomes for the contingent consideration recognized as a result of the acquisition of RCS.\n\nThe goodwill is attributable to the acquisition of the RCS technologies, synergies, access to their key vendors, and other non-quantifiable assets which are expected to create growth and diversification opportunities for the Company.\n\nPrior to the acquisition, the Company had a preexisting relationship with RCS. The Company was a 14% investor of RCS and held a receivable of $200,000 for a secured loan note issued to RCS. As part of the acquisition terms, the receivable amount of $200,000 funded the purchase price consideration and was deemed settled.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \n**4. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS**\n\nSCHEDULE OF PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nLegal retainer | 31,986 | 8,039  \nPrepaid expenses | 280,291 | 223,624  \nInventory advances | 112,463 | 30,654  \nOthers | 74,942 | 10,555  \nPrepaid expenses, other current assets | $| 499,682 | $| 272,872  \n  \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company wrote off a non-refundable deposit amounting to $12,000 which was related to a land purchase agreement.\n\n**5. INVENTORIES**\n\nAs at September 30, 2024, the Company had $47,174 in work-in-progress inventory (December 31, 2023 – $38,857 in finished goods).\n\n**6. INTANGIBLE ASSETS**\n\nIntangible assets include $7,832,200 (December 31, 2023 - $12,733,885) for intellectual property (“Manna IP”) acquired under an asset purchase agreement with Manna Nutritional Group, LLC (“Manna”) dated September 10, 2021. The Manna IP encompasses patented technologies to naturally process and convert grains, pulses, and root vegetables, into low-starch, low-sugar, high-protein, fiber-rich baking flour products, as well as a wide range of breakfast cereals, juices, natural sweeteners, and baking enhancers. The Company paid $1,475,000 in cash and issued 147,600 prefunded warrants valued at $12,106,677 (the “Purchase Price”). Subject to a 9.99% blocker and SEC Rule 144 restrictions, the prefunded warrants vested in tranches up until March 10, 2024, at which time all tranches were fully vested. When vested the tranches of prefunded warrants became convertible into an equal number of common shares.\n\nOn January 3, 2023, Manna satisfied all of its contractual obligations when the patent was approved by the US Patent and Trademark Office and the title was transferred to the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued 141,175 shares in relation to this transaction. As at September 30, 2024 all prefunded warrants had been converted (December 31, 2023 - 6,425 unconverted prefunded warrants).\n\nBased on the terms above and in conformity with US GAAP, the Company accounted for purchase as an asset acquisition. The asset was available for use on January 3, 2023. The asset has a useful life of 20 years. The Company recorded $488,752 in amortization expense related to the Manna IP for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (September 30, 2023 - $492,220).\n\n15  \n---  \n  \nAs at September 30, 2024, the Company determined that there was an indicator of impairment for the intangible assets due to the significant decline in the Company’s stock price as at September 30, 2024. As a result, the Company performed an interim intangible impairment test and determined that the fair value of the intangible asset was $7,832,200 based on an income approach using the Company’s estimated discounted cashflows. For valuing the Manna IP, the Company used the following assumption: discount rate 28%. The Company recorded an asset impairment loss of $4,137,271 in operating expenses.\n\nThe Company acquired intangible assets from RCS as part of the business combination (Note 3). The following intangible assets were acquired from RCS:\n\nSCHEDULE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED FROM RCS\n\nWeighted Average Useful Life (Years)  \n---  \nIn-process research and development | Term of the patent | 300,000  \nTrademark | 10 | 10,000  \nBrand logo | 10 | 10,000  \nWeb domain | 5 | 10,000  \nCustomer list | 5 | 138,000  \nDevice firmware and software | 5 | 50,000  \nRCS blueprints | 5 | 20,000  \nIdentified assets acquired, goodwill and liabilities assumed | $| 538,000  \n  \nThe estimated annual amortization expense for the next five years are as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF FUTURE AMORTIZATION EXPENSE\n\nPeriod ending: | Amount  \n---|---  \nRemaining 2024 | $| 159,312  \n2025 | 656,174  \n2026 | 656,174  \n2027 | 656,174  \n2028 | 656,174  \n2029 | 639,643  \nThereafter | 4,946,772  \nTotal | $| 8,370,423  \n  \n**7. INVESTMENT**\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the Company signed a memorandum of understanding with Radical Clean Solutions Ltd. (“RCS”) to purchase common shares issued by RCS. The Company paid RCS $225,000 for 14% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company. Under the terms of the MOU, the use of proceeds is exclusively for the advance purchase of hydroxyls generating devices for commercial sales into controlled environment agriculture, food manufacturing, warehousing and transportation verticals. The Company was to receive one of five board of director seats of RCS and had a right of first refusal to maintain an ownership percentage in RCS of not less than 10% of the total issued and outstanding common shares. On October 1, 2023 the Company and RCS signed a definitive agreement to convert the advance into a 14% ownership investment in RCS.\n\nOn August 16, 2024, the Company acquired the assets of RCS as part of a business combination. The investment in RCS was accounted for as part of the step-acquisition accounting (Note 3). As at September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the investment in RCS was $nil (December 31, 2023 - $223,801).\n\n16  \n---  \n  \n**8. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES**\n\nSCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nAccounts payable | $| 612,070 | $| 578,128  \nAccrued expenses | 962,496 | 868,451  \nOthers | 450,055 | 495,432  \nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities | $| 2,024,621 | $| 1,942,011  \n  \n**9. DEBENTURES**\n\nOn June 30, 2022, the Company executed the definitive agreements (the “Purchase Agreements”) with arm’s length accredited institutional investors (the “Investors”) for $14,025,000 in debentures with a 10% original issue discount for gross proceeds of $12,750,000 (“First Tranche Debentures”). The First Tranche Debentures were convertible into common shares at $111.00 per share. In addition, the Investors received 82,129 warrants at a strike price of $122.10, which expire on December 31, 2025 (the “First Tranche Warrants”). The First Tranche Warrants and First Tranche Debentures each have down round provisions whereby the conversion and strike prices will be adjusted downward if the Company issues equity instruments at lower prices. The First Tranche Warrants strike price and the First Tranche Debenture conversion price will be adjusted down to the effective conversion price of the issued equity instruments. The transaction costs incurred in relation to first tranche were $1,634,894. The Debentures are senior to all other indebtedness or claims in right of payment, other than indebtedness secured by purchase money security interested.\n\nThe Investors had the right to purchase additional tranches of $5,000,000 each, up to a total additional principal amount of $33,000,000.\n\nOn January 17, 2023, the Investors purchased additional debentures totaling $5,076,923 with a 10% original issue discount for gross proceeds of $4,615,385 (the “Second Tranche Debenture”). The Second Tranche Debentures were convertible into common shares at $62.00 per share and the Investors received an additional 53,226 warrants at a strike price of $62.00, which expire on December 31, 2025 (the “Second Tranche Warrants”). The issuance of the additional tranche triggered the down round provision, adjusting the exercise prices of the First Tranche Debentures and the First Tranche Warrants to $62.00. The transaction costs incurred in relation to second tranche were $325,962.\n\nOn June 26, 2023, the Company entered into waiver and amendment agreements (“Debenture Modification Agreements”) with the Investors to modify terms of the Purchase Agreements. The Debenture Modification Agreements provide as follows:\n\n1. | The July 1, 2023 interest and principal payments will be settled with the Company’s Common Shares  \n---|---  \n2. | The Conversion Price has been reduced to the lower of $22.50 or the price of subsequent dilutive issuances under the Company’s ATM program.  \n3. | 100% of ATM proceeds up to $1 million USD may be kept by Company, while any dollar amount over this threshold will be distributed 33% to the Company and 67% to the Investors.  \n4. | The minimum tranche value for Additional Closings has been reduced from $5.0 million to $2.5 million.  \n5. | The Investors have each agreed to raise no objection to one or more private placements of securities by the Company with an aggregate purchase price of up to $1,000,000 at a purchase price of at least $12.50 per common share and two-year warrant (with a per share exercise price of $25.00, and no registration rights).  \n6. | The Company may not prepay any portion of the principal amount of this Debenture without the prior written consent of the Investor; However the Company must apply the approved or percentage of approved gross proceeds from the sale of its Common Stock from an at-the-market offering to prepay this Debenture (pro-rated among all Debentures) and shall be permitted to prepay the Debentures notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Debenture or the Purchase Agreement.  \n  \n17  \n---  \n  \nOn August 9, 2023, the Company entered into another waiver and amendment agreement (“Agreement”) with the Investors with respect to a certain Senior Convertible Debenture (the “Debentures”) due July 17, 2025 issued by the Company to that Investor. The Agreement provides as follows:\n\n1. | The Company wishes to make Monthly Redemptions in shares of the Company’s Common Stock in lieu of cash payments, until further written notice from the Company to the Purchaser.  \n---|---  \n2. | The Purchaser is willing to accept such shares as payment of the Monthly Redemption Amount provided that the Equity Conditions are met; and will consider on a case-by-case basis accepting payments in shares of Common Stock if the Equity Conditions are not met, at its sole discretion. The Company may inquire of the Purchaser at least five (5) Trading Days prior to a Monthly Redemption Date whether the Purchaser is willing to accept Shares without the Equity Conditions having been met. An email reply from the Purchaser shall be sufficient evidence of such monthly waiver.  \n3. | The Purchaser will accept the August 1, 2023 Monthly Redemption Amount in shares of Common Stock valued at the August 1 Repayment Price for such date.  \n  \nOn October 18, 2023, the Investors purchased additional debentures totaling $2,750,000 with a 10% original issue discount for gross proceeds of $2,500,000 (the “Third Tranche Debenture”). The Third Tranche Debentures were convertible into common shares at $2.62 per share and the Investors received an additional 620,230 warrants at a strike price of $2.62, which expire on April 18, 2027 (the “Third Tranche Warrants”). The issuance of the additional tranche triggered the down round provision, adjusting the exercise prices of the First and Second Tranche Debentures and the First and Second Tranche Warrants to $2.62. The transaction costs incurred in relation to third tranche were $31,915.\n\nOn November 30, 2023, the Investors purchased additional debentures totaling $2,750,000 with a 10% original issue discount for gross proceeds of $2,500,000 (the “Fourth Tranche Debenture”). The Fourth Tranche Debentures were convertible into common shares at $0.90 per share and the Investors received an additional 1,986,112 warrants at a strike price of $0.90, which expire on May 30, 2027 (the “Fourth Tranche Warrants”). The issuance of the additional tranche triggered the down round provision, adjusting the exercise prices of the First, Second and Third Tranche Debentures and the First, Second and Third Tranche Warrants to $0.90. The transaction costs incurred in relation to fourth tranche were $30,040.\n\nOn February 21, 2024, the Investors purchased additional debentures totaling $1,100,000 with a 10% original issue discount for gross proceeds of $1,000,000 (the “Fifth Tranche Debenture”). The Fifth Tranche Debentures were convertible into common shares at $0.214 per share and the Investors received an additional 3,341,122 warrants at a strike price of $0.2354, which expire on August 21, 2027 (the “Fifth Tranche Warrants”). The issuance of the additional tranche triggered the down round provision, adjusting the exercise prices of the First, Second, Third and Fourth Tranche Debentures and the First, Second, Third and Fourth Tranche Warrants to $0.214. The transaction costs incurred in relation to fifth tranche were $50,000.\n\nOn April 11, 2024, the Investors purchased additional debentures totaling $550,000 with a 10% original issue discount for gross proceeds of $500,000 (the “Sixth Tranche Debenture”). The Sixth Tranche Debentures were convertible into common shares at $0.163 per share and the Investors received an additional 2,193,253 warrants at a strike price of $0.18, which expire on October 11, 2027 (the “Sixth Tranche Warrants”). The issuance of the additional tranche triggered the down round provision, adjusting the exercise prices of the First, Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Tranche Debentures and Warrants to $0.163. The transaction costs incurred in relation to sixth tranche were $31,309.\n\nOn May 22, 2024, the Investors purchased additional debentures totaling $833,000 with a 10% original issue discount for gross proceeds of $750,000 (the “Seventh Tranche Debenture”).

Mr. Mueller alleges to have suffered damages including, among other things, a loss of base salary of $473,367 CAD per annum and damages from not receiving common stock of AgriFORCE equivalent in value to $468,313 CAD. AgriFORCE’s position is that Mr. Mueller was terminated for ‘just cause’ because he breached his fiduciary duty to act in AgriFORCE’s best interest by, among other things, submitting a sizeable bid for the acquisition of a company without first obtaining Board approval. In doing so, Mr. Mueller misrepresented AgriFORCE’s financial standing and forged, or instructed others to forge, a document by affixing the electronic signature of AgriFORCE’s CFO.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the parties were in the discovery stage of litigation. AgriFORCE has produced relevant documents to Mr. Mueller, and is awaiting Mr. Mueller’s production of relevant documents. The parties are also in the process of scheduling examinations for discovery. Management is instructing counsel to advance the matter given the relative strength of AgriFORCE’s case.\n\nThe likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is relatively low given the facts supporting AgriFORCE’s ‘for cause’ termination of Mr. Mueller as well as the significant expense that Mr. Mueller would have to incur to advance this matter to trial.\n\nOn September 13, 2023, Stronghold filed a Complaint with the Superior Court of California for Breach of Contract; Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; and Common Count: Goods and Services Rendered in relation to the purchase and sale agreement for the Coachella property. Stronghold alleges that AgriFORCE breached the PSA by failing to deposit certain stocks certificates into Escrow, failing to pay amounts owed for its costs incurred in connection with the Sellers Work, and for terminating the PSA despite Stronghold’s performance of the Sellers Work. Stronghold is claiming $451,684 plus interest in damages based on invoices it provided. AgriFORCE will dispute, among other things, the amount and invoices, estimating approximately $230,000 as Stronghold’s true expenses that may be claimed. The Company filed their answer on February 26, 2024. The parties have agreed to go into mediation.\n\nOn March 27, 2024, BV Peeters Advocaten-Avocats (“Peeters”) summoned the Company to appear on May 31, 2024 at the First Chamber of the Dutch-Speaking Division of the Business Court in Brussels. Peeters is seeking payment for €467,249 of unpaid bills for legal services plus penalties and interest. The Company believes that Peeters performed actions that were not in the Company’s best interest. The Company does not intend to pay the outstanding legal bills and intends to vigorously defend its position in court. The parties have agreed to go into mediation.\n\nOn July 11, 2024, AgriFORCE’s former General Counsel filed a Notice of Civil Claim with the Supreme Court of British Columbia, in which he alleges that AgriFORCE wrongfully terminated his employment without notice, in breach of the parties’ underlying employment agreement. Former General Counsel alleges to have suffered damages including, among other things, a loss of base salary of $250,000 CAD per annum, damages from not receiving common stock of AgriFORCE equivalent in value to $62,500 CAD, and damages from not receiving entitlement to the Company’s short-term incentive bonus of $90,563 CAD and participation in the Company’s long-term incentive stock option program, and participation in the Company’s Group Benefits plan. The Company filed a response to the claim on August 2, 2024. AgriFORCE’s position is that General Counsel was terminated for ‘just cause’.

The Company’s registered and records office address is at 800 – 525 West 8th Avenue, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V5Z 1C6.\n\n**Our Business**\n\nAgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. (“AgriFORCE™” or the “Company”) was incorporated as a private company by Articles of Incorporation issued pursuant to the provisions of the _Business Corporations Act (British Columbia)_ on December 22, 2017. The Company’s registered and records office address is at 800 – 525 West 8th Avenue, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V5Z 1C6.\n\nThe Company is an innovative sustainable technology focused company that strives to innovate and deliver sustainable technology solutions across a wide array of verticals utilization of our proprietary intellectual property to businesses and enterprises through our AgriFORCE™ Solutions division (“Solutions”) and deliver innovative flour products through our AgriFORCE™ Brands division (“Brands”). To this end, we announce the next phase of our transition, highlighted by the intended integration of Bitcoin mining solutions and the ancillary environmental and power-generation benefits that result from engaging in that business. We recognize the potential of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in facilitating sustainable financial transactions and intend to utilize 10-20% of our future capital raised to purchase and hold Bitcoin. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company bought the assets of the Radical Clean Solutions (“RCS”) business for which it had bought an exclusive license to the agricultural industry in 2023. During 2023, the Company launched its UN(THINK) Awakened Flour™, which is a nutritious flour that we believe provides health advantages over traditional flour.\n\nWhile Solutions’ legacy focus was to operate in the plant based pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and other high value crop markets using its unique proprietary facility design and hydroponics based automated growing system that enable cultivators to effectively grow crops in a controlled environment (“FORCEGH+™”). it has changed its focus to broaden the use of its proprietary intellectual property across multiple industries. For instance, the Company through its RCS purchase is not able to utilize that technology to deliver solutions across multiple industries, including not only agriculture, but other industries including hospitality, commercial applications, education institutions, residential real estate and transportation.\n\nBrands is focused on the development and commercialization of plant-based ingredients and products that deliver healthier and more nutritious solutions. We strive to market and commercialize both branded consumer product offerings and ingredient supply.\n\n**AgriFORCE™ Brands**\n\n_UN(THINK)™ Foods_\n\nThe Company purchased Intellectual Property (“IP”) from Manna Nutritional Group, LLC (“Manna”), a privately held firm based in Boise, Idaho on September 10, 2021. The IP encompasses a granted patent to naturally process and convert grain, pulses and root vegetables, resulting in low-starch, low-sugar, high-protein, fiber-rich baking flour as well as produces a natural sweetener juice. The core process is covered under Patent Nr. 11,540,538 in the U.S. and key international markets. The all-natural process is designed to unlock nutritional properties, flavors, and other qualities in a range of modern, ancient and heritage grains, pulses and root vegetables to create specialized all-natural baking and all-purpose flours, sweeteners, juices, naturally sweet cereals and other valuation products, providing numerous opportunities for dietary nutritional, performance and culinary applications.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has achieved milestones towards the commercialization of our UN(THINK) Awakened Flour™ flour, the Company’s first line of products to utilize the IP. Management has defined and tested its quality controls and safety protocols for production, and produced several multi-ton batches of germinated grains, refining and scaling production processes with our partners in Canada. We are also in the process of qualifying partners in the US to establish additional production hubs – at no additional CAPEX - which will support growth and reduce logistics costs for customers in the region. Additionally, we have established our supply chain logistics with a contracted shipping company and two warehouses in Canada and the US. Our commercial team made progress in defining pricing and is starting to approach US and Canadian Bakeries and Baked Goods Companies who are now testing our new flours for integration into their manufacturing operations and innovation pipeline. Online sales logistics and advertising materials were developed during the period to support the establishment of the direct-to-consumer sales channel which will be started once the Business to Business channel sales will ramp up. Lastly, the Company has developed an extensive number of recipes for the application of Awakened Flour™ product line for both customers and consumers.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n_Wheat and Flour Market_\n\nModern diet is believed to be a contributor to health risks such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity, due in part to the consumption of highly processed foods that are low in natural fiber, protein and nutrition; and extremely high in simple starch, sugar and calories. These “empty carbs” produce glycemic swings that may cause overeating by triggering cravings for food high in sugar, salt and starch. As an example, conventional baking flour is low in natural fiber (~ 2-3%), low-to-average in protein (~ 9%), and very high in starch (~ 75%)(1). Apart from dietary fiber, whole flour is only marginally better in terms of these macronutrients (2).\n\nIn contrast, foods high in fiber help to satiate hunger, suppress cravings and raise metabolism(3). They also assist in weight loss, lower cholesterol, and may reduce the risk of cancer, heart disease and diabetes(4).\n\n_Advantages of the UN(THINK)™ Foods IP_\n\nOur Controlled Enzymatic Reaction & Endothermic Saccharification with Managed Natural Germination (“CERES-MNG”) patented process allows for the development and manufacturing of all-natural flours that are significantly higher in fibers, nutrients and proteins and significantly lower in carbohydrates and calories than standard baking flour.\n\nCERES-MNG baking flour produced from soft white wheat has 40 times more fiber, three (3) times more protein and 75% less net carbohydrates than regular all- purpose flour(5).\n\n**![](form10-q_002.jpg)**\n\nSource: Independent analysis by Eurofins Food Chemistry Testing Madison, Inc, February 2022\n\nThe CERES-MNG patent will help develop new flours and products from modern, ancient and heritage grains, seeds, legumes and tubers/root vegetables.\n\nProducts that AgriFORCE™ intends to develop for commercialization from the CERES-MNG patented process under the UN(THINK)™ foods brand:\n\n- | High protein, high fiber, low carb modern, heritage and ancient grain flours (for use in breads, baked goods, doughs, pastry, snacks, and pasta)  \n---|---  \n- | Protein flours and protein additives  \n- | High protein, high fiber, low carb cereals and snacks  \n- | High protein, high fiber, low carb oat based dairy alternatives  \n- | Better tasting, cleaner label, high protein, high fiber, low carb nutrition bars  \n- | High protein, high fiber, low carb nutrition juices  \n- | Sweeteners – liquid and granulated  \n- | High protein, high fiber, low carb pet foods and snacks  \n  \n(1) Based on protein, fiber, and starch content results from a nationally certified independent laboratory, as compared to standard all-purpose flour.\n\n(2) https://www.soupersage.com/compare-nutrition/flour-vs-whole-wheat-flour\n\n(3) https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/14400-improving-your-health-with-fiber\n\n(4) https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fiber-full-eating-for-better-health-and-lower-cholesterol-2019062416819\n\n(5) Based on protein, fiber, and starch content results from a nationally certified independent laboratory, as compared to standard all-purpose flour.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \nWe intend to commercialize these products behind two (2) main sales channels:\n\n- | Branded ingredients (B2B)  \n---|---  \n- | Consumer branded products (B2B and B2C)  \n  \nTo produce the UN(THINK)™ power wheat flour, we are using our patented process to develop a new germinated whole grain wheat flour, which we have qualified and made available for sale through November 2023 in Canada and the USA, under the UN(THINK)™ Awakened Flour™ brand. This new Awakened Grains™ flour – available in 3 types: hard white wheat and hard red wheat for breads and soft white wheat for bakery and pastries – will provide enhanced nutrition with over five times more fiber, up to two times more protein and 23% less net carbs versus conventional all-purpose flour (source: Eurofins Food Chemistry Madison, Inc, December 2022).\n\n_GROWTH PLAN_\n\nAgriFORCE™’s organic growth plan is to actively establish and deploy the commercialization of products in four distinct phases:\n\nPHASE 1 (COMPLETED):\n\n● | Product and process testing and validation. (_completed_)  \n---|---  \n● | Filing of US and international patents. (_completed_)  \n● | Creation of the UN(THINK)™ foods brand.

We are taking modern technologies such as artificial intelligence (“AI”) and blockchain–based advances to bring what is traditionally a low technology industry into the 21st century. This approach means that we are able to reach into areas not readily available to agricultural businesses in the past, such as advanced Fintech to enhance financing capabilities for these businesses and more readily provide advanced intelligence for farmers. These technologies can also be applied to worldwide sourcing and matching food producers to consumers in an efficient manner.\n\nOur intellectual property combines a patented uniquely engineered facility design and automated growing system to solve excessive water loss and high energy consumption, two problems plaguing nearly all controlled environment agriculture systems. FORCEGH+ delivers a patented clean, sealed, self-contained micro-environment that maximizes natural sunlight and offers supplemental LED lighting. It limits human intervention and is designed to provide superior quality control through AI optical technology. It was also created to drastically reduce environmental impact, substantially decrease utility demands, conserving water, while delivering customers daily harvests and higher crop yields.\n\nThe Ag-Tech sector is severely underserved by the capital markets, and we see an opportunity to acquire global companies who have provided solutions to the industry and are leading innovation moving forward. The robustness of our engagement with potential targets has confirmed our belief and desire to be part of a larger integrated Ag-Tech solutions provider, where each separate element of the business has its existing legacy business and can leverage across areas of expertise to expand their business footprint.\n\n_BUSINESS PLAN_\n\nThe Company will launch a full line up of Hydroxyl Devices and start commercializing the Hydroxyl Devises into the US market of CEA and Food Manufacturing. The Company will identify and establish exclusive distribution agreement for the EMEA region as well Expand Distribution Network into Latin America and Asia. The Company will also advance on the commercialization of our Hydroxyl clean room systems to greatly reduce the spread of pathogens, mold and disease at processing facilities worldwide.\n\nThe Company is exploring opportunities to utilize its patented FORCEGH+™ structure and its related technologies in joint ventures and licensing. The Company is also studying the utilization of FORCEGH+ technologies in arctic, tropical and desert environments. The Company intends to continue development of and license of its technology to existing farmers in the plant based pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and high value crop markets using its unique patented facility design and hydroponics based automated growing system that enable farmers to effectively grow crops in a sealed controlled environment (“FORCEGH+™”).\n\nThe Company also looks to expand its efforts into development of blockchain solutions and the implementation of these solutions into FinTech systems to allow quicker and less costly transactions between commercial farmers.\n\nThe Company is exploring opportunities to utilize its patented FORCEGH+™ structure and its related technologies in joint ventures and licensing. The Company is also studying the utilization of FORCEGH+ technologies in arctic, tropical and desert environments and artificial intelligence and blockchain in the development and implementation of FinTech systems to commercial farmers, and advancing on the commercialization of our Hydroxyl clean room systems to greatly reduce the spread of pathogens, mold and disease at processing facilities worldwide.\n\n_The AgriFORCE Clean Solutions_\n\nThe Company’s Solutions division is charged with the commercialization of our FORCEGH+ technology and our RCS clean room systems. The Company has also begun to advance its initiative to integrate blockchain in the development and implementation of FinTech systems for commercial farmers.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \nWe own the Radical Clean Solutions, Inc. (“RCS”) technology to commercialize the proprietary hydroxyl generating devices of RCS for the CEA and food manufacturing industries. The RCS technology is a product line consisting of patent-pending “smart hydroxyl generation systems” focused on numerous industry verticals that is proven to eliminate 99.99+% of all major pathogens, virus, mold, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and allergy triggers(6).\n\nOn October 1, 2023, the Company signed a definitive agreement to purchase a 14% ownership stake in RCS, and it purchased all of the RCS assets in August 2024.\n\nThe Company generated its first revenue from the sale of RCS devices in late 2023. During 2023, the Company signed an exclusive distribution agreement with a leading distributor of air conditioning and heating solutions in Mexico for the representation and sale of the AgriFORCE/RCS hydroxyl generating devices for greenhouses and food manufacturing facilities for the territory of Mexico. The first products were delivered in October 2023 pursuant to purchase orders for the products.\n\nThe Company will continue to expand sales into Mexico through its distributor, Commercializadora DESICO. Based on its sale into the poultry industry in Mexico, the Company is expanding its distribution of its Clean System solutions into other Latin American markets and the United States.\n\nOn August 16, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of 86% of the common shares of Radical Clean Solutions, Inc. (“RCS”), increasing its interest from 14% to 100%, and providing the Company control over RCS. RCS became a consolidated subsidiary of the Company on this date.\n\nBUSINESS PLAN\n\n2024\n\n● | Continue introduction into the Mexico market with our exclusive distributor  \n---|---  \n● | Identify and set up exclusive distribution agreements for the EMEA region  \n● | Start commercializing the Hydroxyl Devices into the US market of CEA and Food Manufacturing  \n● | Launch full line up of Hydroxyl Devices : in-Duct HVAC unit, Portable Industrial QuadPro Unit, Small Rooms Wall-Mount unit  \n  \n2025\n\n● | Expand Distribution Network into Latin America and Asia.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Merger and Acquisition (“M &A”)**\n\nThe Company plans to evaluate accretive M&A opportunities of an appropriate scale as it progresses with its ongoing business plans surrounding its already owned IP and improvements thereto. Any M&A propositions must be of a size and scale which works to complement the Company’s ongoing business in terms of allocation of resources.\n\nThe Company intends to focus any M& A activity to targets which are focused in the Ag-Tech space with emphasis on businesses which can also increase our ESG footprint. This refocused M&A strategy will ensure that proper personnel and economic resources are allocated to the Company’s ongoing businesses, while refocusing efforts on synergistic opportunities which work to enhance the Company’s existing assets.\n\n(6) BCI Labs, Gainesville Florida, February 2022; and various institutional studies.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \n**Recent Developments**\n\n_Management Restructuring_\n\nOn January 25, 2024, Troy McClellan, President of AgriFORCE Solutions, submitted a letter of resignation to the Company. On January 25, 2024, the Company accepted his resignation and deemed it effective immediately pursuant to Section 7.3 of his employment agreement with the Company which permits waiver by the Company of Mr. McClellan’s notice period (through March 31, 2024) and corresponding acceleration of the resignation date.\n\nOn February 10, 2024, Richard Wong resumed his original role as Chief Financial Officer in order to focus on finance and accounting matters for the Company. Effective as of the same day, Jolie Kahn was appointed Executive Turnaround Consultant to support the Company’s operational growth and expansion efforts. On June 4, 2024, the Board Directors appointed Jolie Kahn as Chief Executive Officer. Jolie Kahn shall report to David Welch, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, who shall act as Executive Chairman until such time as a permanent Chief Executive Officer is appointed.\n\nOn February 19, 2024, Margaret Honey resigned as a Director of (the “Company”) to pursue other interests. The resignation is not the result of any disagreement with the Company.\n\nOn June 4, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Jolie Kahn as Chief Executive Officer. Previously, on February 10, 2024, Jolie Kahn was appointed Executive Turnaround Consultant to support the Company’s operational growth and expansion efforts. Jolie Kahn will continue to support these efforts and to report to the Board of Directors of the Company.\n\n_Share Repurchase Program_\n\nOn June 17, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”) under which the Company may repurchase up to $1 million of its outstanding common shares, for a period of six months, subject to contractual requirements. The Board will periodically review the Company’s Repurchase Program and may decide to extend its term or increase the authorized amount.\n\n_RCS Acquisition_\n\nWe purchased all of the assets of RCS in August 2024. A discussion of the acquisition is set forth above in footnote 3 to our financial statements included herein.\n\n**Status as an Emerging Growth Company**\n\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for private companies.\n\n29  \n---  \n  \nWe are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an “emerging growth company,” we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions from, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (a) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the initial public offering, (b) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (c) the last day of our fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act (which would occur if the market value of our equity securities that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter), or (d) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\n\n**FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023**\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed unaudited financial statements for the interim periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included in this report.\n\n**Revenues**\n\nThe Company sells its products directly to customers and indirectly to customers through sales brokers.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold and delivered 8 hydroxyl generating devices for gross sales of $41,315. There were no such sales in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Operating Expenses**\n\nOperating expenses primarily consist of wages and salaries, professional fees, consulting, office and administration, investor and public relations, research and development, and share-based compensation.\n\nOperating expenses increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 by $3,974,421 or 244% primarily due to the following:\n\n● | Intangible asset impairment increased by $4,137,271 due impairment of the Company’s Manna patent due to the fair value of the asset exceeding the carrying value of the intangible asset, requiring a write-down of the asset. There was no such impairment in 2023.  \n---|---  \n● | Consulting increased by $30,025, due to additional consultants hired during the quarter to assist with sales, product manufacturing, and M&A.  \n● | Office and administrative expenses increased by $93,357 due to the increase in miscellaneous spend for business development and other related expenditures  \n● | Research and development increased by $81,082 due to product development expenses for RCS that occurred after the acquisition on August 16, 2024, no such expenses during 2023.  \n● | Travel and entertainment increased by $19,944 increased international travel for foreign business development.  \n● | Professional fees decreased by $165,333 due to reduced legal fees that were required for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for M&A activity but none for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  \n● | Wages and salaries decreased by $116,721 due to a reduction in staff head count (number of employees reduced from 15 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6 during the three months ended September 30, 2024).  \n● | Share based compensation decreased by $16,985 due to a significant number of option forfeitures from lower staff head count.   \n● | Lease expense decreased $72,479 due to shifting from a short term office lease to a virtual office.  \n● | All other items aggregate to $15,740  \n  \n**Other Expenses / (Income)**\n\nOther expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased due to the following:\n\n● | Change in fair value of derivative liabilities increased by $179,586 due to the Company’s stock price decreasing during the period between June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, resulting in the decreased fair value of the Company’s derivative liabilities and increased gains on the change in fair value.  \n---|---  \n● | Increase in gain on debt extinguishment increased by $75,119 as a result of unscheduled conversions of debentures into the Company’s common shares which triggered extinguishments of debt due to the change of the fair value of the debt after the conversions. There were no debt extinguishments during the three months ended September 30, 2024.   \n● | Increase in loss on long-term investment decreased by $97,488 due to the requirement to the revaluation of the existing investment in RCS prior to the step acquisition. No such loss during the three months ended September 30, 2023.  \n● | Loss on conversion of convertible debt increased by $127,251 due to a significant amount of unscheduled conversions that were issued at a higher premium above the exercise price compared to shares issued during the three months ended September 30, 2023.   \n  \nThis was partially offset by the following:\n\n● | Accretion interest on debentures decreased by $1,595,252 due to a significant amount of debentures being converted to shares during 2024, resulting in less interest accreted during the three months ended June 30, 2024.   \n---|---  \n● | All other items aggregate to $5,109.  \n  \n30  \n---  \n  \nOperating expenses increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 by $722,802 or 10% primarily due to the following:\n\n● | Intangible asset impairment increased by $4,137,271 due to the impairment of the Company’s Manna patent due to the fair value of the asset exceeding the carrying value of the intangible asset, requiring a write-down of the asset.

The Company’s ability to fund operations and make planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations depends on future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions, financial markets, business and other factors. We have recorded a net loss of $13,407,164 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a net loss of $7,740,078 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We have recorded an accumulated deficit of $57,914,468 as of September 30, 2024 and $44,507,304 as of December 31, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $3,429,189 and $5,437,592 respectively.\n\nThe Company held $1,373,294 in cash as at September 30, 2024 as compared to $3,878,578 at December 31, 2023.\n\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\n● | the cost and timing of our regulatory activities, especially the process to obtain regulatory approval for our intellectual properties in the U.S. and in foreign countries  \n---|---  \n● | the costs of R&D activities we undertake to further develop our technology  \n● | the costs of constructing our grow houses, including any impact of complications, delays, and other unknown events  \n● | the costs of commercialization activities, including sales, marketing and production  \n● | the level of working capital required to support our growth  \n● | our need for additional personnel, information technology or other operating infrastructure to support our growth and operations as a public company  \n● | completion of planned acquisitions  \n  \nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company is at the stage of development of its first facility and other IP. As such it is likely that additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to develop and commercialize its technology. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nFor the next twelve months from issuance of these financial statements, the Company will seek to obtain additional capital through the sale of debt or equity financings or other arrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing shareholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to currently outstanding common shares. Issued debt securities may contain covenants and limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders. If the Company is unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. Due to the uncertainty in the Company’s ability to raise capital, management believes that there is substantial doubt in the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements.\n\n**Cash Flows**\n\nThe net cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $3,429,189 compared to $5,437,592 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $2,008,403 was primarily due to the following:\n\n● | Increase in impairment of intangible asset of $4,137 271 due to assessment noted above.  \n---|---  \n● | Increase in loss on long-term investment of $97,488 due to assessment noted above.  \n● | Decrease in cash flow adjustments of $188,463 for share based compensation due to forfeiture of stock options by departed employees.   \n● | Decrease of $3,254,034 in amortization of debt issuance costs for less interest recorded on debentures as the carrying value of the debentures were lower as at September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023.  \n● | Increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets used in operating activities of $571,119 due to utilization of consulting retainers and as well as additional prepayments made during September 30, 2024 for various services.  \n● | Decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $701,115 due to the Company paying down its higher aged trade payables balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  \n  \n32  \n---  \n  \nThis was partially offset by the following:\n\n● | Increase in net loss of $5,667,086 due to operating expenses noted above.  \n---|---  \n● | Non-cash change in fair value of derivative liabilities decreased by $4,960,5139 due to (1) the draw down as well as the extinguishment of conversion feature derivatives as a result of significant conversions of several tranches of debentures, and (2) the Company’s stock price stabilizing during the period between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, resulting in the smaller revaluation adjustment as at September 30, 2024.  \n● | Increase in loss on debt extinguishment cash adjustment by $2,223,250 as a result of unscheduled conversions of debentures into the Company’s common shares which triggered extinguishments of debt due to the change of the fair value of the debt after the conversions. There were no debt extinguishments during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.  \n● | Increase in loss on conversion of convertible debt cash adjustment by $1,086,128 due to a significant amount of unscheduled conversions that resulted in shares issued at a higher premium above the exercise price compared to shares issued during the six months ended September 30, 2023.  \n● | All other items aggregate to $114,429.  \n  \nNet cash used in investing activities was $356,079 for cash consideration paid for the RCS acquisition.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, represents net proceeds from debentures of $2,250,000. This was partially offset by repayments on convertible debentures of $802,282 and financing costs of debentures of $84,463. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, represents net proceeds from debentures of $4,615,385 as well as common shares issued for cash of $1,342,915. This was partially offset by repayments on convertible debentures of $1,741,950, financing costs of debentures of $325,962 and share issuance costs of $153,220.\n\n**Recent Financings**\n\nOn January 17, 2023, the Debenture Investors purchased additional tranches totaling $5,076,923 and received 53,226 warrants.

The Shares were registered pursuant to a prospectus supplement on Form 424(b)(4) (to the Registrant’s Prospectus, Registration No. 333-266722, dated August 18, 2022) filed with the SEC on the same day. Each institutional investor (“Purchaser”) is entering into a securities purchase agreement for $400,000 or 8,000,000 common shares at $0.05 per share. Pursuant to those agreements, the Right of Participation held by Purchaser under Section 4.12 of that certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated June 30, 2022 between the Company and the Purchaser is hereby extended to and including December 31, 2025. If the Company shall sell any shares of its Common Stock pursuant to any at-the-market offering or equity line of credit (however denominated), the Company shall use 25% of the net proceeds from any such sales to repay the principal on any outstanding Debentures (as such term is defined in the June 30, 2022 Securities Purchase Agreement) in accordance with the terms of such Debentures.\n\nFrom November 7, 2024 through November 13, 2024, the Company issued shares for cash under its at-the-market offering (“ATM”).

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**\n\nAs a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this item.\n\n**Item 4. Controls and Procedures**\n\n**_Disclosure Controls and Procedures._**\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management is also required to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework in the 2013 COSO framework. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n\n**_Changes in Internal Controls._**\n\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n\n**_Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures_**\n\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Similarly, an evaluation of controls cannot provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\n\n34  \n---  \n  \n**PART II — OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PREPARATION\nBusiness Overview\nAgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. (“AgriFORCE™” or the “Company”) was incorporated as a private company by Articles of Incorporation issued pursuant to the provisions\nof the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on December 22, 2017. The Company’s registered and records office address is at 800 – 525 West 8th Avenue, Vancouver,\nBritish Columbia, Canada, V5Z 1C6.\nThe Company is an innovative sustainable technology focused company that strives to innovate and deliver sustainable technology solutions across a wide array of verticals\nutilization of our proprietary intellectual property to businesses and enterprises through our AgriFORCE™ Solutions division (“Solutions”) and deliver innovative flour\nproducts through our AgriFORCE™ Brands division (“Brands”). In the third quarter of 2024, the Company bought the assets of the Radical Clean Solutions (“RCS”) business\nfor which it had bought an exclusive license to the agricultural industry in 2023. During 2023, the Company commenced efforts to launch its UN(THINK) Awakened Flour™,\nwhich is a nutritious flour that we believe provides health advantages over traditional flour.\nWhile Solutions’ legacy focus was to operate in the plant based pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and other high value crop markets using its unique proprietary facility design and\nhydroponics based automated growing system that enable cultivators to effectively grow crops in a controlled environment (“FORCEGH+™”). it has changed its focus to\nbroaden the use of its proprietary intellectual property across multiple industries. For instance, the Company through its RCS purchase is not able to utilize that technology to\ndeliver solutions across multiple industries, including not only agriculture, but other industries including hospitality, commercial applications, education institutions, residential\nreal estate and transportation.\nBrands is focused on the development and commercialization of plant-based ingredients and products that deliver healthier and more nutritious solutions. We strive to market\nand commercialize both branded consumer product offerings and ingredient supply.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and related financial information of AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. should be read in\nconjunction with the audited financial statements and the related notes thereto for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included in the Company’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on April 1, 2024. These unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nthe rules and regulations of the United States Securities and SEC for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes\nrequired by the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements.\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying interim financial statements contain all adjustments which are necessary to state fairly the Company’s financial position as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Such adjustments are\nof a normal and recurring nature. The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year\nending December 31, 2024, or for any future period.\n9\nLiquidity and Management’s Plan\nThe Company has incurred substantial operating losses since its inception and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. As reflected in\nthe interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of $13.4 million, $3.4 million of net cash used in operating\nactivities, and the Company had a working capital deficiency of $1.2 million.\nOn June 24, 2024, the Company received a Staff Listing Determination Letter from Nasdaq pursuant to which the Staff has determined that as of June 21, 2024, the Company’s\ncommon shares had a per share closing bid price of $0.10 or less for ten consecutive trading days (the Company’s bid price has closed at or below $0.10 per share from June 6,\n2024, through June 21, 2024). Nasdaq has granted the Company an exception to comply with the bid price rule as follows:\n1. On or before November 27, 2024, the Company shall obtain shareholders approval for a reverse stock split at a ratio that satisfies the minimum requirement in the Bid\nPrice Rule;\n2. On or before December 4, 2024, the Company shall effect a reverse stock split and, thereafter, maintain a $1 closing bid price for a minimum of ten consecutive business\ndays;\n3. On or before December 17, 2024, the Company shall have demonstrated compliance with the Bid Price Rule, by evidencing a closing bid price of $1 or more per share for\na minimum of ten consecutive trading sessions.\nTo meet these requirements, the Company is holding its previously postponed Annual Meeting of Shareholders on November 25, 2024, and assuming shareholder approval, will\neffect a reverse split immediately thereafter.\nThe accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the\nnormal course of business. The interim financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the\namounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company is at the development stage of its business plan. As such it is likely\nthat additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to develop and commercialize its technology. These factors raise substantial doubt about the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern. For the next twelve months from issuance of these interim financial statements, the Company plans to seek to obtain\nadditional capital through the sale of debt or equity financings or other arrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to\nraise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing shareholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and\npreferences compared to our currently outstanding common shares. If the Company is unable to obtain such additional financing, future operations would need to be scaled\nback or discontinued. Due to the uncertainty in the Company’s ability to raise capital, management believes that there is substantial doubt in the Company’s ability to continue\nas a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these interim financial statements.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company executed a one-for-fifty reverse stock split of the Company’s common shares (the “Reverse Split”). As a result of the Reverse Split, every\n50 shares of the Company’s old common shares were converted into one share of the Company’s new common shares. Fractional shares resulting from the reverse split were\nrounded up to the nearest whole number. The Reverse Split automatically and proportionately adjusted all issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common shares, as\nwell as convertible debentures, convertible features, prefunded warrants, stock options and warrants outstanding at the time of the date of the Reverse Split. The exercise price\non outstanding equity based-grants was proportionately increased, while the number of shares available under the Company’s equity-based plans was proportionately reduced.\nShare and per share data (except par value) for the periods presented reflect the effects of the Reverse Split. References to numbers of common shares and per share data in the\naccompanying financial statements and notes thereto for periods ended prior to October 11, 2023 have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split on a retroactive basis.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Start-ups Act\nof 2012, (the “JOBS Act”). Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section\n13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an\nemerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nIn November 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 820): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” ASU 2023-07 provides guidance to\nimprove reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We are currently\nassessing the impact this guidance will have on our financial statements.\n10\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” ASU 2023-09 requires companies to provide\nenhanced rate reconciliation disclosures, including disclosure of specific categories and additional information for reconciling items. The standard also requires companies to\ndisaggregate income taxes paid by federal, state and foreign taxes. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective or\nprospective basis. We are currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on our financial statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the\nconsolidated financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its\nfinancial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nInventories\nInventories consist of work-in-progress hydroxyl devices and finished goods of milled flour and related packaging material recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value\nwith the cost measured using the average cost method. Inventories includes all costs that relate to bringing the inventory to its present condition and location under normal\noperating conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nProduct revenue was limited to sales from hydroxyl generators and, we believe, will expand to include sales of our UN(THINK) Foods products in 2025. We recognize product\nrevenue when we satisfy performance obligations by transferring control of the promised products or services to customers. Product revenue is recognized at a point in time\nwhen control of the promised good or service is transferred to the customer, which is at the point of shipment or delivery of the goods.\nConvertible Instruments\nThe Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”),\nwhich provides that if three criteria are met, the Company is required to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing\nderivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which;\n(a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract;\n(b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally\naccepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur; and\n(c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.\nASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional as defined under professional standards as “The Meaning of\nConventional Convertible Debt Instrument”. Accordingly, the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options\nembedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the\neffective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption.\nThe Company also records when necessary deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the\nfair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. ASC 815 provides that,\namong other things, generally, if an event is not within the entity’s control or could require net cash settlement, then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability.\n11\nForeign Currency Transactions\nThe financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the local currencies are translated into USD for consolidation as follows: assets\nand liabilities at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, shareholders’ equity at the historical rates of exchange, and income and expense amounts at the average\nexchange rate for the period. Translation adjustments resulting from the translation of the subsidiaries’ accounts are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income” as\nequity in the consolidated balance sheets. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the\nexchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the reporting currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet\ndate. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included within non-\noperating expenses.\nDefinite Lived Intangible Assets\nDefinite lived intangible assets consist of a granted patent and intangible assets acquired from an acquisition. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful life of the asset (Note 6).\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In\norder to determine if assets have been impaired, assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable independent cash flows are available (“asset group”). An\nimpairment loss is recognized when the sum of projected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group. The measurement of the impairment loss to\nbe recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group. Fair value can be determined using a market approach, income\napproach or cost approach. The reversal of impairment losses is prohibited.\nLoss per Share\nThe Company presents basic and diluted loss per share data for its common shares. Basic loss per common share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to\ncommon shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The number of common shares used in the loss per\nshares calculation includes all outstanding common shares plus all common shares issuable for which there are no conditions to issue other than time. Diluted loss per common\nshare is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of common shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive share equivalents, such as stock\noptions and warrants and assumes the receipt of proceeds upon exercise of the dilutive securities to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased at the average\nmarket price during the year.\nFair Value Accounting\nThe fair value of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturities of\nthese items.\nAs part of the issuance of debentures on June 30, 2022, January 17, 2023, October 18, 2023, November 30, 2023, February 21, 2024, April 11, 2024 and May 22, 2024 as well\nas the private placement on June 20, 2023, the Company issued warrants having strike prices denominated in USD. This creates an obligation to issue shares for a price that is\nnot denominated in the Company’s functional currency and renders the warrants not indexed to the Company’s stock, and therefore, must be classified as a derivative liability\nand measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. On the same basis, the Series A Warrants and the representative warrants issued as part of the IPO are also\nclassified as a derivative liability and measured at fair value.\nThe fair value of the Company’s warrants is determined in accordance with FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” which establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes\nthe assumptions (inputs) to valuation techniques used to price assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The guidance for fair value measurements requires\nthat assets and liabilities measured at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\n● Level 1: Defined as observable inputs, such as quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n12\n● Level 2: Defined as observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. This includes quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for\nsubstantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n● Level 3: Defined as unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the\nfair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.\nReclassifications\nThe Company has reclassified certain share base payment expenses from Wages and salaries to Share based compensation in the 2023 consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive loss to align with the 2024 presentation.\n3. BUSINESS COMBINATION\nOn August 16, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of assets of Radical Clean Solutions, Inc. (“RCS”), effectively increasing its interest from 14% to 100%, and\nproviding the Company control over RCS. The RCS technology is a product line consisting of patent-pending “smart hydroxyl generation systems” focused on numerous\nindustry verticals that is proven to eliminate 99.99+% of all major pathogens, virus, mold, volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) and allergy triggers. As the Company’s\ninvestment in RCS does not have a readily determinable fair value, the Company previously elected to account for its 14% interest in RCS at cost, less impairment. The\nCompany recognized a loss on the investment of $97,488 during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024.\nThe acquired business did not contribute revenues or earnings to the Company for the period from August 16, 2024 to September 30, 2024. The following unaudited pro forma\nsummary presents consolidated information of the Company as if the business combination had occurred on January 1, 2023.\nPro forma\nnine months ended Pro forma year ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nRevenue 41,315 262,991\nNet loss 13,407,164 11,740,635\nThe Company did not have any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and\nnet loss position.\nThese pro forma amounts have been calculated after applying the Company’s accounting policies and adjusting the results of RCS to reflect the additional amortization that\nwould have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to the intangible assets had been applied from August 1, 2024, with the consequential tax effects.\nThe following table summarizes the consideration transferred to acquire RCS and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.\nNote payable forgiven 202,093\nConvertible debentures repaid on behalf of RCS 153,986\nCommon shares 295,000\nContingent consideration 79,000\nPreviously invested equity 118,850\nPurchase price $ 848,929\n13\nAugust 16, 2024\nPurchase price 848,929\nAssets acquired\nIn-process research and development 300,000\nTrademark 10,000\nBrand logo 10,000\nWeb domain 10,000\nCustomer list 138,000\nDevice firmware and software 50,000\nBlueprints 20,000\nFair value of identified net assets acquired 538,000\nGoodwill acquired on acquisition $ 310,929\nThe acquisition of RCS includes a contingent consideration arrangement that requires additional consideration to be paid by AgriFORCE to a previous owner of RCS who now\nserves as a Consultant to AgriFORCE (the “Consultant”). The Consultant is entitled to receive commissions on sales and production of RCS Units, which are payable in cash\nupon receipt of revenue or completed inventory by the Company. The consultant is also entitled to other manufacturing, sales and product development milestones, which are\noutlined below.\n(a) Completion of wall mount design\n(b) Completion of patent prosecution for any of the patent applications heretofore provided to Company or any new U.S. patent applications\n(c) Execute distribution agreements for other countries or verticals\n(d) Production of 250 RCS units\n(e) Production of 500 RCS units\n(f) Production of 1,000 RCS units\nThe Consultant is entitled to be awarded 25,000 restricted common shares of the Company for meeting each milestone.\nThe Consultant is also entitled to restricted stock units (“RSUs”) provided certain conditions are met.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no changes in the recognized amounts or range of outcomes for the contingent consideration recognized as a result of the acquisition of\nRCS.\nThe goodwill is attributable to the acquisition of the RCS technologies, synergies, access to their key vendors, and other non-quantifiable assets which are expected to create\ngrowth and diversification opportunities for the Company.\nPrior to the acquisition, the Company had a preexisting relationship with RCS. The Company was a 14% investor of RCS and held a receivable of $200,000 for a secured loan\nnote issued to RCS. As part of the acquisition terms, the receivable amount of $200,000 funded the purchase price consideration and was deemed settled.\n14\n4.

INVENTORIES\nAs at September 30, 2024, the Company had $47,174 in work-in-progress inventory (December 31, 2023 – $38,857 in finished goods).\n6. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nIntangible assets include $7,832,200 (December 31, 2023 - $12,733,885) for intellectual property (“Manna IP”) acquired under an asset purchase agreement with Manna\nNutritional Group, LLC (“Manna”) dated September 10, 2021. The Manna IP encompasses patented technologies to naturally process and convert grains, pulses, and root\nvegetables, into low-starch, low-sugar, high-protein, fiber-rich baking flour products, as well as a wide range of breakfast cereals, juices, natural sweeteners, and baking\nenhancers. The Company paid $1,475,000 in cash and issued 147,600 prefunded warrants valued at $12,106,677 (the “Purchase Price”). Subject to a 9.99% blocker and SEC\nRule 144 restrictions, the prefunded warrants vested in tranches up until March 10, 2024, at which time all tranches were fully vested. When vested the tranches of prefunded\nwarrants became convertible into an equal number of common shares.\nOn January 3, 2023, Manna satisfied all of its contractual obligations when the patent was approved by the US Patent and Trademark Office and the title was transferred to the\nCompany. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued 141,175 shares in relation to this transaction. As at September 30, 2024 all prefunded warrants had\nbeen converted (December 31, 2023 - 6,425 unconverted prefunded warrants).\nBased on the terms above and in conformity with US GAAP, the Company accounted for purchase as an asset acquisition. The asset was available for use on January 3, 2023.\nThe asset has a useful life of 20 years. The Company recorded $488,752 in amortization expense related to the Manna IP for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\n(September 30, 2023 - $492,220).\n15\nAs at September 30, 2024, the Company determined that there was an indicator of impairment for the intangible assets due to the significant decline in the Company’s stock\nprice as at September 30, 2024. As a result, the Company performed an interim intangible impairment test and determined that the fair value of the intangible asset was\n$7,832,200 based on an income approach using the Company’s estimated discounted cashflows. For valuing the Manna IP, the Company used the following assumption:\ndiscount rate 28%. The Company recorded an asset impairment loss of $4,137,271 in operating expenses.\nThe Company acquired intangible assets from RCS as part of the business combination (Note 3). The following intangible assets were acquired from RCS:\nWeighted Average Useful\nLife (Years)\nIn-process research and development Term of the patent 300,000\nTrademark 10 10,000\nBrand logo 10 10,000\nWeb domain 5 10,000\nCustomer list 5 138,000\nDevice firmware and software 5 50,000\nRCS blueprints 5 20,000\n$ 538,000\nThe estimated annual amortization expense for the next five years are as follows:\nPeriod ending: Amount\nRemaining 2024 $ 159,312\n2025 656,174\n2026 656,174\n2027 656,174\n2028 656,174\n2029 639,643\nThereafter 4,946,772\nTotal $ 8,370,423\n7. INVESTMENT\nOn June 18, 2023, the Company signed a memorandum of understanding with Radical Clean Solutions Ltd. (“RCS”) to purchase common shares issued by RCS. The Company\npaid RCS $225,000 for 14% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company. Under the terms of the MOU, the use of proceeds is exclusively for the advance\npurchase of hydroxyls generating devices for commercial sales into controlled environment agriculture, food manufacturing, warehousing and transportation verticals. The\nCompany was to receive one of five board of director seats of RCS and had a right of first refusal to maintain an ownership percentage in RCS of not less than 10% of the total\nissued and outstanding common shares. On October 1, 2023 the Company and RCS signed a definitive agreement to convert the advance into a 14% ownership investment in\nRCS.\nOn August 16, 2024, the Company acquired the assets of RCS as part of a business combination. The investment in RCS was accounted for as part of the step-acquisition\naccounting (Note 3). As at September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the investment in RCS was $nil (December 31, 2023 - $223,801).\n16\n8.

DEBENTURES\nOn June 30, 2022, the Company executed the definitive agreements (the “Purchase Agreements”) with arm’s length accredited institutional investors (the “Investors”) for\n$14,025,000 in debentures with a 10% original issue discount for gross proceeds of $12,750,000 (“First Tranche Debentures”). The First Tranche Debentures were convertible\ninto common shares at $111.00 per share. In addition, the Investors received 82,129 warrants at a strike price of $122.10, which expire on December 31, 2025 (the “First\nTranche Warrants”). The First Tranche Warrants and First Tranche Debentures each have down round provisions whereby the conversion and strike prices will be adjusted\ndownward if the Company issues equity instruments at lower prices. The First Tranche Warrants strike price and the First Tranche Debenture conversion price will be adjusted\ndown to the effective conversion price of the issued equity instruments. The transaction costs incurred in relation to first tranche were $1,634,894. The Debentures are senior to\nall other indebtedness or claims in right of payment, other than indebtedness secured by purchase money security interested.\nThe Investors had the right to purchase additional tranches of $5,000,000 each, up to a total additional principal amount of $33,000,000.\nOn January 17, 2023, the Investors purchased additional debentures totaling $5,076,923 with a 10% original issue discount for gross proceeds of $4,615,385 (the “Second\nTranche Debenture”).

The issuance of the additional tranche triggered the down round provision,\nadjusting the exercise prices of the First Tranche Debentures and the First Tranche Warrants to $62.00. The transaction costs incurred in relation to second tranche were\n$325,962.\nOn June 26, 2023, the Company entered into waiver and amendment agreements (“Debenture Modification Agreements”) with the Investors to modify terms of the Purchase\nAgreements.

The Conversion Price has been reduced to the lower of $22.50 or the price of subsequent dilutive issuances under the Company’s ATM program.\n3. 100% of ATM proceeds up to $1 million USD may be kept by Company, while any dollar amount over this threshold will be distributed 33% to the Company and 67%\nto the Investors.\n4. The minimum tranche value for Additional Closings has been reduced from $5.0 million to $2.5 million.\n5. The Investors have each agreed to raise no objection to one or more private placements of securities by the Company with an aggregate purchase price of up to\n$1,000,000 at a purchase price of at least $12.50 per common share and two-year warrant (with a per share exercise price of $25.00, and no registration rights).\n6. The Company may not prepay any portion of the principal amount of this Debenture without the prior written consent of the Investor; However the Company must\napply the approved or percentage of approved gross proceeds from the sale of its Common Stock from an at-the-market offering to prepay this Debenture (pro-rated\namong all Debentures) and shall be permitted to prepay the Debentures notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Debenture or the Purchase Agreement.\n17\nOn August 9, 2023, the Company entered into another waiver and amendment agreement (“Agreement”) with the Investors with respect to a certain Senior Convertible\nDebenture (the “Debentures”) due July 17, 2025 issued by the Company to that Investor. The Agreement provides as follows:\n1. The Company wishes to make Monthly Redemptions in shares of the Company’s Common Stock in lieu of cash payments, until further written notice from the\nCompany to the Purchaser.\n2. The Purchaser is willing to accept such shares as payment of the Monthly Redemption Amount provided that the Equity Conditions are met; and will consider on a\ncase-by-case basis accepting payments in shares of Common Stock if the Equity Conditions are not met, at its sole discretion. The Company may inquire of the\nPurchaser at least five (5) Trading Days prior to a Monthly Redemption Date whether the Purchaser is willing to accept Shares without the Equity Conditions having\nbeen met. An email reply from the Purchaser shall be sufficient evidence of such monthly waiver.\n3. The Purchaser will accept the August 1, 2023 Monthly Redemption Amount in shares of Common Stock valued at the August 1 Repayment Price for such date.\nOn October 18, 2023, the Investors purchased additional debentures totaling $2,750,000 with a 10% original issue discount for gross proceeds of $2,500,000 (the “Third\nTranche Debenture”).

Mr. Mueller alleges to have suffered damages including, among other things, a loss of\nbase salary of $473,367 CAD per annum and damages from not receiving common stock of AgriFORCE equivalent in value to $468,313 CAD. AgriFORCE’s position is that\nMr. Mueller was terminated for ‘just cause’ because he breached his fiduciary duty to act in AgriFORCE’s best interest by, among other things, submitting a sizeable bid for the\nacquisition of a company without first obtaining Board approval. In doing so, Mr. Mueller misrepresented AgriFORCE’s financial standing and forged, or instructed others to\nforge, a document by affixing the electronic signature of AgriFORCE’s CFO.\nAs at December 31, 2023, the parties were in the discovery stage of litigation. AgriFORCE has produced relevant documents to Mr. Mueller, and is awaiting Mr. Mueller’s\nproduction of relevant documents. The parties are also in the process of scheduling examinations for discovery. Management is instructing counsel to advance the matter given\nthe relative strength of AgriFORCE’s case.\nThe likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is relatively low given the facts supporting AgriFORCE’s ‘for cause’ termination of Mr. Mueller as well as the significant expense\nthat Mr. Mueller would have to incur to advance this matter to trial.\nOn September 13, 2023, Stronghold filed a Complaint with the Superior Court of California for Breach of Contract; Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing;\nand Common Count: Goods and Services Rendered in relation to the purchase and sale agreement for the Coachella property.

Stronghold is claiming $451,684 plus interest in damages based on invoices it provided. AgriFORCE will dispute,\namong other things, the amount and invoices, estimating approximately $230,000 as Stronghold’s true expenses that may be claimed. The Company filed their answer on\nFebruary 26, 2024. The parties have agreed to go into mediation.\nOn March 27, 2024, BV Peeters Advocaten-Avocats (“Peeters”) summoned the Company to appear on May 31, 2024 at the First Chamber of the Dutch-Speaking Division of\nthe Business Court in Brussels. Peeters is seeking payment for €467,249 of unpaid bills for legal services plus penalties and interest.

The Company does not intend to pay the outstanding legal bills and intends to vigorously defend its position in\ncourt. The parties have agreed to go into mediation.\nOn July 11, 2024, AgriFORCE’s former General Counsel filed a Notice of Civil Claim with the Supreme Court of British Columbia, in which he alleges that AgriFORCE\nwrongfully terminated his employment without notice, in breach of the parties’ underlying employment agreement. Former General Counsel alleges to have suffered damages\nincluding, among other things, a loss of base salary of $250,000 CAD per annum, damages from not receiving common stock of AgriFORCE equivalent in value to $62,500\nCAD, and damages from not receiving entitlement to the Company’s short-term incentive bonus of $90,563 CAD and participation in the Company’s long-term incentive stock\noption program, and participation in the Company’s Group Benefits plan. The Company filed a response to the claim on August 2, 2024. AgriFORCE’s position is that General\nCounsel was terminated for ‘just cause’. The likelihood of an unfavorable outcome cannot be determined at this time but the Company will vigorously defend its position in\ncourt.\n17.

The Company’s registered and records office address is at 800 – 525 West 8th Avenue, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V5Z 1C6.\nOur Business\nAgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. (“AgriFORCE™” or the “Company”) was incorporated as a private company by Articles of Incorporation issued pursuant to the provisions\nof the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on December 22, 2017. The Company’s registered and records office address is at 800 – 525 West 8th Avenue, Vancouver,\nBritish Columbia, Canada, V5Z 1C6.\nThe Company is an innovative sustainable technology focused company that strives to innovate and deliver sustainable technology solutions across a wide array of verticals\nutilization of our proprietary intellectual property to businesses and enterprises through our AgriFORCE™ Solutions division (“Solutions”) and deliver innovative flour\nproducts through our AgriFORCE™ Brands division (“Brands”). To this end, we announce the next phase of our transition, highlighted by the intended integration of Bitcoin\nmining solutions and the ancillary environmental and power-generation benefits that result from engaging in that business. We recognize the potential of Bitcoin and other\ndigital currencies in facilitating sustainable financial transactions and intend to utilize 10-20% of our future capital raised to purchase and hold Bitcoin. In the third quarter of\n2024, the Company bought the assets of the Radical Clean Solutions (“RCS”) business for which it had bought an exclusive license to the agricultural industry in 2023. During\n2023, the Company launched its UN(THINK) Awakened Flour™, which is a nutritious flour that we believe provides health advantages over traditional flour.\nWhile Solutions’ legacy focus was to operate in the plant based pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and other high value crop markets using its unique proprietary facility design and\nhydroponics based automated growing system that enable cultivators to effectively grow crops in a controlled environment (“FORCEGH+™”). it has changed its focus to\nbroaden the use of its proprietary intellectual property across multiple industries. For instance, the Company through its RCS purchase is not able to utilize that technology to\ndeliver solutions across multiple industries, including not only agriculture, but other industries including hospitality, commercial applications, education institutions, residential\nreal estate and transportation.\nBrands is focused on the development and commercialization of plant-based ingredients and products that deliver healthier and more nutritious solutions. We strive to market\nand commercialize both branded consumer product offerings and ingredient supply.\nAgriFORCE™ Brands\nUN(THINK)™ Foods\nThe Company purchased Intellectual Property (“IP”) from Manna Nutritional Group, LLC (“Manna”), a privately held firm based in Boise, Idaho on September 10, 2021. The\nIP encompasses a granted patent to naturally process and convert grain, pulses and root vegetables, resulting in low-starch, low-sugar, high-protein, fiber-rich baking flour as\nwell as produces a natural sweetener juice. The core process is covered under Patent Nr. 11,540,538 in the U.S. and key international markets. The all-natural process is\ndesigned to unlock nutritional properties, flavors, and other qualities in a range of modern, ancient and heritage grains, pulses and root vegetables to create specialized all-\nnatural baking and all-purpose flours, sweeteners, juices, naturally sweet cereals and other valuation products, providing numerous opportunities for dietary nutritional,\nperformance and culinary applications.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has achieved milestones towards the commercialization of our UN(THINK) Awakened Flour™ flour, the Company’s\nfirst line of products to utilize the IP. Management has defined and tested its quality controls and safety protocols for production, and produced several multi-ton batches of\ngerminated grains, refining and scaling production processes with our partners in Canada. We are also in the process of qualifying partners in the US to establish additional\nproduction hubs – at no additional CAPEX - which will support growth and reduce logistics costs for customers in the region. Additionally, we have established our supply\nchain logistics with a contracted shipping company and two warehouses in Canada and the US. Our commercial team made progress in defining pricing and is starting to\napproach US and Canadian Bakeries and Baked Goods Companies who are now testing our new flours for integration into their manufacturing operations and innovation\npipeline. Online sales logistics and advertising materials were developed during the period to support the establishment of the direct-to-consumer sales channel which will be\nstarted once the Business to Business channel sales will ramp up. Lastly, the Company has developed an extensive number of recipes for the application of Awakened Flour™\nproduct line for both customers and consumers.\n24\nWheat and Flour Market\nModern diet is believed to be a contributor to health risks such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity, due in part to the consumption of highly processed foods that are\nlow in natural fiber, protein and nutrition; and extremely high in simple starch, sugar and calories. These “empty carbs” produce glycemic swings that may cause overeating by\ntriggering cravings for food high in sugar, salt and starch. As an example, conventional baking flour is low in natural fiber (~ 2-3%), low-to-average in protein (~ 9%), and very\nhigh in starch (~ 75%)(1). Apart from dietary fiber, whole flour is only marginally better in terms of these macronutrients (2).\nIn contrast, foods high in fiber help to satiate hunger, suppress cravings and raise metabolism(3). They also assist in weight loss, lower cholesterol, and may reduce the risk of\ncancer, heart disease and diabetes(4).\nAdvantages of the UN(THINK)™ Foods IP\nOur Controlled Enzymatic Reaction & Endothermic Saccharification with Managed Natural Germination (“CERES-MNG”) patented process allows for the development and\nmanufacturing of all-natural flours that are significantly higher in fibers, nutrients and proteins and significantly lower in carbohydrates and calories than standard baking flour.\nCERES-MNG baking flour produced from soft white wheat has 40 times more fiber, three (3) times more protein and 75% less net carbohydrates than regular all- purpose\nflour(5).\nSource: Independent analysis by Eurofins Food Chemistry Testing Madison, Inc, February 2022\nThe CERES-MNG patent will help develop new flours and products from modern, ancient and heritage grains, seeds, legumes and tubers/root vegetables.\nProducts that AgriFORCE™ intends to develop for commercialization from the CERES-MNG patented process under the UN(THINK)™ foods brand:\n- High protein, high fiber, low carb modern, heritage and ancient grain flours (for use in breads, baked goods, doughs, pastry, snacks, and pasta)\n- Protein flours and protein additives\n- High protein, high fiber, low carb cereals and snacks\n- High protein, high fiber, low carb oat based dairy alternatives\n- Better tasting, cleaner label, high protein, high fiber, low carb nutrition bars\n- High protein, high fiber, low carb nutrition juices\n- Sweeteners – liquid and granulated\n- High protein, high fiber, low carb pet foods and snacks\n(1) Based on protein, fiber, and starch content results from a nationally certified independent laboratory, as compared to standard all-purpose flour.\n(2) https://www.soupersage.com/compare-nutrition/flour-vs-whole-wheat-flour\n(3) https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/14400-improving-your-health-with-fiber\n(4) https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fiber-full-eating-for-better-health-and-lower-cholesterol-2019062416819\n(5) Based on protein, fiber, and starch content results from a nationally certified independent laboratory, as compared to standard all-purpose flour.\n25\nWe intend to commercialize these products behind two (2) main sales channels:\n- Branded ingredients (B2B)\n- Consumer branded products (B2B and B2C)\nTo produce the UN(THINK)™ power wheat flour, we are using our patented process to develop a new germinated whole grain wheat flour, which we have qualified and made\navailable for sale through November 2023 in Canada and the USA, under the UN(THINK)™ Awakened Flour™ brand. This new Awakened Grains™ flour – available in 3\ntypes: hard white wheat and hard red wheat for breads and soft white wheat for bakery and pastries – will provide enhanced nutrition with over five times more fiber, up to two\ntimes more protein and 23% less net carbs versus conventional all-purpose flour (source: Eurofins Food Chemistry Madison, Inc, December 2022).\nGROWTH PLAN\nAgriFORCE™’s organic growth plan is to actively establish and deploy the commercialization of products in four distinct phases:\nPHASE 1 (COMPLETED):\n● Product and process testing and validation.

We are taking modern technologies such as artificial intelligence (“AI”) and\nblockchain–based advances to bring what is traditionally a low technology industry into the 21st century. This approach means that we are able to reach into areas not readily\navailable to agricultural businesses in the past, such as advanced Fintech to enhance financing capabilities for these businesses and more readily provide advanced intelligence\nfor farmers. These technologies can also be applied to worldwide sourcing and matching food producers to consumers in an efficient manner.\nOur intellectual property combines a patented uniquely engineered facility design and automated growing system to solve excessive water loss and high energy consumption,\ntwo problems plaguing nearly all controlled environment agriculture systems. FORCEGH+ delivers a patented clean, sealed, self-contained micro-environment that maximizes\nnatural sunlight and offers supplemental LED lighting. It limits human intervention and is designed to provide superior quality control through AI optical technology. It was\nalso created to drastically reduce environmental impact, substantially decrease utility demands, conserving water, while delivering customers daily harvests and higher crop\nyields.\nThe Ag-Tech sector is severely underserved by the capital markets, and we see an opportunity to acquire global companies who have provided solutions to the industry and are\nleading innovation moving forward. The robustness of our engagement with potential targets has confirmed our belief and desire to be part of a larger integrated Ag-Tech\nsolutions provider, where each separate element of the business has its existing legacy business and can leverage across areas of expertise to expand their business footprint.\nBUSINESS PLAN\nThe Company will launch a full line up of Hydroxyl Devices and start commercializing the Hydroxyl Devises into the US market of CEA and Food Manufacturing.

Effective as of\nthe same day, Jolie Kahn was appointed Executive Turnaround Consultant to support the Company’s operational growth and expansion efforts. On June 4, 2024, the Board\nDirectors appointed Jolie Kahn as Chief Executive Officer. Jolie Kahn shall report to David Welch, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, who shall act as\nExecutive Chairman until such time as a permanent Chief Executive Officer is appointed.\nOn February 19, 2024, Margaret Honey resigned as a Director of (the “Company”) to pursue other interests. The resignation is not the result of any disagreement with the\nCompany.\nOn June 4, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Jolie Kahn as Chief Executive Officer. Previously, on February 10, 2024, Jolie Kahn was appointed\nExecutive Turnaround Consultant to support the Company’s operational growth and expansion efforts. Jolie Kahn will continue to support these efforts and to report to the\nBoard of Directors of the Company.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn June 17, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”) under which the Company may repurchase up to $1\nmillion of its outstanding common shares, for a period of six months, subject to contractual requirements. The Board will periodically review the Company’s Repurchase\nProgram and may decide to extend its term or increase the authorized amount.\nRCS Acquisition\nWe purchased all of the assets of RCS in August 2024. A discussion of the acquisition is set forth above in footnote 3 to our financial statements included herein.\nStatus as an Emerging Growth Company\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company”\ncan take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or\nrevised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise\napply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards\non the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for private companies.\n29\nWe are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set\nforth in the JOBS Act, as an “emerging growth company,” we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions from, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor’s attestation report\non our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted\nby the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information\nabout the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (a) the last day of\nour fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the initial public offering, (b) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07\nbillion, (c) the last day of our fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or\nExchange Act (which would occur if the market value of our equity securities that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently\ncompleted second fiscal quarter), or (d) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\nFOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed unaudited financial statements for the interim periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included\nin this report.\nRevenues\nThe Company sells its products directly to customers and indirectly to customers through sales brokers.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold and delivered 8 hydroxyl generating devices for gross sales of $41,315. There were no such\nsales in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses primarily consist of wages and salaries, professional fees, consulting, office and administration, investor and public relations, research and development,\nand share-based compensation.\nOperating expenses increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 by $3,974,421 or 244% primarily due to the following:\n● Intangible asset impairment increased by $4,137,271 due impairment of the Company’s Manna patent due to the fair value of the asset exceeding the carrying value of the\nintangible asset, requiring a write-down of the asset. There was no such impairment in 2023.\n● Consulting increased by $30,025, due to additional consultants hired during the quarter to assist with sales, product manufacturing, and M&A.\n● Office and administrative expenses increased by $93,357 due to the increase in miscellaneous spend for business development and other related expenditures\n● Research and development increased by $81,082 due to product development expenses for RCS that occurred after the acquisition on August 16, 2024, no such expenses\nduring 2023.\n● Travel and entertainment increased by $19,944 increased international travel for foreign business development.\n● Professional fees decreased by $165,333 due to reduced legal fees that were required for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for M&A activity but none for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.\n● Wages and salaries decreased by $116,721 due to a reduction in staff head count (number of employees reduced from 15 during the three months ended September 30,\n2023 to 6 during the three months ended September 30, 2024).\n● Share based compensation decreased by $16,985 due to a significant number of option forfeitures from lower staff head count.\n● Lease expense decreased $72,479 due to shifting from a short term office lease to a virtual office.\n● All other items aggregate to $15,740\nOther Expenses / (Income)\nOther expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased due to the following:\n● Change in fair value of derivative liabilities increased by $179,586 due to the Company’s stock price decreasing during the period between June 30, 2024 and September\n30, 2024, resulting in the decreased fair value of the Company’s derivative liabilities and increased gains on the change in fair value.\n● Increase in gain on debt extinguishment increased by $75,119 as a result of unscheduled conversions of debentures into the Company’s common shares which triggered\nextinguishments of debt due to the change of the fair value of the debt after the conversions. There were no debt extinguishments during the three months ended September\n30, 2024.\n● Increase in loss on long-term investment decreased by $97,488 due to the requirement to the revaluation of the existing investment in RCS prior to the step acquisition. No\nsuch loss during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n● Loss on conversion of convertible debt increased by $127,251 due to a significant amount of unscheduled conversions that were issued at a higher premium above the\nexercise price compared to shares issued during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThis was partially offset by the following:\n● Accretion interest on debentures decreased by $1,595,252 due to a significant amount of debentures being converted to shares during 2024, resulting in less interest\naccreted during the three months ended June 30, 2024.\n● All other items aggregate to $5,109.\n30\nOperating expenses increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023 by $722,802 or 10% primarily due to the following:\n● Intangible asset impairment increased by $4,137,271 due to the impairment of the Company’s Manna patent due to the fair value of the asset exceeding the carrying value\nof the intangible asset, requiring a write-down of the asset. There was no such impairment in 2023.\n● Wages and salaries decreased by $1,113,285 due to a reduction in staff head count (number of employees reduced from 15 during the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 to 6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024).\n● Consulting and professional fees decreased by $668,799 and $583,954, respectively due to a significant decrease in M&A spending during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as a result of the Company focusing on organic growth of currently active ventures.\n● Share based compensation decreased $438,187 due to a significant number of option forfeitures from lower staff head count.\n● Investor and public relations expenses decreased by $346,724 due to more investor and public relations advisory services utilized in 2023 for Company campaigns and\ncommunication to investors.\n● Travel and entertainment decreased by $73,023 due to a reduction in travel for foreign business development.\n● Lease expense decreased $163,177 due to the termination of the Company’s long term office lease in 2023.\n● Sales and marketing decreased by $77,461 due to significant reductions in public relations agency work and social media contracted fees from cost cutting initiatives.\n● Travel and entertainment decrease by $73,023 due to an increase in international travel for business development\n● Office and administrative increased by $43,622 due to an increase in miscellaneous expenses that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. overall cost\ncutting initiatives for the six months ended June 30, 2024.\n● Research and development increased by $35,818 due to product development expenses for RCS that occurred after the acquisition on August 16, 2024, no such expenses\nduring 2023.\n● All other items aggregate to $29,302\nOther expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased due to the following:\n● Change in fair value of derivative liabilities decreased by $4,960,513 due to (1) the draw down as well as the extinguishment of conversion feature derivatives as a result of\nsignificant conversions of several tranches of debentures, and (2) the Company’s stock price stabilizing during the period between December 31, 2023 and September 30,\n2024, resulting in the smaller revaluation adjustment as at September 30, 2024.\n● Increase in loss on debt extinguishment by $2,223,250 as a result of unscheduled conversions of debentures into the Company’s common shares which triggered\nextinguishments of debt due to the change of the fair value of the debt after the conversions. There were no debt extinguishments during the nine months ended September\n30, 2024.\n● Increase in loss on conversion of convertible debt by $1,086,128 due to a significant amount of unscheduled conversions that resulted in shares issued at a higher premium\nabove the exercise price compared to shares issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n● Increase in loss on long-term investment decreased by $97,488 due to the requirement to the revaluation of the existing investment in RCS prior to the step acquisition. No\nsuch loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThis was partially offset by the following:\n● Accretion interest on debentures decreased by $3,372,449 due to a significant amount of debentures being converted to shares during 2024, resulting in less interest\naccreted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n● Foreign exchange gain increased by $21,601 due to increasing USD to CAD rate throughout the six months ended June 30, 2024.\n● All other items aggregate to $21,922.\n31\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company’s primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes. The Company’s ability to fund\noperations and make planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations depends on future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing\neconomic conditions, financial markets, business and other factors. We have recorded a net loss of $13,407,164 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and a net loss of\n$7,740,078 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We have recorded an accumulated deficit of $57,914,468 as of September 30, 2024 and $44,507,304 as of\nDecember 31, 2023. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $3,429,189 and $5,437,592 respectively.\nThe Company held $1,373,294 in cash as at September 30, 2024 as compared to $3,878,578 at December 31, 2023.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n● the cost and timing of our regulatory activities, especially the process to obtain regulatory approval for our intellectual properties in the U.S. and in foreign countries\n● the costs of R&D activities we undertake to further develop our technology\n● the costs of constructing our grow houses, including any impact of complications, delays, and other unknown events\n● the costs of commercialization activities, including sales, marketing and production\n● the level of working capital required to support our growth\n● our need for additional personnel, information technology or other operating infrastructure to support our growth and operations as a public company\n● completion of planned acquisitions\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal\ncourse of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and\nclassification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company is at the stage of development of its first facility and other IP. As such it is likely\nthat additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to develop and commercialize its technology. These factors raise substantial doubt about the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nFor the next twelve months from issuance of these financial statements, the Company will seek to obtain additional capital through the sale of debt or equity financings or other\narrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of\nadditional equity may dilute existing shareholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to currently outstanding common shares. Issued\ndebt securities may contain covenants and limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders. If the Company is unable to obtain such\nadditional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. Due to the uncertainty in the Company’s ability to raise capital, management believes that\nthere is substantial doubt in the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements.\nCash Flows\nThe net cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $3,429,189 compared to $5,437,592 for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The decrease of $2,008,403 was primarily due to the following:\n● Increase in impairment of intangible asset of $4,137 271 due to assessment noted above.\n● Increase in loss on long-term investment of $97,488 due to assessment noted above.\n● Decrease in cash flow adjustments of $188,463 for share based compensation due to forfeiture of stock options by departed employees.\n● Decrease of $3,254,034 in amortization of debt issuance costs for less interest recorded on debentures as the carrying value of the debentures were lower as at September\n30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023.\n● Increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets used in operating activities of $571,119 due to utilization of consulting retainers and as well as additional\nprepayments made during September 30, 2024 for various services.\n● Decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $701,115 due to the Company paying down its higher aged trade payables balance during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n32\nThis was partially offset by the following:\n● Increase in net loss of $5,667,086 due to operating expenses noted above.\n● Non-cash change in fair value of derivative liabilities decreased by $4,960,5139 due to (1) the draw down as well as the extinguishment of conversion feature derivatives\nas a result of significant conversions of several tranches of debentures, and (2) the Company’s stock price stabilizing during the period between December 31, 2023 and\nSeptember 30, 2024, resulting in the smaller revaluation adjustment as at September 30, 2024.\n● Increase in loss on debt extinguishment cash adjustment by $2,223,250 as a result of unscheduled conversions of debentures into the Company’s common shares which\ntriggered extinguishments of debt due to the change of the fair value of the debt after the conversions. There were no debt extinguishments during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n● Increase in loss on conversion of convertible debt cash adjustment by $1,086,128 due to a significant amount of unscheduled conversions that resulted in shares issued at a\nhigher premium above the exercise price compared to shares issued during the six months ended September 30, 2023.\n● All other items aggregate to $114,429.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $356,079 for cash consideration paid for the RCS acquisition.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, represents net proceeds from debentures of $2,250,000. This was partially offset by\nrepayments on convertible debentures of $802,282 and financing costs of debentures of $84,463. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, represents net proceeds from debentures of $4,615,385 as well as common shares issued for cash of $1,342,915. This was partially offset by repayments\non convertible debentures of $1,741,950, financing costs of debentures of $325,962 and share issuance costs of $153,220.\nRecent Financings\nOn January 17, 2023, the Debenture Investors purchased additional tranches totaling $5,076,923 and received 53,226 warrants. The convertible debentures and debenture\nwarrants were issued with an exercise price of $62.00 and expire on July 17, 2025. The issuance of the additional tranches triggered the down round provision, adjusting the\nexercise prices of the First Tranche Debentures and the First Tranche Debenture Warrants to $62.00.\nOn June 20, 2023 the Company issued 20,000 common shares with 20,000 warrants through a private placement for consideration of $250,000.\nBetween June 7, 2023 and August 30, 2023, the Company issued 124,652 common shares for cash under the ATM public offerings agreement for net proceeds of $939,695. The\nissuance triggered the down round provision, adjusting the exercise prices of the First and Second Tranche Debentures as well as the First and Second Tranche Debenture\nWarrants to $5.50.\nOn October 18, 2023, a Debenture Investor purchased an additional tranche totaling $2,750,000 in convertible debentures and received 620,230 warrants. The convertible\ndebentures and debenture warrants were issued with an exercise price of $2.62 and expire on April 18, 2027. The issuance of the additional tranche further triggered the down\nround provision, adjusting the exercise prices of the First and Second Tranche Debentures as well as the First and Second Tranche Debenture Warrants to $2.62.\nOn November 30, 2023, a Debenture Investor purchased an additional tranche totaling $2,750,000 in convertible debentures and received 1,986,112 warrants. The convertible\ndebentures and debenture warrants were issued with an exercise price of $0.90 and expire on May 30, 2027.

Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act. Our management is also required to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management assessed the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework in the 2013 COSO framework. Based on this assessment, management\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nChanges in Internal Controls.\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.\nOur management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute\nassurance that its objectives will be met. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that\nmanagement is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Similarly, an evaluation of controls cannot\nprovide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\n34\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

These forward-looking statements represent our expectations, beliefs, intentions or\nstrategies concerning future events, including, but not limited to, any statements regarding our assumptions about financial performance; the continuation of historical trends;\nthe sufficiency of our cash balances for future liquidity and capital resource needs; the expected impact of changes in accounting policies on our results of operations, financial\ncondition or cash flows; anticipated problems and our plans for future operations; and the economy in general or the future of the defense industry, all of which were subject to\nvarious risks and uncertainties.\nWhen used in this Report on Form 10- K and other reports, statements, and information we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission” or\n“SEC”), in our press releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, in oral statements made by or with the approval of an executive officer, the words or phrases\n“believes,” “may,” “will,” “expects,” “should,” “continue,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “will likely result,” “estimates,” “projects” or similar expressions and variations thereof are\nintended to identify such forward-looking statements. However, any statements contained in this Report on Form 10-K that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed\nto be forward-looking statements. We caution that these statements by their nature involve risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond our control, and actual results\nmay differ materially depending on a variety of important factors.\nWe do not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. You should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors described in this annual report. In\nthis Form 10-K, AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. (“AgriFORCE™” or the “Company”) has identified important factors that could cause actual results to differ from\nexpected or historic results. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a\ncomplete list of all potential risks or uncertainties.\n3\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nOverview\nAgriFORCE™ was incorporated as a private company by Articles of Incorporation issued pursuant to the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on\nDecember 22, 2017. The Company’s registered and records office address is at 800 – 525 West 8th Avenue, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V5Z 1C6.\nOur Business\nAgriFORCE™ is an “Ag-Tech” company with a primary focus to developing and utilizing our intellectual property assets for improvements dedicated to the agricultural\nindustry. We believe that this goal is best achieved by using our proprietary IP for solutions in the agricultural industry as well as seeking development of new IP to both\nenhance the technology which we already retain in house as well as development of new technologies which can increase our footprint in the Ag-Tech space with expansion\ninto other areas which have ESG ramifications.\nOur AgriFORCE™ Brands division is focused on the development and commercialization of plant-based ingredients and products that deliver more nutritious food. We will\nmarket and commercialize ingredient supplies, like our Awakened Flour™ and Awakened Grains ™.\nThe AgriFORCE™ Solutions division is dedicated to transforming modern agriculture through our controlled environment agriculture (“CEA”) equipment, including our\nFORCEGH+™” solution. We are continuing to modify our business plan to accommodate artificial intelligence and blockchain in the development and implementation of\nFinTech systems to commercial farmers, and advancing on the commercialization of our Hydroxyl clean room systems to greatly reduce the spread of pathogens, mold and\ndisease at processing facilities worldwide.\nAgriFORCE™ Brands\nUN(THINK)™ Foods\nThe Company purchased Intellectual Property (“IP”) from Manna Nutritional Group, LLC (“Manna”), a privately held firm based in Boise, Idaho on September 10, 2021. The\nIP encompasses a granted patent to naturally process and convert grain, pulses and root vegetables, resulting in low-starch, low-sugar, high-protein, fiber-rich baking flour as\nwell as produces a natural sweetener juice. The core process is covered under Patent Nr. 11,540,538 in the U.S. and key international markets. The all-natural process is\ndesigned to unlock nutritional properties, flavors, and other qualities in a range of modern, ancient and heritage grains, pulses and root vegetables to create specialized all-\nnatural baking and all-purpose flours, sweeteners, juices, naturally sweet cereals and other valuation products, providing numerous opportunities for dietary nutritional,\nperformance and culinary applications.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has achieved milestones towards the commercialization of our UN(THINK) Awakened Flour™ flour, the Company’s\nfirst line of products to utilize the IP. Management has defined and tested its quality controls and safety protocols for production, and produced several multi-ton batches of\ngerminated grains, refining and scaling production processes with our partners in Canada. We are also in the process of qualifying partners in the US to establish additional\nproduction hubs – at no additional CAPEX - which will support growth and reduce logistics costs for customers in the region. Additionally, we have established our supply\nchain logistics with a contracted shipping company and two warehouses in Canada and the US. Our commercial team made progress in defining pricing and is starting to\napproach US and Canadian Bakeries and Baked Goods Companies who are now testing our new flours for integration into their manufacturing operations and innovation\npipeline. Online sales logistics and advertising materials were developed during the period to support the establishment of the direct-to-consumer sales channel which will be\nstarted once the Business to Business channel sales will ramp up. Lastly, the Company has developed an extensive number of recipes for the application of Awakened Flour™\nproduct line for both customers and consumers.\nThe Company is developing several finished product prototypes including a line of pancake mixes, which are ready for consumer testing.\nWheat and Flour Market\nModern diet is believed to be a contributor to health risks such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity, due in part to the consumption of highly processed foods that are\nlow in natural fiber, protein and nutrition; and extremely high in simple starch, sugar and calories. These “empty carbs” produce glycemic swings that may cause overeating by\ntriggering cravings for food high in sugar, salt and starch. As an example, conventional baking flour is low in natural fiber (~ 2-3%), low-to-average in protein (~ 9%), and very\nhigh in starch (~ 75%)(4). Apart from dietary fiber, whole flour is only marginally better in terms of these macronutrients (5).\n(4) Based on protein, fiber, and starch content results from a nationally certified independent laboratory, as compared to standard all-purpose flour.\n(5) https://www.soupersage.com/compare-nutrition/flour-vs-whole-wheat-flour\n4\nIn contrast, foods high in fiber help to satiate hunger, suppress cravings and raise metabolism(6). They also assist in weight loss, lower cholesterol, and may reduce the risk of\ncancer, heart disease and diabetes(7).\nAdvantages of the UN(THINK)™ Foods IP\nOur Controlled Enzymatic Reaction & Endothermic Saccharification with Managed Natural Germination (“CERES-MNG”) patented process allows for the development and\nmanufacturing of all-natural flours that are significantly higher in fibers, nutrients and proteins and significantly lower in carbohydrates and calories than standard baking flour.\nCERES-MNG baking flour produced from soft white wheat has 40 times more fiber, three (3) times more protein and 75% less net carbohydrates than regular all- purpose\nflour(8).\nSource: Independent analysis by Eurofins Food Chemistry Testing Madison, Inc, February 2022\nThe CERES-MNG patent will help develop new flours and products from modern, ancient and heritage grains, seeds, legumes and tubers/root vegetables.\n(6) https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/14400-improving-your-health-with-fiber\n(7) https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fiber-full-eating-for-better-health-and-lower-cholesterol-2019062416819\n(8) Based on protein, fiber, and starch content results from a nationally certified independent laboratory, as compared to standard all-purpose flour.\n5\nProducts that AgriFORCE™ intends to develop for commercialization from the CERES-MNG patented process under the UN(THINK)™ foods brand:\n- High protein, high fiber, low carb modern, heritage and ancient grain flours (for use in breads, baked goods, doughs, pastry, snacks, and pasta)\n- Protein flours and protein additives\n- High protein, high fiber, low carb cereals and snacks\n- High protein, high fiber, low carb oat based dairy alternatives\n- Better tasting, cleaner label, high protein, high fiber, low carb nutrition bars\n- High protein, high fiber, low carb nutrition juices\n- Sweeteners – liquid and granulated\n- High protein, high fiber, low carb pet foods and snacks\nWe intend to commercialize these products behind three (2) main sales channels:\n- Branded ingredients (B2B)\n- Consumer branded products (B2B and B2C)\nSuccessful commercialization of premium specialized products from the UN(THINK)™ foods IP and the capture of a small percentage share of the category is a notable\nbusiness opportunity for AgriFORCE™.\nBreads & Whole Wheat Pulse Dairy Cereal\nBakery (2) Flours (1) Flours (3) Alternatives Bars (4) Total\nGlobal market size of target categories $ 235B $ 72B $ 19B $ 23B $ 23B\nPotential market share 0.1% 0.2% 1% 0.01% 0.01%\nAgriFORCE™ potential net revenues $ 200M $ 140M $ 190M $ 20M $ 20M $ 560M\nSources: Future Market Insights Reports, June 2022 (2), October 2022 (1), January 2023 (3) and October 2022 (4), .\n6\nTo produce the UN(THINK)™ power wheat flour, we are using our patented process to develop a new germinated whole grain wheat flour, which we have qualified and made\navailable for sale through November 2023 in Canada and the USA, under the UN(THINK)™ Awakened Flour™ brand.

We are taking modern technologies such as artificial intelligence (“AI”) and\nblockchain–based advances to bring what is traditionally a low technology industry into the 21st century. This approach means that we are able to reach into areas not readily\navailable to agricultural businesses in the past, such as advanced Fintech to enhance financing capabilities for these businesses and more readily provide advanced intelligence\nfor farmers. These technologies can also be applied to worldwide sourcing and matching food producers to consumers in an efficient manner.\nOur intellectual property combines a patented uniquely engineered facility design and automated growing system to solve excessive water loss and high energy consumption,\ntwo problems plaguing nearly all controlled environment agriculture systems. FORCEGH+ delivers a patented clean, sealed, self-contained micro-environment that maximizes\nnatural sunlight and offers supplemental LED lighting. It limits human intervention and is designed to provide superior quality control through AI optical technology. It was\nalso created to drastically reduce environmental impact, substantially decrease utility demands, conserving water, while delivering customers daily harvests and higher crop\nyields.\n7\nThe Ag-Tech sector is severely underserved by the capital markets, and we see an opportunity to acquire global companies who have provided solutions to the industry and are\nleading innovation moving forward. The robustness of our engagement with potential targets has confirmed our belief and desire to be part of a larger integrated Ag-Tech\nsolutions provider, where each separate element of the business has its existing legacy business and can leverage across areas of expertise to expand their business footprint.\nThe Company intends to continue development and license its technology to existing farmers in the plant based pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and high value crop markets\nusing its unique patented facility design and hydroponics based automated growing system that enable farmers to effectively grow crops in a sealed controlled environment\n(“FORCEGH+™”). The Company has designed FORCEGH+™ facilities to produce crops in virtually any environmental condition and to optimize crop yields to as near their\nfull genetic potential possible while substantially eliminating the need for the use of pesticides, fungicides and/or irradiation. The Company continues to develop its solution for\nfruits and vegetables focusing on the integration of its current structure with a new form of vertical grow technology.\nBUSINESS PLAN\nThe Company will launch a full line up of Hydroxyl Devices and start commercializing the Hydroxyl Devises into the US market of CEA and Food Manufacturing. The\nCompany will identify and establish exclusive distribution agreement for the EMEA region as well Expand Distribution Network into Latin America and Asia.

Effective as of\nthe same day, Jolie Kahn was appointed Executive Turnaround Consultant to support the Company’s operational growth and expansion efforts. Jolie Kahn shall report to David\nWelch, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, who shall act as Executive Chairman until such time as a permanent Chief Executive Officer is appointed.\nOn February 19, 2024, Margaret Honey resigned as a Director of (the “Company”) to pursue other interests. The resignation is not the result of any disagreement with the\nCompany.\n14\nEmployees\nAs of April 1, 2024, the Company has seven (7) employees and three (3) consultants /contractors. The Company also relies on consultants and contractors to conduct its\noperations. The Company anticipates that it will be hiring additional employees to support its planned activities.\nOperations\nThe Company primary operating activities are in Idaho, USA and Saskatoon, Canada. The Company’s head office is located in Vancouver, Canada.\nStatus as an Emerging Growth Company\nOn April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company”\ncan take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or\nrevised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise\napply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards\non the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for private companies.\nWe are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set\nforth in the JOBS Act, as an “emerging growth company,” we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions from, without limitation, (i) providing an auditor’s attestation report\non our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted\nby the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information\nabout the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (a) the last day of\nour fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of this offering, (b) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (c)\nthe last day of our fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act\n(which would occur if the market value of our equity securities that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed\nsecond fiscal quarter), or (d) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\n15\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to the Company’s Business\nThe Company is an early stage company with little operating history, a history of losses and the Company cannot assure profitability.\nThe Company currently has little revenues and does not have any significant history of revenue generating operations. The Company has been involved in the design and\ndevelopment of its CEA FORCEGH+™ facility, acquisition, the sales and development of Hydroxyl generating devices and advancement of the UN(THINK)™ foods IP,\nproduct base, and transacting with potential revenue generating acquirees. While the Company has invested considerably in these business plans, no FORCEGH+™ facility has\nbeen constructed to date, the Company has not generated revenue from UN(THINK)™, nor has the Company completed any acquisition of revenue generating companies. The\ncommercial or operating viability of the Company’s business plans have not been proven. There is no assurance that the revenue generated from its operations, and if those\nrevenues, when and if generated, will be sufficient to sustain operations, nonetheless achieve profitability.\nThere is no assurance that the Company’s FORCEGH+™ facilities will operate as intended.\nThe Company’s initial state of its business operations will be to construct and deploy and license its initial FORCEGH+. Accordingly, this component of the Company’s\nbusiness plan is subject to considerable risks, including:\n● the costs of constructing and operating the laboratories may be greater than anticipated;\n● the potential offtake partners who have indicated a willingness to deploy the laboratories at their existing cultivation operations may withdraw and determine not to\ndeploy the laboratories;\n● there is no assurance that the facilities will deliver the intended benefits of high production yields, lower crop losses and reduced operation costs;\n● if the company is not able to fully develop the grow house or it does not operate as intended, it could prevent the company from realizing any of its business goals or\nachieving profitability;\n● the costs of constructing the grow houses may be greater than anticipated and the Company may not be able to recover these greater costs through increases in the\nlease rates, license fees and services fees that it charges to its customers; and\n● the costs of operating the grow house may be greater than anticipated.\nThere is no assurance that UN(THINK)™ will operate as intended.\nThe Company’s plans for developing and advancing the UN(THINK)™ are in its preliminary stages. The Company has yet to fully launch their range of products in either the\nB2B or D2C channels. Accordingly, this component of the Company’s business plan is subject to considerable risks, including:\n● the potential B2B sales may not achieved the planned levels of sales;\n● there is no assurance that the Company’s production partners will deliver the planned production levels or scale;\n● the quality of product from the co-manufacturing may not be sufficient.\n● the cost from co-manufacturing may be greater than anticipated.\n● the demand for the products may not be as high as predicted.\n● the pricing of the products may deter potential buyers and may not cover the cost of production.\n● the brand may not attract sufficient volume.\nThere is no assurance that Hydroxyl Generating Systems will operate as intended.\nThe Company’s plans for developing and expanding sales of the AgriFORCE Clean Solutions are in its preliminary stages. The Company has yet to generate remarkable sales\nof its Hydroxyl products. Accordingly, this component of the Company’s business plan is subject to considerable risks, including:\n● the quality of product from the co-manufacturing may not be sufficient.\n● the cost from co-manufacturing may be greater than anticipated.\n● the demand for the products may not be as high as predicted.\n● the pricing of the products may deter potential buyers and may not cover the cost of production.\n● the brand may not attract sufficient volume.\n● the quality of product from the co-manufacturing may not be sufficient.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of, and synergies from, acquisitions and may become responsible for certain liabilities and integration costs as a result.\nThe businesses we have proposed to acquire have previously operated independently from us. The proposed integrations of our operations with the proposed businesses\nacquisitions are intended to result in financial and operational benefits, and business synergies. There can be no assurance, however, regarding when or the extent to which we\nwill be able to realize these and other benefits. Integration may also be difficult, unpredictable, and subject to delay because of possible company culture conflicts, system\nintegrations, regulatory compliance, and other factors. Difficulties associated with the integration of the proposed business acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on\nour business.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies could result in losses.\nWe incur a portion of our operating expenses in Canadian dollars, and in the future, as we expand into other foreign countries, we expect to incur operating expenses in other\nforeign currencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our international operations are translated from the local functional currency\ninto U.S. dollars upon consolidation. A decline in the U.S. dollar relative to foreign functional currencies would increase our non-U.S. revenue and improve our operating\nresults. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to foreign functional currencies, our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected. We have not\npreviously engaged in foreign currency hedging. If we decide to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate exposure, we may not be able to hedge effectively due to lack of\nexperience, unreasonable costs or illiquid markets.\n16\nThe Company will require additional financing and there is no assurance that additional financing will be available when required.\nThe Company will require substantial additional capital in order to execute its business plan. Existing funds will not be sufficient and additional financing will be needed for\nthis purpose and for other purposes. The Company plans to achieve this additional financing through equity and/or debt financing which will likely be dilutive to the position of\nthen current shareholders. However, there is no assurance that this financing will be available at favorable terms, if at all, when required, given the Company’s small asset base\nand current lack of revenue.\nThe Company had negative cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Company had negative cash flows from operating activities for year ended December 31, 2023. To the extent that the Company has negative cash flows from operating\nactivities in future periods, it may need to allocate a portion of its cash reserves to fund such negative cash flow. The Company may also be required to raise additional funds\nthrough the issuance of equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to generate a positive cash flow from operating activities, that\nadditional capital or other types of financing will be available when needed or that these financings will be on terms favorable to the Company. The Company’s actual financial\nposition and results of operations may differ materially from the expectations of the Company’s management.\nThe Company’s actual financial position and results of operations may differ materially from the expectations of the Company’s management.\nThe Company’s actual financial position and results of operations may differ materially from management’s expectations. The process for estimating the Company’s revenue,\nnet income and cash flow requires the use of judgment in determining the appropriate assumptions and estimates. These estimates and assumptions may be revised as additional\ninformation becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. In addition, the assumptions used in planning may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may\naffect the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. As a result, the Company’s revenue, net income and cash flow may differ materially from the Company’s\nprojected revenue, net income and cash flow.\nThe Company expects to incur significant ongoing costs and obligations related to its investment in infrastructure, growth, regulatory compliance and operations.\nThe Company expects to incur significant ongoing costs and obligations related to its planned investments. To the extent that these costs may be greater than anticipated or the\nCompany may not be able to generate revenues or raise additional financing to cover these costs, these operating expenses could have a material adverse impact on the\nCompany’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, future changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events\ncould increase costs and have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The Company may not be able to recover\nsufficient revenues to offset its higher operating expenses or to recoup its initial capital investment. The Company may incur significant losses in the future for a number of\nreasons, including, unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, and other unknown events. If the Company is unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the\nmarket price of our securities may significantly decrease.\n17\nThere is no assurance the Company will be able to repatriate or distribute funds for investment from the United States to Canada or elsewhere.\nIn the event that any of the Company’s investments, or any proceeds thereof, any dividends or distributions there from, or any profits or revenues accruing from such\ninvestments in the United States were found to be in violation of money laundering legislation or otherwise, such transactions may be viewed as proceeds of crime under\napplicable federal laws, rules and regulations or any other applicable legislation. This could restrict or otherwise jeopardize the ability of the Company to declare or pay\ndividends, effect other distributions or subsequently repatriate such funds back to Canada or elsewhere.\nThe Company may not be able to effectively manage its growth and operations, which could materially and adversely affect its business.\nIf the Company implements it business plan as intended, it may in the future experience rapid growth and development in a relatively short period of time. The management of\nthis growth will require, among other things, continued development of the Company’s financial and management controls and management information systems, stringent\ncontrol of costs, the ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel and the training of new personnel. The Company intends to utilize outsourced resources, and\nhire additional personnel, to manage its expected growth and expansion. Failure to successfully manage its possible growth and development could have a material adverse\neffect on the Company’s business and the value of the shares.\nThe Company may face significant competition from other facilities.\nMany other businesses in California engage in similar activities to the Company, leasing commercial space to agricultural producers generally, and providing additional\nproducts and services to similar customers. The Company cannot assure you that it will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Competitive\npressures faced by the Company could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company may face significant competition from other nutritious food companies.\nWe face significant competition from other nutritious food companies. Many of our competitions may have established brands, more experience and competency in the\nindustry, larger fulfillment infrastructure, significantly more marketing and other financial resources, and larger customers bases than we do. These factors may allow our\ncompetitions to achieve greater net sales and profits. The significant competition faced by the Company could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results\nand financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business may be adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurance that trade secrets and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or circumvented by third parties. Currently, our\nintellectual property includes provisional patents, patent applications, trademarks, trademark applications and know-how related to business, product and technology\ndevelopment. We plan on taking the necessary steps, including but not limited to the filing of additional patents as appropriate. There is no assurance any additional patents will\nissue or that when they do issue they will include all of the claims currently included in the applications. Even if they do issue, those new patents and our existing patents must\nbe protected against possible infringement. Nonetheless, we currently rely on contractual obligations of our employees and contractors to maintain the confidentiality of our\nproducts. To compete effectively, we need to develop and continue to maintain a proprietary position with respect to our technologies, and business. The risks and uncertainties\nthat we face with respect to intellectual property rights principally include the following:\n● Provisional protection may not result in full patents being granted, and any full patent applications that we file may not result in issued patents or may take longer than\nexpected to result in issued patents;\n● we may be subject to interference proceedings;\n● other companies may claim that patents applied for by, assigned or licensed to, us infringe upon their own intellectual property rights;\n● we may be subject to trademark opposition proceedings in the U.S. and in foreign countries;\n18\n● any patents that are issued to us may not provide meaningful protection;\n● we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n● other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to us as invalid, unenforceable or not infringed;\n● other companies may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, or duplicate our technologies;\n● other companies may design around technologies that we have licensed or developed;\n● any patents issued to us may expire and competitors may utilize the technology found in such patents to commercialize their own products; and\n● enforcement of patents is complex, uncertain and expensive.\nIt is also possible that others may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing certain aspects of our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the\npayment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business. If we license patents, our rights will depend on maintaining our obligations to the licensor\nunder the applicable license agreement, and we may be unable to do so. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the work-for-hire, intellectual property assignment and\nconfidentiality agreements entered into by our employees and consultants, advisors and collaborators will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or\nother proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets, know- how or other proprietary information. The scope and enforceability\nof patent claims are not systematically predictable with absolute accuracy. The strength of our own patent rights depends, in part, upon the breadth and scope of protection\nprovided by the patent and the validity of our patents, if any.\nImpairments of the carrying amounts of intangible asset could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur intangible asset balance consists of our patented process to develop germinated whole grain wheat flour. We test our assets for impairment annually or more frequently if\nevents or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of our intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could\ninclude a sustained decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections (for example due\nto regulatory or industry changes), disposals of significant components of our business, unexpected business disruptions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, or\nsignificant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate. We test our intangible asset for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value with its carrying amount. If\nthe carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount.\nWhile there was no single determinative event or factor, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter of 2023 led us to conclude that it\nwas possible that the fair value of our intangible asset was below their carrying amounts. These factors included: (i) a sustained decrease in our share price in 2023, which\nreduced our market capitalization below the book value of net assets; (ii) lack of financing raised during 2023 due to the economic environment (iii) delays in the launch of the\nsale of our UN(THINK) flour. Impairment of Company’s intangible asset could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe operate in an industry with the risk of intellectual property litigation. Claims of infringement against us may hurt our business.\nOur success depends, in part, upon non-infringement of intellectual property rights owned by others and being able to resolve claims of intellectual property infringement\nwithout major financial expenditures or adverse consequences. Participants that own, or claim to own, intellectual property may aggressively assert their rights. From time to\ntime, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others. Future litigation may be necessary to defend us or our clients by\ndetermining the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party proprietary rights or to establish its proprietary rights. Some competitors have substantially greater resources\nand are able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time. In addition, patent holding companies that focus\nsolely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us. Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property\nrights have any merit, these claims are time-consuming and costly to evaluate and defend and could:\n● adversely affect relationships with future clients;\n● cause delays or stoppages in providing products;\n● divert management’s attention and resources;\n● require technology changes to our platform that would cause our Company to incur substantial cost;\n● subject us to significant liabilities; and\n● require us to cease some or all business activities.\n19\nIn addition to liability for monetary damages, which may be tripled and may include attorneys’ fees, or, in some circumstances, damages against clients, we may be prohibited\nfrom developing, commercializing, or continuing to provide some or all of our products unless we obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, the holders of the patents or other\nintellectual property rights, which may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all.\nWe have limited foreign intellectual property rights and may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nWe have limited intellectual property rights outside the United States. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on devices in all countries throughout the world would be\nprohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the\nlaws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties\nfrom practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other\njurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patents to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise\ninfringing products to territories where we have patents, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries,\nparticularly China and certain other developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property, which could make it difficult for\nus to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. To date, we have not sought to enforce any issued\npatents in these foreign jurisdictions. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from\nother aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third\nparties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nThe requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. Certain countries in Europe and developing countries, including China and\nIndia, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our licensors may have\nlimited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents.\nThis could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a\nsignificant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIf we are unable to obtain or defend our patents, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur patent position is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced\nunder our patents or in third-party patents. For example, we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and\nprovisional patents; we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions; others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or\nduplicate any of our technologies; it is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents; our issued patents may not provide a basis for\ncommercially viable technologies, or may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties; and, we may not develop\nadditional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nAs a result, our owned and licensed patents may not be valid and we may not be able to obtain and enforce patents and to maintain trade secret protection for the full\ncommercial extent of our technology. The extent to which we are unable to do so could materially harm our business.\nWe have applied for and will continue to apply for patents for certain products. Such applications may not result in the issuance of any patents, and any patents now held or that\nmay be issued may not provide us with adequate protection from competition. Furthermore, it is possible that patents issued or licensed to us may be challenged successfully. In\nthat event, if we have a preferred competitive position because of such patents, such preferred position would be lost. If we are unable to secure or to continue to maintain a\npreferred position, we could become subject to competition from the sale of generic products. Failure to receive, inability to protect, or expiration of our patents would\nadversely affect our business and operations.\n20\nPatents issued or licensed to us may be infringed by the products or processes of others. The cost of enforcing our patent rights against infringers, if such enforcement is\nrequired, could be significant, and we do not currently have the financial resources to fund such litigation. Further, such litigation can go on for years and the time demands\ncould interfere with our normal operations. We may become a party to patent litigation and other proceedings. The cost to us of any patent litigation, even if resolved in our\nfavor, could be substantial. Many of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater\nfinancial resources. Litigation may also absorb significant management time.\nUnpatented trade secrets, improvements, confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation are important to our scientific and commercial success. Although we\nattempt to and will continue to attempt to protect our proprietary information through reliance on trade secret laws and the use of confidentiality agreements with our partners,\ncollaborators, employees and consultants, as well as through other appropriate means, these measures may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information,\nand, in any event, others may develop independently, or obtain access to, the same or similar information.\nInternational intellectual property protection is particularly uncertain, and if we are involved in opposition proceedings in foreign countries, we may have to expend\nsubstantial sums and management resources.\nPatent and other intellectual property law outside the United States is more uncertain and is continually undergoing review and revisions in many countries. Further, the laws of\nsome foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, certain countries do not grant patent claims\nthat are directed to business methods and processes. In addition, we may have to participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of its foreign patents or its\ncompetitors’ foreign patents, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of its efforts and loss of credibility with customers.\nIf we are found to be infringing on patents or trade secrets owned by others, we may be forced to cease or alter our product development efforts, obtain a license to\ncontinue the development or sale of our products, and/or pay damages.\nOur processes and potential products may violate proprietary rights of patents that have been or may be granted to competitors, universities or others, or the trade secrets of\nthose persons and entities. As our industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our processes and potential products may give rise to claims that they\ninfringe the patents or trade secrets of others. These other persons could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of\nthe affected product or process. If any of these actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to obtain a license in order to\ncontinue to manufacture or market the affected product or use the affected process. Required licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, and the results of\nlitigation are uncertain. If we become involved in litigation or other proceedings, it could consume a substantial portion of our financial resources and the efforts of our\npersonnel.\nWe rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our trade secrets. If these agreements are breached by our employees or other parties, our trade secrets may become known\nto our competitors.\nWe rely on trade secrets that we seek to protect through confidentiality agreements with our employees and other parties. If these agreements are breached, our competitors may\nobtain and use our trade secrets to gain a competitive advantage over us. We may not have any remedies against our competitors and any remedies that may be available to us\nmay not be adequate to protect our business or compensate us for the damaging disclosure. In addition, we may have to expend resources to protect our interests from possible\ninfringement by others.\n21\nWe have a limited operating history on which to judge our business prospects and management.\nOur company was incorporated and commenced operations in 2017. Accordingly, we have only a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our business\nand prospects. Operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability. Our prospects\nmust be considered in light of the risks encountered by companies in the early stage of development, particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. Future\noperating results will depend upon many factors, including increasing the number of affiliates, our success in attracting and retaining motivated and qualified personnel, our\nability to establish short term credit lines, our ability to develop and market new products, control costs, and general economic conditions. We cannot assure you that we will\nsuccessfully address any of these risks.\nWe may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has incurred substantial operating losses since its inception and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never\nbecome profitable. As reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $44.5 million at December 31, 2023, a net loss of\napproximately $11.7 million, and approximately $6.5 million of net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023. The accompanying financial\nstatements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The\nfinancial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that\nmight result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that it can obtain marketing approval to sell, and\nthen generate significant sales, of its technology that is currently in development. As such it is likely that additional financing will be needed by the Company to fund its\noperations and to develop and commercialize its technology. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is\nseeking additional financing to support its growth plans. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing shareholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and\npreferences compared to currently outstanding common shares.\nOur management team will be required to devote substantial time to regulatory compliance which may divert our attention from the day-to-day management of our\nbusiness.\nOur management team will require substantial attention from our senior management and could divert our attention away from the day-to-day management of our business.\nRegulatory compliance is increasingly complex and management may not have experience in all areas of public company compliance. The management team will seek\nassistance from external resources when appropriate for public company regulatory compliance and tax regulatory compliance for applicable jurisdictions.\nThe Company may become subject to litigation, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation, business, results from operations, and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company may be named as a defendant in a lawsuit or regulatory action. The Company may also incur uninsured losses for liabilities which arise in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, or which are unforeseen, including, but not limited to, employment liability and business loss claims. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, results of operations, sales, cash flow or financial condition.\nIf the Company is unable to attract and retain key personnel, it may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe Company’s success has depended and continues to depend upon its ability to attract and retain key management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and\ntechnical experts. The Company will attempt to enhance its management and technical expertise by continuing to recruit qualified individuals who possess desired skills and\nexperience in certain targeted areas. The Company’s inability to retain employees and attract and retain sufficient additional employees or engineering and technical support\nresources could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, sales, cash flow or financial condition. Shortages in qualified personnel or the\nloss of key personnel could adversely affect the financial condition of the Company, results of operations of the business and could limit the Company’s ability to develop and\nmarket its intellectual property. The loss of any of the Company’s senior management or key employees could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to execute the\nCompany’s business plan and strategy, and the Company may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. The Company does not maintain key person\nlife insurance policies on any of the Company’s employees.\n22\nThe size of the Company’s initial target market is difficult to quantify and investors will be reliant on their own estimates on the accuracy of market data.\nBecause high growth crop technology is in an early stage with uncertain boundaries, there is a lack of information about comparable companies available for potential investors\nto review in deciding about whether to invest in the Company and, few, if any, established companies whose business model the Company can follow or upon whose success\nthe Company can build. Accordingly, investors will have to rely on their own estimates in deciding about whether to invest in the Company. There can be no assurance that the\nCompany’s estimates are accurate or that the market size is sufficiently large for its business to grow as projected, which may negatively impact its financial results. The\nCompany regularly follows market research.\nThe Company’s industry is experiencing rapid growth and consolidation that may cause the Company to lose key relationships and intensify competition.\nThe agriculture industry and various verticals within it are undergoing rapid growth and substantial change, which has resulted in an increase in competitors, consolidation and\nformation of strategic relationships. Acquisitions or other consolidating transactions could harm the Company in a number of ways, including by losing strategic partners and or\ncustomers if they are acquired by or enter into relationships with a competitor, losing customers, revenue and market share, or forcing the Company to expend greater resources\nto meet new or additional competitive threats, all of which could harm the Company’s operating results. As competitors enter the market and become increasingly sophisticated,\ncompetition in the Company’s industry may intensify which could negatively impact its profitability.\nThe Company will be reliant on information technology systems and may be subject to damaging cyberattacks.\nThe Company’s operations depend, in part, on how well it and its suppliers protect networks, equipment, information technology systems and software against damage from a\nnumber of threats, including, but not limited to, cable cuts, damage to physical plants, natural disasters, intentional damage and destruction, fire, power loss, hacking, computer\nviruses, vandalism and theft. The Company’s operations also depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks, equipment, IT systems and software, as\nwell as pre-emptive expenses to mitigate the risks of failures. Any of these and other events could result in information system failures, delays and/or increase in capital\nexpenses. The failure of information systems or a component of information systems could, depending on the nature of any such failure, adversely impact the Company’s\nreputation and results of operations.\nThe Company has not experienced any material losses to date relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that the Company\nwill not incur such losses in the future. The Company’s risk and exposure to these matters cannot be fully mitigated because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these\nthreats. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of controls, processes and practices designed to protect systems, computers, software, data\nand networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access is a risk. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend additional resources to\ncontinue to modify or enhance protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\n23\nThe Company’s officers and directors may be engaged in a range of business activities resulting in conflicts of interest.\nAlthough certain officers and board members of the Company are expected to be bound by anti-circumvention agreements limiting their ability to enter into competing and/or\nconflicting ventures or businesses, the Company may be subject to various potential conflicts of interest because some of its officers and directors may be engaged in a range of\nbusiness activities. In addition, the Company’s executive officers and directors may devote time to their outside business interests, so long as such activities do not materially or\nadversely interfere with their duties to the Company. In some cases, the Company’s executive officers and directors may have fiduciary obligations associated with these\nbusiness interests that interfere with their ability to devote time to the Company’s business and affairs and that could adversely affect the Company’s operations. These business\ninterests could require significant time and attention of the Company’s executive officers and directors.\nIn addition, the Company may also become involved in other transactions which conflict with the interests of its directors and the officers who may from time to time deal with\npersons, firms, institutions or companies with which the Company may be dealing, or which may be seeking investments similar to those desired by it. The interests of these\npersons could conflict with those of the Company. In addition, from time to time, these persons may be competing with the Company for available investment opportunities.\nConflicts of interest, if any, will be subject to the procedures and remedies provided under applicable laws. In particular, if such a conflict of interest arises at a meeting of the\nCompany’s directors, a director who has such a conflict will abstain from voting for or against the approval of such participation or such terms. In accordance with applicable\nlaws, the directors of the Company are required to act honestly, in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.\nThere is no guarantee that how the Company uses its available funds will yield the expected results or returns which could impact the business and financial condition of\nthe Company.\nThe Company cannot specify with certainty the particular uses of available funds. Management has broad discretion in the application of its proceeds. Accordingly, a holder of\nshares will have to rely upon the judgment of management with respect to the use of available funds, with only limited information concerning management’s specific\nintentions. The Company’s management may spend a portion or all of the available funds in ways that the Company’s shareholders might not desire, that might not yield a\nfavorable return and that might not increase the value of a purchaser’s investment. The failure by management to apply these funds effectively could harm the Company’s\nbusiness. Pending use of such funds, the Company might invest the available funds in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value.\nOur Articles of incorporation, by-laws and certain Canadian legislation, contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.\nCertain provisions of our by-laws, together or separately, could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control and limit the price that certain\ninvestors may be willing to pay for our common shares. For instance, our by-laws contain provisions that establish certain advance notice procedures for nomination of\ncandidates for election as directors at shareholders’ meetings.\nThe Investment Canada Act requires any person that is non-Canadian (as defined in the Investment Canada Act) who acquires “control” (as defined in the Investment Canada\nAct) of an existing Canadian business to file either a pre-closing application for review or notification with Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. An\nacquisition of control is a reviewable transaction where prescribed financial thresholds are exceeded. The Investment Canada Act generally prohibits the implementation of a\nreviewable transaction unless, after review, the relevant Minister is satisfied that the acquisition is likely to be of net benefit to Canada. Under the national security regime in\nthe Investment Canada Act, the federal government may undertake a discretionary review of a broader range of investments by a non-Canadian to determine whether such an\ninvestment by a non-Canadian could be “injurious to national security.” Review on national security grounds is at the discretion of the federal government and may occur on a\npre- or post-closing basis.\n24\nFurthermore, limitations on the ability to acquire and hold our common shares may be imposed by the Competition Act (Canada). This legislation permits the Commissioner of\nCompetition to review any acquisition or establishment, directly or indirectly, including through the acquisition of shares, of control over or of a significant interest in us. This\nlegislation grants the Commissioner of Competition jurisdiction, for up to one year, to challenge this type of acquisition before the Canadian Competition Tribunal on the basis\nthat it would, or would be likely to, substantially prevent or lessen competition. This legislation also requires any person who intends to acquire our common shares to file a\nnotification with the Canadian Competition Bureau if (i) that person (and their affiliates) would hold, in the aggregate, more than 20% of all of our outstanding voting shares,\n(ii) certain financial thresholds are exceeded, and (iii) no exemption applies. Where a person (and their affiliates) already holds, in the aggregate, more than 20% of all of our\noutstanding voting shares, a notification must be filed if (i) the acquisition of additional shares would bring that person’s (and their affiliates) holdings to over 50%, (ii) certain\nfinancial thresholds are exceeded and (iii) no exemption applies. Where a notification is required, the legislation prohibits completion of the acquisition until the expiration of\nthe applicable statutory waiting period, unless compliance with the waiting period has been waived or the Commissioner of Competition provides written notice that he does\nnot intend to challenge the acquisition. The Commissioner of Competition’s review of a notifiable transaction for substantive competition law considerations may take longer\nthan the statutory waiting period.\nWe are governed by the corporate laws of British Columbia, Canada which in some cases have a different effect on shareholders than the corporate laws of the United\nStates.\nWe are incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “BC Act”) and other relevant laws, which may affect the rights of shareholders differently\nthan those of a company governed by the laws of a U.S. jurisdiction, and may, together with our charter documents, have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging\nanother party from acquiring control of our company by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, or may affect the price an acquiring party would be willing to\noffer in such an instance. The material differences between the BC Act and Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) that may have the greatest such effect include, but\nare not limited to, the following: (i) for certain corporate transactions (such as mergers and amalgamations or amendments to our articles) the BC Act generally requires the\nvoting threshold to be a special resolution approved by 66 2/3% of shareholders, or as set out in the articles, as applicable, whereas DGCL generally only requires a majority\nvote; and (ii) under the BC Act a holder of 5% or more of our common shares can requisition a special meeting of shareholders, whereas such right does not exist under the\nDGCL. We cannot predict whether investors will find our company and our common shares less attractive because we are governed by foreign laws.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Shares\nNew laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial\ncompliance costs and making some activities more time consuming.\nThese laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, may evolve over time as new\nguidance is provided by the courts and other bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing\nrevisions to disclosure and governance practices. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or\ngoverning bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely\naffected.\nAs a public company subject to these rules and regulations, we may find it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to\naccept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of\nour Board of Directors, particularly to serve on its audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\n25\nThe market price of our common shares and Series A Warrants may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell your common shares and Series A Warrants at or above\nthe acquisition price.\nThe market price for our common shares and Series A Warrants may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n● changes in financial or operational estimates or projections;\n● conditions in markets generally;\n● changes in the economic performance or market valuations of companies similar to ours;\n● general economic or political conditions in the United States or elsewhere;\n● any delay in development of our products or services;\n● failure to comply with regulatory requirements;\n● inability to commercially launch products and services and market and generate sales of our products and services,\n● developments or disputes concerning intellectual property rights;\n● our or our competitors’ technological innovations;\n● general and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our expenditures;\n● changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n● announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new technologies, or patents;\n● future sales of our common shares or other securities, including shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or convertible securities or otherwise issued\npursuant to certain contractual rights;\n● period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results; and\n● low or high trading volume of our common shares due to many factors, including the terms of our financing arrangements.\nIn addition, if we fail to reach an important research, development or commercialization milestone or result by a publicly expected deadline, even if by only a small margin,\nthere could be significant impact on the market price of our common shares. Additionally, as we approach the announcement of anticipated significant information and as we\nannounce such information, we expect the price of our common shares to be particularly volatile and negative results would have a substantial negative impact on the price of\nour common shares and Series A Warrants.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of\nsecurities issued by many companies, including for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect our stock price,\nnotwithstanding our operating results. The market price of our common shares and Series A Warrants will fluctuate and there can be no assurances about the levels of the\nmarket prices for our common shares and Series A Warrants.\nIn some cases, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, shareholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those\ncompanies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our business\noperations and reputation.\n26\nAs an “emerging growth company” under applicable law, we will be subject to lessened disclosure requirements, which could leave our shareholders without information\nor rights available to shareholders of more mature companies.\nFor as long as we remain an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting\nrequirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to:\n● not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n● being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly\nreduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure;\n● reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements;\n● taking advantage of an extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standard; and\n● exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not\npreviously approved.\nWe expect to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” Because of these lessened regulatory requirements, our\nshareholders would be left without information or rights available to shareholders of more mature companies. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common shares\nless attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common\nshares and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and have elected to follow certain scaled disclosure requirements available to smaller\nreporting companies.\nBecause we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for an “emerging growth company” our financial\nstatements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us\nto delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private\ncompanies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates and may contain less or\nmore modified disclosure than those public companies. Because our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates,\ninvestors may have difficulty evaluating or comparing our business, performance or prospects in comparison to other public companies, which may have a negative impact on\nthe value and liquidity of our common shares.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit your ability to buy and sell our common shares, which could depress the price of our shares.\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) rules require broker-dealers to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before\nrecommending that investment to the customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make\nreasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status and investment objectives, among other things. Under interpretations of these rules,\nFINRA believes that there is a high probability such speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. Thus, FINRA requirements make it more\ndifficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common shares, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our shares, have an adverse effect on the\nmarket for our shares, and thereby depress our share price.\n27\nIf research analysts do not publish research about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common shares or Series A Warrants, our\nsecurities’ price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our securities may depend in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business. If we do not maintain adequate\nresearch coverage, or if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common shares\nand Series A Warrants could decline. If one or more of our research analysts ceases to cover our business or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our securities\ncould decrease, which could cause the price of our common shares and Series A Warrants or trading volume to decline.\nWe may issue additional equity securities, or engage in other transactions that could dilute our book value or relative rights of our common shares, which may adversely\naffect the market price of our common shares and Series A Warrants.\nOur Board of Directors may determine from time to time that it needs to raise additional capital by issuing additional shares of our common shares or other securities. Except as\notherwise described in this filing, we will not be restricted from issuing additional common shares, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that\nrepresent the right to receive common shares. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our\ncontrol, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future offerings, or the prices at which such offerings may be affected. Additional equity offerings\nmay dilute the holdings of existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common shares and Series A Warrants, or all of them. Holders of our securities are not\nentitled to pre-emptive rights or other protections against dilution. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect,\nthen-current holders of our securities. Additionally, if we raise additional capital by making offerings of debt or preference shares, upon our liquidation, holders of our debt\nsecurities and preference shares, and lenders with respect to other borrowings, may receive distributions of its available assets before the holders of our common shares.\nAn investment in our Series A Warrants is speculative in nature and could result in a loss of your investment therein.\nThe Series A Warrants do not confer any rights of common share ownership on their holders, such as voting rights or the right to receive dividends, but rather merely represent\nthe right to acquire shares of our common shares at a fixed price for a limited period of time. Specifically, commencing on the date of issuance, holders of the Series A Warrants\nmay exercise their right to acquire the common shares and pay an exercise price of $300 per share (exercising 50 warrants at $6 per warrant to receive one common share),\nprior to three years from the date of issuance, after which date any unexercised Series A Warrants will expire and have no further value. Moreover, the market value of the\nSeries A Warrants is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the market value of the Series A Warrants will equal or exceed their initial price. There can be no assurance\nthat the market price of the common shares will ever equal or exceed the exercise price of the Series A Warrants, and consequently, whether it will ever be profitable for holders\nof the Series A Warrants to exercise the Series A Warrants.\nOur Series A Warrants and contain a provision which only permits securities claims to be brought in federal court.\nSection 11 of our Series A Warrants states in relevant part: “The Company hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in The\nCity of New York, Borough of Manhattan (except for claims brought under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,\nwhich must be brought in federal court)”. Therefore any claims with respect to our Series A Warrants brought under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act\nmust be brought in federal court while all other claims may be brought in federal or state court. Proceedings in federal court may be more expensive than in state court due to\nmore comprehensive rules on how discovery and motion and trial practice are handled. This provision may have a dampening effect on claims brought under these securities\nlaws or limit the ability of the investor to bring a claim in the jurisdiction it deems more favorable. This provision is likely enforceable as requirements regarding bringing\nsecurities claims have been met, but it may have the overall effect of discouraging litigation due to the circumstances described herein.\n28\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future, and consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will\ndepend on appreciation in the price of our common shares.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common shares and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common shares in the foreseeable\nfuture. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their\ninvestments.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\nWe are committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems and the data they contain from cybersecurity threats. We acknowledge\nthat cybersecurity is a dynamic and evolving area of risk that requires ongoing assessment, management, and oversight. As we grow in size and revenue, we intend to work with\nthird party companies to assess, identify, manage, and mitigate material cybersecurity threats, as well as to respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents, all as necessary.\nWe recognize the importance of maintaining our technology and data systems. Our cybersecurity policies, standards, processes, and practices are integrated across our\noperational departments.\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nAs one of the elements of our overall risk management program, we focus on the following key areas:\nTechnical Safeguards: We have commenced to implement technical safeguards, including by not limited to firewalls, anti-malware functionality and access controls.\nOutside Consultants: We have identified and, as appropriate and when we have the budget to do so, will utilize outside consultants, including contractors and other third\nparties, to among other things, conduct regular testing of our networks and systems to identify vulnerabilities through penetration testing, while also measuring and advising on\npotential improvements to our incident prevention, response, and documentation procedures.\nWe have not encountered cybersecurity threats or experienced previously cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected or that we believe are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\nGovernance\nBoard of Directors Oversight\nOur Board is aware of the critical nature of managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats. Management works with our Board to establish oversight mechanisms to\nensure effective governance in managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats because we recognize the significance of these threats to our operational integrity and\nstakeholder confidence. The Board has delegated to our Audit Committee the primary responsibility for oversight of cybersecurity risks.\nManagement’s Role Managing Risk\nOur Executive Team plays a primary role in informing the Audit Committee on cybersecurity risks. These individuals monitor activity and potential risks related to the day-to-\nday operations of the business, including reviewing results of the work of our outside consultants. They will provide briefings to the Audit Committee on a periodic basis\nregarding cybersecurity matters, including but not limited to the following:\n● Current cybersecurity landscape and emerging threats;\n● Status of ongoing cybersecurity initiatives and strategies;\n● Incident reporting, if any, and learning from any cybersecurity events;\n● Risk mitigation efforts and insurance, and\n● Compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standard.\nItem 2. Properties\nThe Company currently leases office space at 800-525 West 8th Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1C6 as its principal office. The Company will be moving to a virtual office model\nin order to reallocate rent expenditures to operations.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are subject to the legal proceedings and claims described in detail in “Note 21. Commitments and Contingencies” to the audited financial statements included in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not believe the\noutcome of such legal proceeding and claims, if determined adversely to us, would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n29\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket information\nOur common stock is currently quoted on Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “AGRI”, and warrants under the symbol “AGRIW”. The market price has been volatile.\nOn March 29, 2024, the closing price for our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market was $0.18 per share.\nSecurities outstanding and holders of record\nOn April 1, 2024, there were approximately 5,467 shareholders of record for our common stock and 22,573,938 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our common shares. However, we have paid common share dividends on our preferred stock. Our preferred stock was retired and\nthere were no preferred shares outstanding after the IPO. We anticipate that we will retain funds and future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and\ndevelopment of our business. Therefore, we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay cash\ndividends on our common shares will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and\nother factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, the terms of any future debt or credit financings may preclude us from paying dividends.\nInformation respecting equity compensation plans\nThe Company adopted a stock option plan originally on December 12, 2018 (the “Option Plan”), as amended, under which the compensation committee of the Board (the\n“Compensation Committee”) may from time to time in its discretion, recommend changes to the Option Plan to grant to directors, officers, employees and consultants of the\nCompany non-transferable options to purchase common shares (“Options”). The Board of Directors review recommendations and approve changes. As of the date of this\nfilling, the Company has 76,114 Options outstanding, and [2,129,652] Options available for future issuances. The Option Plan was approved by the shareholders of the\nCompany on June 10, 2019.\nThe following table provides information with respect to options outstanding under our Plan as at December 31, 2023:\nNumber of\nsecurities to Weighted- Number of\nbe issued average securities\nupon exercise exercise price remaining\nof of available for\noutstanding outstanding future\nPlan category options options issuance\nEquity compensation plans approved by security holders 76,114 $ 41.75 2,181,280\nEquity compensation plans not approved by security holders - - -\nTotal 76,114 $ 41.75 2,181,280\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nThe Company had the following sales of unregistered securities during the three months ended March 31, 2023:\n300 common shares were issued to consultants.\n32,742 common shares were issued upon conversion of prefunded warrants.\n14,216 common shares were issued upon conversion of convertible debt.\n3,118 common shares were issued as part of compensation to Company officers.\nThe Company had the following sales of unregistered securities during the three months ended June 30, 2023:\n30\n250 common shares were issued to consultants.\n10,208 common shares were issued upon conversion of prefunded warrants.\n36,111 common shares upon conversion of convertible debt in lieu of repayment in cash.\n20,000 common shares issued to a shareholder in a private placement.\nThe Company had the following sales of unregistered securities during the three months ended September 30, 2023:\n350 common shares were issued to consultants.\n59,660 common shares were issued upon conversion of prefunded warrants.\n422,194 common shares upon conversion of convertible debt in lieu of repayment in cash.\n31,889 common shares were issued as part of compensation to Company officers and employees.\nThe Company had the following sales of unregistered securities during the three months ended December 31, 2023:\n580,000 common shares were issued to consultants.\n38,565 common shares were issued upon conversion of prefunded warrants.\n2,694,611 common shares were issued upon conversion of convertible debt.\n1,399,928 common shares upon conversion of convertible debt in lieu of repayment in cash.\nOn October 18, 2023, a Debenture Investor purchased an additional tranche totaling $2,750,000 in convertible debentures and received 620,230 warrants.

Operating expenses decreased in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to December 31, 2022 by $2,500,658 or 18% primarily due to\nthe following:\n● Professional fees and consulting decreased by $1,480,038 and $1,280,672, respectively due to a significant decrease in M&A spending during 2023 as a result of the\nCompany focusing on organic growth of currently active ventures.\n● Research and development decreased by $609,104 due to limited research services procured during 2023 as compared to expenditures paid to RCS in 2022 as well as\ndesign and construction fees that were only incurred in 2022.\n● Investor and public relations expenses decreased by $459,711 due to more investor and public relations advisory services utilized in 2022 for communication.\n● Wages and salaries decreased by $441,530 due to a reduction in staff head count in 2023.\n● Office and administrative decreased by $286,012 due to overall cost cutting initiatives during 2023.\n● Travel and entertainment decreased by $170,614 due to a reduction in travel for foreign business development.\n● Sales and marketing decreased by $165,290 due to significant reductions in public relations agency work and social media contracted fees from cost cutting initiatives.\n● Share based compensation decreased $99,864 due to a significant number of option forfeitures from lower staff head count.\n● Shareholder and regulatory decreased $99,611 due to lower Rule 144 share releases in 2023.\n● Lease expense decreased $28,945 due to the termination of the Company’s long term office lease in 2023.\nThis was partially offset by the following:\n● Write down of construction in progress deposit of $1,963,304 due to the termination of an agreement with a construction contractor.\n● Depreciation and amortization increased $657,431 due to the beginning of amortization of the intangible asset which became available for use in January 2023.\nOther Expenses / (Income)\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased due to the following:\n● Accretion interest on debentures increased by $4,566,721 due to the issuance of three additional tranches of convertible debentures during the year.\n● Loss on conversion of convertible debt increased by $1,284,703 (gain of $93,973 – 2022) from the conversions of $6,970,382 in principal and interest during the year\n($150,000 of principal – 2022) of convertible debentures into the Company’s common shares at a loss.\n● Loss on debt extinguishment increased by $680,935 (nil – 2022) as a result of the conversion of $1,489,974 of principal from the First Tranche Debentures into the\nCompany’s common shares which triggered an extinguishment of debt due to the change of the fair value of the debt after the conversion.\n● Foreign exchange loss increased by $365,088 due to a higher average cash balance during 2022 coupled with an increasing USD to CAD rate throughout versus a lower\naverage cash balance during 2023 which saw several large decreases in USD to CAD rates throughout.\nThis was partially offset by the following:\n● Change in fair value of derivative liabilities increased by $5,641,017 due to a significant decrease in the Company’s per share price of 99% during the period.\n● All other items aggregate to $107,040.\n33\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In\norder to determine if assets have been impaired, assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable independent cash flows are available (“asset group”). An\nimpairment loss is recognized when the sum of projected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group. The measurement of the impairment loss to\nbe recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group. Fair value has been determined using a market approach.\nFair value determinations of intangible assets require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating\nthe fair value of our intangible asset requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. These\nassumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, discount rates, growth rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. If current\nexpectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change, or if management’s expectations or plans\notherwise change, then our intangible might become impaired in the future.\nOur intangible asset balance consists of our patented process to develop germinated whole grain wheat flour. We test our assets for impairment annually or more frequently if\nevents or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of our intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could\ninclude a sustained decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections (for example due\nto regulatory or industry changes), disposals of significant components of our business, unexpected business disruptions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, or\nsignificant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate.\nWhile there was no single determinative event or factor, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter of 2023 led us to conclude that it\nwas possible that the fair value of our intangible asset was below their carrying amounts. These factors included: (i) a sustained decrease in our share price in 2023, which\nreduced our market capitalization below the book value of net assets; (ii) lack of financing raised during 2023 due to the economic environment (iii) delays in the launch of the\nsale of our UN(THINK) flour;\nAccordingly, we performed an impairment test on our intangible asset as of December 31, 2023 based on the asset’s fair value based on net assets. As a result of our impairment\ntest, we determined that the intangible asset was not impaired as of December 31, 2023. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, our market capitalization continued to decrease\nindicating that the intangible asset may be impaired in the foreseeable future.\nEquity-linked instruments\nThe fair value of the Company’s warrants is determined in accordance with FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” which establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes\nthe assumptions (inputs) to valuation techniques used to price assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The guidance for fair value measurements requires\nthat assets and liabilities measured at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\n● Level 1: Defined as observable inputs, such as quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n● Level 2: Defined as observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. This includes quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for\nsubstantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n● Level 3: Defined as unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the\nfair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.\nThe Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”),\nwhich provides that if three criteria are met, the Company is required to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing\nderivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which;\n(a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract;\n(b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally\naccepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur; and\n(c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.\nASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional as defined under professional standards as “The Meaning of\nConventional Convertible Debt Instrument.”\nThe Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) in\naccordance with professional standards when “Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features,” as those professional standards pertain to “Certain\nConvertible Instruments.”\nThe debenture conversion features are categorized as a Level 3 financial instrument. The Company utilized the Monte Carlo option-pricing for valuing the convertible features.\nThe First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Tranche of Debenture Warrants, collectively (the “Debenture Warrants”) are categorized as a Level 3 financial instrument. The\nCompany utilized the Monte Carlo option-pricing model to value the Debenture Warrants.\nThe most subjective assumptions in such option pricing models include the implied volatility, expected term, risk-free rate and the probability of triggering the down-round\nprovisions.\nShare Based Compensation\nThe Company uses the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each optionee’s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting\nperiod, and estimates the fair value of stock-based awards to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option-valuation model (the “Black-Scholes model”). This model\nincorporates certain assumptions for inputs including a risk-free market interest rate, expected dividend yield of the underlying common stock, expected option life, and\nexpected volatility in the market value of the underlying common stock. The Company recognizes any forfeitures as they occur.\n34\nIncome Taxes\nCurrent tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted at period-end.\nDeferred tax assets, including those arising from tax loss carryforwards, requires management to assess the likelihood that the Company will generate sufficient taxable\nearnings in future periods in order to utilize recognized deferred tax assets. Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on management’s estimates of\nfuture cash flows. In addition, future changes in tax laws could limit the ability of the Company to obtain tax deductions in future periods. To the extent that future cash flows\nand taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date could be impacted.\nThe Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by various tax authorities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company’s primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and general corporate purposes. The Company’s ability to fund\noperations and make planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations depends on future operating performance and cash flows, which are subject to prevailing\neconomic conditions, financial markets, business and other factors. We recorded a net loss of $11,733,210 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $12,873,102 for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022; and recorded an accumulated deficit of $44,507,304 as of December 31, 2023 ($32,774,094 – as of December 31, 2022). Net cash used in\noperating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $6,505,072 compared to $12,079,359 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nWe had $3,878,578 in cash as at December 31, 2023 as compared to $2,269,320 as at December 31, 2022.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n● the cost and timing of our regulatory activities, especially the process to obtain regulatory approval for our intellectual properties in the U.S. and foreign countries;\n● the costs of R&D activities we undertake to further develop our technology;\n● the costs of constructing our grow houses, including any impact of complications, delays, and other unknown events;\n● the costs of commercialization activities, including sales, marketing and production;\n● the costs of our mergers and acquisitions activity;\n● the level of working capital required to support our growth; and\n● our need for additional personnel, information technology or other operating infrastructure to support our growth and operations as a public company.\n35\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal\ncourse of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and\nclassification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company is at an early stage of development. As such it is likely that additional financing\nwill be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to develop and commercialize its technology. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nFor the next twelve months from issuance of these financial statements, the Company will seek to obtain additional capital through the sale of debt or equity financings or other\narrangements to fund operations; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise needed capital under acceptable terms, if at all. The sale of\nadditional equity may dilute existing shareholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences compared to currently outstanding common shares. Issued\ndebt securities may contain covenants and limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders. If the Company is unable to obtain such\nadditional financing, future operations would need to be scaled back or discontinued. Due to the uncertainty in the Company’s ability to raise capital, management believes that\nthere is substantial doubt in the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements.\nCash Flows\nThe net cash used by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $6,505,072 compared to $12,079,359 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change\nof $5,574,287 was primarily due to the following:\n● A decrease in net loss of $1,139,892 due to operating expenses noted above.\n● An increase to amortization of debt issuance costs of $4,707,047 from the issuance of three additional tranches of convertible debentures during the year.\n● Write down of construction in progress deposit of $1,963,304 due to the termination of an agreement with a construction contractor.\n● A favorable change in working capital of $1,277,878 driven by the utilization of a prepaid retainer balance for investor relations services as well as amortization of deferred\noffering costs for usage of the Company’s “At The Market” financing facility in 2023 and by a delay in payment of trade payables as part of a cash savings initiative.\n● An increase to the loss on debt conversions and debt extinguishment of $1,284,703 and $680,935, respectively due to significant debt conversions.\n● An increase to depreciation and amortization $657,431 due to the beginning of amortization of the intangible asset which became available for use in January 2023.\nThis was partially offset by the following:\n● Non-cash change in the fair value of derivative liabilities of $5,641,017 due to decreased securities prices.\n● A decrease of shares issued for compensation of $435,851 due to lower employee headcount during 2023.\n● All other items in an aggregate amount of $60,035.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was for the purchase of an equity investment in RCS for $225,000. The net cash used in\ninvesting activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was related to the payment against acquisition of IP intangible asset of $500,000 and acquisition of equipment and\nleasehold improvements amounting to $104,986 due to increased staffing and office renovations, respectively. All other items aggregated to $35,028.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, represents net proceeds from debentures of $9,615,385 as well as common shares issued for\ncash of $1,342,915. This was partially offset by repayments on convertible debentures of $2,143,091, financing costs of debentures of $387,917 and share issuance costs of\n$153,220. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 represents net proceeds from debentures of $12,750,000. This was partially offset by\nfinancing costs of debentures of $1,634,894 and repayments of $2,805,000 as well as payment of $750,000 for the acquisition of an intangible asset.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nAs a registrant that qualifies as a smaller reporting company, AgriFORCE™ is not required to provide the information required by this Item.\n36\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of\nAgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph – Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 2, the\nCompany has a significant working capital deficiency, has incurred significant losses and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These\nconditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Marcum LLP\nMarcum LLP (PCAOB ID 688)\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020\nCosta Mesa, CA\nApril 1, 2024\nF-1\nAGRIFORCE GROWING SYSTEMS LTD.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Expressed in US dollars)\nNote December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent\nCash $ 3,878,578 $ 2,269,320\nOther receivable 30,859 48,941\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 4 272,872 598,342\nInventories 5 38,857 -\nTotal current assets 4,221,166 2,916,603\nNon-current\nProperty and equipment, net 6 11,801 121,672\nIntangible asset, net 7 12,733,885 13,089,377\nOperating lease right-of-use asset 20 -

BUSINESS OVERVIEW\nAgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. (“AgriFORCE™” of the “Company”) was incorporated as a private company by Articles of Incorporation issued pursuant to the provisions\nof the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on December 22, 2017. The Company’s registered and records office address is at 800 – 525 West 8th Avenue, Vancouver,\nBritish Columbia, Canada, V5Z 1C6.\nThe Company is an innovative agriculture-focused technology company that delivers reliable, financially robust solutions for high value crops through our proprietary facility\ndesign and automation Intellectual Property to businesses and enterprises globally through our AgriFORCE™ Solutions division (“Solutions”) and delivers nutritious food\nproducts through our AgriFORCE™ Brands division (“Brands”). During 2023, the Company launched its Un(THINK) Awakened Flour™ flour, which is a nutritious flour that\nprovides many health advantages over traditional flour.\nSolutions intends to operate in the plant based pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and other high value crop markets using its unique proprietary facility design and hydroponics\nbased automated growing system that enable cultivators to effectively grow crops in a controlled environment (“FORCEGH+™”). The Company has designed FORCEGH+™\nfacilities to produce in virtually any environmental condition and to optimize crop yields to as near their full genetic potential possible whilst substantially eliminating the need\nfor the use of pesticides and/or irradiation. The Company also has a global license to sell and distribute hydroxyl devices. During 2023, the Company completed sales and\ndeliveries of its hydroxyl devices.\nBrands is focused on the development and commercialization of plant-based ingredients and products that deliver healthier and more nutritious solutions. We will market and\ncommercialize both branded consumer product offerings and ingredient supply.\n2. BASIS OF PREPARATION\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying audited consolidated financial statements (the “financial statements”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\nThe financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company’s management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. In the opinion\nof the Company’s management, the financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation.\nPrincipal of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We consolidate variable interest entities (VIEs) when we have variable interests\nand are the primary beneficiary. The Company has no VIEs.\nAll inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its\nwholly owned subsidiaries:\nName of entity: Country of Incorporation Purpose Date of Incorporation\nAgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd.

Currency conversion to USD is performed in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign\nCurrency Matters.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates reflected in these financial statements include, but are not limited to,\naccounting for share-based compensation, valuation of derivative liabilities, valuation of embedded conversion feature, going concern, impairment as well as depreciation\nmethod. Actual results could differ from these estimates and those differences could be material.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company has incurred substantial operating losses since its inception, and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never\nbecome profitable. As reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $44.5 million at December 31, 2023, a net loss of\napproximately $11.7 million, and approximately $6.5 million of net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023. The accompanying financial\nstatements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The\nfinancial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that\nmight result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that it can obtain marketing approval to sell, and\nthen generate significant sales, of its technology that is currently in development. The Company will need to raise additional capital in order to fund its operations and to\ndevelop and commercialize its technology. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is seeking additional\nfinancing to support its growth plans. The sale of additional equity may dilute existing shareholders and newly issued shares may contain senior rights and preferences\ncompared to currently outstanding common shares.\nF-7\nReverse Stock Split\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company executed a one-for-fifty reverse stock split of the Company’s common shares (the “Reverse Split”). As a result of the Reverse Split, every\n50 shares of the Company’s old common shares were converted into one share of the Company’s new common shares. Fractional shares resulting from the reverse split were\nrounded up to the nearest whole number. The Reverse Split automatically and proportionately adjusted all issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common shares, as\nwell as convertible debentures, convertible features, prefunded warrants, stock options and warrants outstanding at the time of the date of the Reverse Split. The exercise price\non outstanding equity based-grants was proportionately increased, while the number of shares available under the Company’s equity-based plans was proportionately reduced.\nShare and per share data (except par value) for the periods presented reflect the effects of the Reverse Split. References to numbers of common shares and per share data in the\naccompanying financial statements and notes thereto for periods ended prior to October 11, 2023 have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split on a retroactive basis.\n3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nCash\nThe Company’s cash consists of cash maintained in checking and interest-bearing accounts. The Company accounts for financial instruments with original maturities of three\nmonths or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents. The Company held no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nInventories\nInventories consist of finished goods of milled flour and related packaging material recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value with the cost measured using the\naverage cost method. Inventories includes all costs that relate to bringing the inventory to its present condition and location under normal operating conditions.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are initially recognized at acquisition cost or manufacturing cost, including any costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to the location and\ncondition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the Company’s management. Property, plant and equipment are subsequently measured at\ncost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\nDepreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis to write down the cost less estimated residual value of computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. The following useful\nlives are applied:\nComputer equipment 3 years\nFurniture and fixtures 7 years\nLeasehold improvements Lower of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\nGains or losses arising on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets\nand are recognized in profit or loss within other income or other expenses.\nConstruction in progress includes construction progress payments, deposits, engineering costs, interest expense for debt financing on long-term construction projects and other\ncosts directly related to the construction of the facilities. Expenditures are capitalized during the construction period and construction in progress is transferred to the relevant\nclass of property and equipment when the assets are available for use, at which point the depreciation of the asset commences.\nDefinite Lived Intangible Asset\nDefinite lived intangible asset consists of a granted patent. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. The estimated\nuseful life of the granted patent is 20 years and the patent was available for use starting January 2023.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In\norder to determine if assets have been impaired, assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable independent cash flows are available (“asset group”). An\nimpairment loss is recognized when the sum of projected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group. The measurement of the impairment loss to\nbe recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group. Fair value can be determined using a market approach, income\napproach or cost approach. The reversal of impairment losses is prohibited.\nF-8\nInvestments\nThe Company accounts for its investments in accordance with ASC 321, Investments – Equity Securities (“ASC 321”). The Company’s investment does not have a readily\ndeterminable fair value, therefore the Company has elected to account for its investment at cost, less impairment. Adjustments to fair value are made when there are observable\ntransactions that provide an indicator of fair value. Additionally, if qualitative factors demonstrate a potential impairment to the investment, fair value must be estimated, and\nthe investment written down if the fair value is lower than the carrying value.\nConvertible Instruments\nThe Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”),\nwhich provides that if three criteria are met, the Company is required to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing\nderivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which;\n(a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract;\n(b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally\naccepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur; and\n(c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.\nASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional as defined under professional standards as “The Meaning of\nConventional Convertible Debt Instrument.”. Accordingly, the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options\nembedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the\neffective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption.\nThe Company also records when necessary deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the\nfair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. ASC 815 provides that,\namong other things, generally, if an event is not within the entity’s control or could require net cash settlement, then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability.\nLeases\nThe Company determines at the inception of a contract if the arrangement is or contains a lease. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract gives the right to control the use\nof an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company classifies leases at the lease commencement date as operating or finance leases and\nrecords a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with an initial lease term of greater than 12 months. Leases with an initial term of 12 months\nor less are not recorded on the balance sheet, but payments are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company’s contracts can contain both lease and non-lease components. The non-lease components may include maintenance, utilities, and other operating costs. The\nCompany combines the lease and non-lease components of fixed costs in its leases as a single lease component. Variable costs, such as utilities or maintenance costs, are not\nincluded in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. These costs are expensed when the event determining the amount of variable consideration to be paid\noccurs.\nLease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of future lease payments over the expected lease term. The Company\ndetermines the present value of future lease payments by using its estimated secured incremental borrowing rate for that lease term as the interest rate implicit in the lease is not\nreadily determinable. The Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate for each lease based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an\namount equal to the lease payments over a similar term.\nF-9\nRevenue Recognition\nProduct revenue in 2023 was limited to sales from hydroxyl generators and will expand to include sales of our un(Think) Foods products in 2024. We recognize product\nrevenue when we satisfy performance obligations by transferring control of the promised products or services to customers. Product revenue is recognized at a point in time\nwhen control of the promised good or service is transferred to the customer, which is at the point of shipment or delivery of the goods.\nContract Balances\nWe recognize a receivable when the Company has a right to consideration for which the Company has completed the performance obligations and only the passage of time is\nrequired before payment of that consideration is due.\nWe recognize a contract asset when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing.\nWe recognize a contract liability when a customer provides payment to the Company for a performance obligation not yet satisfied.\nPayment terms generally require payments within 30 days.\nLoss per Common Share\nThe Company presents basic and diluted loss per share data for its common shares. Basic loss per common share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to\ncommon shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The number of common shares used in the loss per\nshares calculation includes all outstanding common shares plus all common shares issuable for which there are no conditions to issue other than time. Diluted loss per common\nshare is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of common shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive share equivalents, such as stock\noptions and warrants and assumes the receipt of proceeds upon exercise of the dilutive securities to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased at the average\nmarket price during the year.\nResearch and Development\nExpenditure on research and development activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognized as expense\nwhen incurred.\nForeign Currency Transactions\nThe financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the local currencies are translated into USD for consolidation as follows: assets\nand liabilities at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, shareholders’ equity at the historical rates of exchange, and income and expense amounts at the average\nexchange rate for the period. Translation adjustments resulting from the translation of the subsidiaries’ accounts are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income” as\nequity in the consolidated balance sheets. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the\nexchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the reporting currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet\ndate. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included within non-\noperating expenses.\nFair value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturities of\nthese items.\nF-10\nAs part of the issuance of debentures on June 30, 2022, January 17, 2023, October 18, 2023 and November 30, 2023 as well as the private placement on June 20, 2023, the\nCompany issued warrants having strike price denominated in USD. This creates an obligation to issue shares for a price that is not denominated in the Company’s functional\ncurrency and renders the warrants not indexed to the Company’s stock, and therefore, must be classified as a derivative liability and measured at fair value at the end of each\nreporting period. On the same basis, the Series A Warrants and the representative warrants issued as part of the IPO are also classified as a derivative liability and measured at\nfair value.\nThe fair value of the Company’s warrants is determined in accordance with FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” which establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes\nthe assumptions (inputs) to valuation techniques used to price assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to\nunadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The guidance for fair value measurements requires\nthat assets and liabilities measured at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\n● Level 1: Defined as observable inputs, such as quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n● Level 2: Defined as observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. This includes quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for\nsubstantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n● Level 3: Defined as unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the\nfair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.\nIncome Taxes\nCurrent tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted at period-end.\nDeferred tax assets, including those arising from tax loss carryforwards, requires management to assess the likelihood that the Company will generate sufficient taxable\nearnings in future periods in order to utilize recognized deferred tax assets. Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on management’s estimates of\nfuture cash flows. In addition, future changes in tax laws could limit the ability of the Company to obtain tax deductions in future periods. To the extent that future cash flows\nand taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date could be impacted.\nThe Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by various tax authorities.\nF-11\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process whereby (1) a determination is made as to whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will\nbe sustained based on the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold the Company recognizes the\nlargest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest\nand penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Significant judgment is required in the identification of uncertain tax positions\nand in the estimation of penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions.\nThere were no material uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nShare Based Compensation\nThe Company generally uses the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each optionee’s requisite service period, which is generally the\nvesting period, and estimates the fair value of stock-based awards to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option-valuation model (the “Black-Scholes model”).\nThis model incorporates certain assumptions for inputs including a risk-free market interest rate, expected dividend yield of the underlying common stock, expected option life,\nand expected volatility in the market value of the underlying common stock. The Company recognizes any forfeitures as they occur.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Start-ups Act\nof 2012, (the “JOBS Act”). Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section\n13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an\nemerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 “Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own\nEquity” (“ASU 2020-06”). The intention of ASU 2020-06 is to address the complexities in accounting for certain financial instruments with a debt and equity component.\nUnder ASU 2020-06, the number of accounting models for convertible notes will be reduced and entities that issue convertible debt will be required to use the if-converted\nmethod for the computation of diluted “Earnings per share” under ASC 260. ASC 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and may be adopted\nthrough either a modified retrospective method of transition or a fully retrospective method of transition. ASU 2020-06 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2023. Since\nthe Company had a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 and its convertible debentures were determined to be anti-dilutive, there was no material impact to its basic\nand diluted net loss per share for the period as a result of adopting ASU 2020-06.\nF-12\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses.” The standard, including subsequently issued amendments, requires a financial asset\nmeasured at amortized cost basis, such as accounts receivable and certain other financial assets, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on relevant\ninformation about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.\nThis ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and requires the modified retrospective approach. ASU\n2016-13 was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2023. Based on the composition of the Company’s affected financial assets, current market conditions, and historical credit\nloss activity, the adoption did not have a material impact to these annual financial statements.\nIn October 2021, FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.\nUnder ASU 2021-08, an acquirer must recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. The\nguidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2021-08 was adopted on January 1, 2023 and did\nnot have a material impact to these annual financial statements.\nIn November 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 820): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” ASU 2023-07 provides guidance to\nimprove reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2023. We are currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on our financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” ASU 2023-09 requires companies to provide\nenhanced rate reconciliation disclosures, including disclosure of specific categories and additional information for reconciling items. The standard also requires companies to\ndisaggregate income taxes paid by federal, state and foreign taxes. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nDebenture principal repayments\nThe following table summarizes the future principal payments related to our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2023:\n2024 $ 7,666,599\n2025 3,143,538\n2026 660,000\n$ 11,470,137\nContingencies\nLitigation\nOn August 11, 2023, AgriFORCE’s former CEO, Ingo Wilhelm Mueller filed a Notice of Civil Claim in which he alleges that AgriFORCE wrongfully terminated his\nemployment without notice, in breach of the parties’ underlying employment agreement. Mr. Mueller alleges to have suffered damages including, among other things, a loss of\nbase salary of $473,367 CAD per annum and damages from not receiving common stock of AgriFORCE equivalent in value to $468,313 CAD. AgriFORCE’s position is that\nMr. Mueller was terminated for ‘just cause’ because he breached his fiduciary duty to act in AgriFORCE’s best interest by, among other things, submitting a sizeable bid for the\nacquisition of a company without first obtaining Board approval. In doing so, Mr. Mueller misrepresented AgriFORCE’s financial standing and forged, or instructed others to\nforge, a document by affixing the electronic signature of AgriFORCE’s CFO.\nAs at December 31, 2023, the parties were in the discovery stage of litigation. AgriFORCE has produced relevant documents to Mr. Mueller, and is awaiting Mr. Mueller’s\nproduction of relevant documents. The parties are also in the process of scheduling examinations for discovery. Management is instructing counsel to advance the matter given\nthe relative strength of AgriFORCE’s case.\nThe likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is relatively low given the facts supporting AgriFORCE’s ‘for cause’ termination of Mr. Mueller as well as the significant expense\nthat Mr. Mueller would have to incur to advance this matter to trial.\nOn September 31, 2023, Stronghold filed a Complaint with the Superior Court of California for Breach of Contract; Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing;\nand Common Count: Goods and Services Rendered in relation to the purchase and sale agreement for the Coachella property (Note 4). Stronghold alleges that AgriFORCE\nbreached the PSA by failing to deposit certain stocks certificates into Escrow, failing to pay amounts owed for its costs incurred in connection with the Sellers Work, and for\nterminating the PSA despite Stronghold’s performance of the Sellers Work. Stronghold is claiming $451,684.00 plus interest in damages based on invoices it provided.\nAgriFORCE will dispute, among other things, the amount and invoices, estimating approximately $230,000 as Stronghold’s true expenses that may be claimed. The Company\nfiled their answer on February 26, 2024. The trial date has not been set for this case.\n22. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events through April 1, 2024, the date on which these financial statements were available to be issued, to ensure that this filing includes\nappropriate disclosure of events both recognized in the financial statements as of December 31, 2023, and events which occurred subsequent to December 31, 2023 but were\nnot recognized in the financial statements.\nFrom January 1, 2024 through April 1, 2024, the Company issued 16,493,602 common shares upon conversion of convertible debt and conversion of convertible debt in lieu of\nrepayment in cash (principal and interest of $4,062,217).\nFrom January 1, 2024 through April 1, 2024, the Company issued 112,645 common shares as part of compensation to Company officers.\nFrom January 1, 2024 through April 1, 2024, the Company issued 126,646 common shares to consultants for services rendered.\nOn February 21, 2024, an Investor purchased an additional tranche of $1,100,000. The convertible debt and warrants were issued with an exercise price of $0.214. The issuance\nof the additional tranche triggered the down round provision, adjusting the exercise prices of the First, Second, Third and Fourth Tranche Debentures and the First, Second,\nThird and Fourth Tranche Warrants to $0.214.\nF-24\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures\n(as defined in Rules 13a—15(e) and 15d—15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), as of the end of the period covered by this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will\nprevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the\ncontrol system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances\nof fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns\ncan occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by\nmanagement override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be\nno assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements\ndue to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange\nAct). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the individuals serving as our\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management conducted an assessment of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nAttestation Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to the deferral allowed given we are neither\nan accelerated nor a large accelerated filer.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

The presentation must include a description of, among other things, the material facts, the direct and indirect interests of the related parties, the benefits\nof the transaction to us and whether any alternative transactions are available. To identify related-party transactions in advance, we rely on information supplied by our\nexecutive officers, directors and certain significant shareholders. In considering related-party transactions, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee takes into\naccount the relevant available facts and circumstances including, but not limited to:\n● whether the transaction was undertaken in the ordinary course of our business;\n● whether the related party transaction was initiated by us or the related party;\n● whether the transaction with the related party is proposed to be, or was, entered into on terms no less favorable to us than terms that could have been reached with an\nunrelated third party;\n● the purpose of, and the potential benefits to us from the related party transaction;\n● the approximate dollar value of the amount involved in the related party transaction, particularly as it relates to the related party;\n● the related party’s interest in the related party transaction, and\n● any other information regarding the related party transaction or the related party that would be material to investors in light of the circumstances of the particular\ntransaction.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall then make a recommendation to the Board, which will determine whether or not to approve of the related party\ntransaction, and if so, upon what terms and conditions.

Our reputation for integrity\nand excellence requires careful observance of the spirit and letter of all applicable laws and regulations, as well as the highest regard for standards of conduct and personal\nintegrity.\nThe continued success of AgriFORCE™ is dependent upon our customers’ trust and we are dedicated to preserving that trust. Employees owe a duty to AgriFORCE™ and its\ncustomers to act in a way that will merit the continued trust and confidence of our customers and the public in general.\nAgriFORCE™ will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and expects its directors, officers, and employees to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit,\nand intent of all relevant laws and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct.\nIn general, the use of common sense and good judgment, together with our core values, will guide you with respect to lines of acceptable conduct. If a situation arises where it\nis difficult to determine the proper course of action, the matter should be discussed openly with your immediate supervisor, a member of senior management, or Human\nResources for advice and consultation, if necessary.\nCompliance with this policy of business ethics and conduct is the responsibility of every AgriFORCE™ employee. Disregarding or failing to comply with this standard of\nbusiness ethics and conduct may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\nEmployees must report violations of this policy, or any of the policies in the Business Ethics section, to their immediate supervisor, a member of senior management, or Human\nResources.\n2.2 Employment Equity\nAgriFORCE™ is committed to providing equal employment opportunity for all employees and applicants for employment. The company does not discriminate in employment\nopportunities or practices on the basis of race, colour, religion, sex, marital status, family status, age, place of origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, political\nbelief, sexual orientation, or any other grounds protected by the laws or regulations of any jurisdiction in which we operate. We base all employment decisions – including\nrecruitment, selection, training, compensation, benefits, discipline, promotions, transfers, terminations, and social/recreational programs – on merit and the principles of equal\nemployment opportunity.\nOur employees have diverse backgrounds, skills and ideas that collectively contribute to greater opportunities for innovation. Our recruitment strategy is designed to attract a\ndiverse pool of talent so that we may select the best candidates and open doors at all levels of this organization.\n2.3 Conflict of Interest\nEveryone working at AgriFORCE™ has an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest. This policy establishes the\nframework within which AgriFORCE™ wishes the company to operate. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide general direction so that team members can seek further\nclarification on issues regarding conflict of interest.\nAn actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when someone on the team is able to influence a decision that may result in a personal gain for that individual or for a relative\nbecause of AgriFORCE™’s business dealings. For the purposes of this policy, a relative is any person who is related by blood or marriage or whose relationship with anyone\nworking in the company is like that of persons who are related by blood or marriage.\nIf an employee has any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative that they disclose to their supervisor, as soon as possible the existence\nof any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all parties.\nPersonal gain may result not only in cases where an employee or relative has a significant ownership or other interests in a business with which AgriFORCE™ does business,\nbut also when an employee or relative receives any kickback, bribe, substantial gift, or special consideration as a result of any transaction or business dealings involving\nAgriFORCE™.\n2.4 Gifts\nAgriFORCE™ employees (or immediate family members) are not permitted to give or accept gifts, services, discounts, favours, loans personal discounts and similar gratuities\noffered to you because of your position at AgriFORCE™. This applies to or from individuals or companies who are doing business or would like to do business with\nAgriFORCE™. Items of modest value may be permitted if they are not given or received on a regular or frequent basis, provided that the gift is reported to the CEO or the\nChair of the Audit Committee and they do not advise that retaining the gift would be inappropriate. This does not apply to officially approved corporate rebates.\n2.5 Entertainment\nYou must not encourage or solicit entertainment from any individual or company with whom AgriFORCE™ does business. Entertainment includes, but is not limited to,\nactivities such as dining, attending sporting or other special events, and travel. From time-to-time employees may accept unsolicited entertainment, but only under the following\nconditions:\n1. the entertainment occurs infrequently,\n2. it arises out of the ordinary course of business,\n3. it involves reasonable expenditures (the amounts involved should be such as employees, officers and Directors are accustomed to normally spending for their own\nbusiness or personal entertainment) and\n4. the entertainment takes place in settings that also are reasonable, appropriate, and fitting to employees, officers and Directors, their hosts, and their business at\nhand.\n2.6 Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption\nPart of behaving ethically means that you should never participate in any corrupt activities and that you comply with all applicable Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption laws and\nregulations of each jurisdiction in which AgriFORCE™ conducts business. AgriFORCE™ does not permit providing payments, kickbacks, gifts, or anything else of significant\nvalue for the purpose of improperly influencing third parties. Even if the intent is not to influence, you should not provide a payment or benefit to any third party if it could\nappear to be improper.\nAgriFORCE™ can be held responsible for improper payments and benefits provided by agents, contractors, suppliers and other third parties acting on its behalf. You must\nensure that you only deal with legitimate, reputable parties, and that they understand their obligation not to provide such improper payments or benefits in connection with the\nbusiness they conduct for AgriFORCE™.\n2.7 Confidentiality\nAll employees are required to keep all AgriFORCE™’s financial, operational and business information acquired while working at AgriFORCE™; secure and confidential.\nBusiness strategies and plans, including technologies and products used, are AgriFORCE™ intellectual property. Employees must not discuss details of AgriFORCE™’s\nfinancial, business operations, plans or strategies with any third party including the media, family or friends, or at social or public functions, and should direct all inquiries to\nthe CFO. Any employee who divulges confidential information may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n2.8 Disclosure, Confidentiality, and Insider Trading\nAt times you may find that you are in possession of material non-public information regarding AgriFORCE™ and/or a competitor or supplier. Material non-public information\nis any information that could reasonably be expected to alter the value of a company’s security (ies) if it were made public. Securities laws in both Canada and the United States\nprovide that it is illegal to trade on such information or disclose it to others. These laws are extensive and complex, and violation of these laws may lead to civil and criminal\nactions against you.\nIf you find yourself in possession of such information, you and your immediate family members are prohibited from trading in those securities until such time as the\ninformation becomes public or you are notified by your manager that restrictions are no longer in place.\nThe purchase and sale of AgriFORCE™ securities may only be done in accordance with the AgriFORCE™ Insider Trading Policy. The Policy also addresses legal prohibitions\nagainst trading with knowledge of undisclosed material information, tipping, market manipulation or fraud and insider trade reporting requirements. Violations of such\nrequirements may also have severe consequences, including fines, imprisonment and civil liability and may subject the individual to disciplinary action by the Corporation, up\nto and including termination. Employees, Officers, and Directors who engage in insider trading may also be accountable to AgriFORCE™ for any benefit or advantage received\nas a result.\nPlease refer to the AgriFORCE™ Insider Trading Policy provided as an Appendix to this Handbook for more detailed information on this subject. The AgriFORCE™ Insider\nTrading Policy requires your signature separate from the Handbook Acknowledgement.\n2.9 Whistleblower Policy\nEmployees are often the first to have concerns that there may be something wrong or unethical occurring within the organisation in which they work. However, they may feel\nthat their concerns cannot be openly expressed, because it may be disloyal to colleagues; their concerns may not be taken seriously; or it may be easier to ignore their concern.\nAs a means of reinforcing AgriFORCE™’s commitment to the highest standards, this ‘Whistle-blowing Procedure’ serves to help build the commitment of all employees, by\nproviding a means of identifying and eliminating unethical practices within the workplace. The ‘Whistle-blowing Procedure’ provides an effective mechanism for employees to\nreport potential concerns (confidentially and anonymously, if required), in the knowledge that genuine concerns will be appropriately investigated and resolved, without fear of\ndiscrimination or victimisation.\nPlease refer to the separate Whistleblower Policy document for more detail.\n2.10 Anti-Retaliation Provisions\nRetaliation against any employee, who in good faith seeks advice, raises a concern, reports misconduct, or provides information in an investigation will not be tolerated and will\nitself be considered a violation of AgriFORCE™ Business Ethics. Some examples of retaliation include denial of benefits, termination, demotion, suspension, threats,\nharassment, or discrimination. If any individual retaliates against an employee who has truthfully and in good faith reported a potential violation, AgriFORCE™ will take\nappropriate action. However, if an individual has intentionally made a false report, the Company will respond accordingly. For more details, please refer to the AgriFORCE™\nWhistleblower Policy.\nIf you believe that you or another employee has been retaliated against for (in good faith) seeking advice, raising a concern, reporting misconduct, or providing information in\nan investigation, please advise your immediate manager, Human Resources, the AgriFORCE™ CEO or the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the AgriFORCE™ Board. All\nreports will be handled promptly and confidentially.\n2.11 Outside Employment\nWhile not encouraged, should employees wish to engage in outside employment, in addition to their full-time position at AgriFORCE™, we request that:\n● such outside employment does not interfere in any way with the employee’s work performance or hours of employment with the Company;\n● such employment is non-competitive with the business activities of the Company; and\n● such employment has no possible conflict of interest with the employee’s position at the Company.\nAll employees are reminded that they have signed an agreement which legally prohibits them from passing on the Company’s ideas and work methods to other organizations.\nEmployees may not use Company property, equipment, facilities, or time in connection with outside employment.\nIf it is deemed that, because of outside employment, an employee is repeatedly late, unable to work overtime, or unable to successfully fulfill the obligations of their position at\nAgriFORCE™, it may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n2.12 Off Duty Conduct Policy\nIn general, how employees decide to lead their lives when they are off duty is a private matter. However, the way in which employees conduct and present themselves off-duty\ncan also have a significant impact on AgriFORCE™ its business, reputation, products, customer relations and workplace environment. Accordingly, while the Company\nrespects your personal freedoms, it also has a legitimate interest in establishing standards of off duty conduct and holding workers accountable for following those standards,\nincluding using discipline where necessary.\nOff-duty conduct will be considered a work-related matter subject to discipline if it:\n● harms the Company’s reputation or products;\n● has consequences that render you unable to perform your job or any part of your job effectively;\n● leads other workers to refuse, be reluctant to or unable to work with you;\n● makes you guilty of a serious breach of the Criminal Code of Canada/Title 18 of the United States Code or;\n● makes it difficult for the Company to manage its operations and/or direct its workforce efficiently.\nViolations of the Company’s off-duty standards of conduct that meet the above criteria will be treated like a disciplinary infraction committed on-duty and subject to discipline\nup to and including termination.\nYou must report to your supervisor as soon as possible if you are arrested, detained, or charged with a violation under the Criminal Code of Canada/Title 18 of the United States\nCode or other Canadian/US laws related to your official duties.\n2.13 Board Participation and Involvement with Other Companies\nFor any employee who wishes to participate on a for-profit, or not-for-profit board, these involvements must be approved by the CEO. All Directors should notify the Chair of\nthe Audit Committee of all other board engagements and seek approval before assuming additional Board roles. You may not be a Director, officer, partner or consultant of an\norganization (other than an organization in which AgriFORCE™ holds an interest or in which AgriFORCE™ has the right to nominate a Director, officer, partner or consultant)\ndoing or seeking to do business with AgriFORCE™, nor may you permit your name to be used in any way indicating a business connection with such an organization, without\nappropriate prior written approval of the AgriFORCE™ CEO, in the case of an employee, and of the Chair of the Governance and Nominating Committee in the case of an\nofficer or Director of AgriFORCE™.\n2.14 AgriFORCE™ Property\nEmployees are responsible for and are expected to take proper care of all AgriFORCE™ property, materials, or written information issued to them or in their possession or\ncontrol.\nUpon request of the Company or upon termination or expiration of employment, the employee will turn over to the Company all property belonging to the Company including\nall confidential information belonging to the Company, including but not limited to, all documents, plans, specifications, disks, or other computer media, as well as any\nduplicates or backups made of that Confidential Information in whatever form or media, in the possession or control of the employee that:\n● may contain or be derived from ideas, concepts, creations, or trade secrets and other proprietary and confidential information; or\n● is connected with or derived from the employee’s employment with AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd.\n2.15 Copyright and Protection of Intellectual Property\nEmployees are not entitled to any copyright or moral right in or arising from any work they produce in the course of their employment with AgriFORCE™.

Destruction of records can only take place if they are not required for any pending legal matters. If you are unclear on what documents may be discarded, contact\ncompany legal counsel, or speak to your manager.\n2.17 Non-Solicitation\nDuring the employee’s term of employment with AgriFORCE™ and for a period of twelve (12) months after the end of that term, the employee will not in any way, directly or\nindirectly:\n● induce or attempt to induce any employee or contractor of the Employer to quit employment or retainer with AgriFORCE™;\n● otherwise interfere with or disrupt AgriFORCE™’s relationship with its employees and contractors;\n● discuss employment opportunities or provide information about competitive employment to any of AgriFORCE™’s employees or contractors; or\n● solicit, entice, or hire away any employee or contractor of AgriFORCE™ for the purpose of an employment opportunity that is in competition with AgriFORCE™.\nThis non-solicitation obligation as described above will be limited to employees or contractors who were employees or contractors of AgriFORCE™ during the period that the\nemployee was employed by AgriFORCE™.\nDuring the term of the employee’s active employment with AgriFORCE™, and for one (1) year thereafter, the employee will not divert or attempt to divert from AgriFORCE™\nany business AgriFORCE™ had enjoyed, solicited, or attempted to solicit, from its customers, prior to termination or expiration, as the case may be, of the employee’s\nemployment with AgriFORCE™.\n2.18 Contract Binding Authority\nUnless authorized in writing by AgriFORCE™, employees do not have the authority to enter any contracts or commitments for or on the behalf of the Company.

Before making\nthis determination, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, documented such attempt(s) and provided such\ndocumentation to Nasdaq; and\n2.4.Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the\nrequirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder.\n3.
