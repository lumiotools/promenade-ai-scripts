Reports Fiscal 2025 First Quarter Results\n\nNovember 6, 2024 at 7:30 AM EST\n\nVONORE, Tenn., Nov. 06, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MCFT) today announced financial results for its fiscal 2025 first quarter ended September 29, 2024.\n\nThe overview, commentary, and results provided herein relate to our continuing operations, which exclude our former Aviara segment.\n\n**Overview:**\n\n  * Net sales for the first quarter were $65.4 million, down $28.9 million, or 30.7%, from the prior-year period\n  * Income from continuing operations was $1.0 million, or $0.06 per diluted share\n  * Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.9 million, or $0.12 per diluted share\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $3.8 million, down $10.2 million from the prior-year period\n  * Share repurchases of $3.5 million during the quarter\n\n\n\nBrad Nelson, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our business executed well during the first quarter as we delivered results above expectations despite facing a backdrop of continued economic and industry headwinds. Our strong quarter was led by significant progress rebalancing dealer inventories and sets a strong foundation for the rest of the fiscal year. With the summer selling season now complete, we are focused on shipping our enhanced product ahead of the boat show season, while we continue to carefully manage dealer health.”\n\nNelson continued, “We maintain a disciplined approach to capital allocation as we prioritize balance sheet resilience throughout the business cycle. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation is a significant advantage which provides us with abundant financial flexibility. We are well positioned to pursue our capital allocation priorities, including targeted investment in long-term growth through focused innovation, product, and brand development.”\n\nOn August 8, 2024, we announced that we had entered into an asset purchase agreement, pursuant to which we will transfer rights to the Aviara brand of luxury dayboats and certain related assets to a subsidiary of MarineMax, Inc. The transaction was completed on October 18, 2024. Additionally, on September 12, 2024, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell our Aviara manufacturing facility for $26.5 million. The transaction is expected to be completed in our fiscal 2025 second quarter. The Company has reported the results of operations for its Aviara segment as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated statement of operations and the related assets and liabilities held-for-sale are classified as held-for-sale in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\nOn September 27, 2024, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement to obtain the necessary consents and waivers to the restrictions in the covenants of the Credit Agreement, as related to the Aviara transaction and plans to sell certain facility assets, and a waiver to the fixed charge covenant ratio for certain periods. In conjunction with the amendment, the Company drew $49.5 million on its Revolving Credit Facility, leaving $50.5 million of available borrowing capacity.\n\n**First Quarter Results**\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2025, MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. reported consolidated net sales of $65.4 million, down $28.9 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower unit volumes and unfavorable model mix, as expected.\n\nGross margin percentage declined 570 basis points during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the prior-year period. Lower margins were the result of lower cost absorption due to planned decreased production volume and higher dealer incentives as a percentage of net sales. Dealer incentives include measures taken by the Company to assist dealers as the retail environment remains very competitive.\n\nOperating expenses decreased $1.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the prior-year period. The decrease in operating expenses was a result of lower share-based compensation expense and lower professional fees.\n\nIncome from continuing operations was $1.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to $8.5 million in the prior-year period. Diluted income from continuing operations per share was $0.06, compared to $0.50 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nAdjusted Net income was $1.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to $10.3 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $3.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to $14.0 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.9% for the first quarter, down from 14.9% for the prior-year period.\n\nSee “Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per share, which we refer to collectively as the “Non-GAAP Measures”, to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Outlook**\n\nConcluded Nelson, “Given the incremental retail visibility and progress reducing field inventories during the quarter, we are raising the lower end of our full year guidance. We are encouraged by recent industry and economic developments, including easing interest rates, which could commence a return to a more normalized environment by catalyzing wholesale and retail demand for recreational boats. We will continue to monitor retail results, dealer sentiment, and broader economic conditions closely and are well-equipped to adjust our production plans for a range of scenarios.”\n\nThe Company’s outlook is as follows:\n\n  * For full year fiscal 2025, we now expect consolidated net sales to be between $270 million and $300 million, with Adjusted EBITDA between $17 million and $26 million, and Adjusted Earnings per share of between $0.55 and $0.95. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $12 million for the full year.\n  * For fiscal second quarter 2025, consolidated net sales are expected to be approximately $60 million, with Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 million, and Adjusted Loss per share of approximately $(0.01).\n\n\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nMasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. will host a live conference call and webcast to discuss fiscal first quarter 2025 results today, November 6, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. EST.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations. For the periods presented herein, the adjustments include share-based compensation, and CEO transition and organizational realignment costs. We define EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, each expressed as a percentage of Net sales.\n\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share\n\nWe define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share as income from continuing operations, adjusted to eliminate certain non-cash charges or other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and reflecting income tax expense on adjusted net income before income taxes at our estimated annual effective tax rate. For the periods presented herein, these adjustments include other intangible asset amortization, share-based compensation, and CEO transition and organizational realignment costs.\n\nThe Non-GAAP Measures are not measures of net income or operating income as determined under GAAP. The Non-GAAP Measures are not measures of performance in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income per share, or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of cash flow. We believe that the inclusion of the Non-GAAP Measures is appropriate to provide additional information to investors because securities analysts and investors use the Non-GAAP Measures to assess our operating performance across periods on a consistent basis and to evaluate the relative risk of an investment in our securities. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period that, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than does GAAP measures alone. We believe Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share assists our board of directors, management, investors, and other users of the financial statements in comparing our net income on a consistent basis from period to period because it removes certain non-cash items and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations and reflecting income tax expense on adjusted net income before income taxes at our estimated annual effective tax rate. The Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\n  * Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and the Non-GAAP Measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;\n  * The Non-GAAP Measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n  * The Non-GAAP Measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n  * Certain Non-GAAP Measures do not reflect our tax expense or any cash requirements to pay income taxes;\n  * Certain Non-GAAP Measures do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness; and\n  * The Non-GAAP Measures do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our core and/or ongoing operations, but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations.\n\n\n\nIn addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry.\n\nWe do not provide forward-looking guidance for certain financial measures on a GAAP basis because we are unable to predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. These items may include acquisition-related costs, litigation charges or settlements, impairment charges, and certain other unusual adjustments.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of income from continuing operations as determined in accordance with GAAP to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, and income from continuing operations margin to EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin (each expressed as a percentage of net sales) for the periods indicated:\n\n(Dollars in thousands) | **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 29 ,** | **% of Net** | **October 1 ,** | **% of Net**  \n**2024** | **sales** | **2023** | **sales**  \n**Income from continuing operations** | $ | 1,016 | 1.6% | $ | 8,531 | 9.0%  \nIncome tax expense | 193 | 2,496  \nInterest expense | 987 | 878  \nInterest income | (1,192 | ) | (1,352 | )  \nDepreciation and amortization | 2,074 | 2,109  \n**EBITDA** | 3,078 | 4.7% | 12,662 | 13.4%  \nShare-based compensation | 430 | 910  \nCEO transition and organizational realignment costs(a) | 334 | 436  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** | $ | 3,842 | 5.9% | $ | 14,008 | 14.9%  \n  \nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of income from continuing operations as determined in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted Net Income for the periods indicated:\n\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) | **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 29 ,** | **October 1 ,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**Income from continuing operations** | $ | 1,016 | $ | 8,531  \nIncome tax expense | 193 | 2,496  \nAmortization of acquisition intangibles | 450 | 462  \nShare-based compensation | 430 | 910  \nCEO transition and organizational realignment costs(a) | 334 | 436  \nAdjusted Net Income before income taxes | 2,423 | 12,835  \nAdjusted income tax expense(b) | 485 | 2,567  \n**Adjusted Net Income** | $ | 1,938 | $ | 10,268  \nAdjusted net income per common share  \nBasic | $ | 0.12 | $ | 0.60  \nDiluted | $ | 0.12 | $ | 0.60  \nWeighted average shares used for the computation of (c):  \nBasic Adjusted net income per share | 16,544,941 | 17,156,283  \nDiluted Adjusted net income per share | 16,544,941 | 17,224,608  \n  \nThe following table presents the reconciliation of income from continuing operations per diluted share to Adjusted Net Income per diluted share for the periods indicated:\n\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) | **Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 29 ,** | **October 1 ,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**Income from continuing operations per diluted share** | $ | 0.06 | $ | 0.50  \nImpact of adjustments:  \nIncome tax expense | 0.01 | 0.14  \nAmortization of acquisition intangibles | 0.03 | 0.03  \nShare-based compensation | 0.03 | 0.05  \nCEO transition and organizational realignment costs(a) | 0.02 | 0.03  \nAdjusted Net Income per diluted share before income taxes | 0.15 | 0.75  \nImpact of adjusted income tax expense on net income per diluted share before income taxes(b) | (0.03 | ) | (0.15 | )  \n**Adjusted Net Income per diluted share** | $ | 0.12 | $ | 0.60  \n  \n  1.

The all-day event provided a structured experience for nearly 170 attendees, with stations focused on product education, company history, pricing strategies, product development, marketing insights, and a comprehensive tour of the factory. The highlight of the day was the unveiling of an exciting new product, signaling the start of an innovative new chapter for the brand.\n\nTo cap off the event, dealers gathered for a celebratory banquet that emphasized the camaraderie, resilience, and renewed energy within the MasterCraft family. “This meeting marks significant milestones for our brand: a new CEO, a new product, and a relatively new leadership team in Sales, Marketing, and Engineering. But just as importantly, we are surrounded by individuals who have dedicated decades to MasterCraft, embodying its spirit and contributing their passion and expertise year after year,” said Brad Nelson, MasterCraft Boat Chief Executive Officer and Director of MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc., in his keynote address. Nelson also emphasized MasterCraft’s continued commitment to innovation and strengthening relationships with its dealer network.\n\n**Honoring Excellence and Legacy** During the banquet, more than 50 prestigious awards were presented, including two lifetime service awards. The evening’s pinnacle moment came with the induction of legendary waterskiing icon Freddy Krueger into the MasterCraft Legends Club, MasterCraft’s hall of fame. The Legends Club honors athletes and ambassadors who have played a pivotal role in the brand’s success and embody its spirit. Freddy Krueger joins an elite group of only five members, celebrated for their profound impact on the sport, the brand, and the entire MasterCraft community.\n\nThe event also celebrated 28 dealers who achieved perfect scores on their Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) surveys, underscoring the dealer network’s commitment to providing outstanding customer experiences throughout the year.\n\nAdditional awards were presented for excellence in marketing, sales, and service for the West, South, Northeast, Midwest and International territories.\n\n**\"We Build Memories\" Campaign** At the heart of the event was an emphasis of MasterCraft’s new “We Build Memories” campaign, which serves as a reminder of the core mission behind the boats MasterCraft builds and sells. “Our boats are more than just products—they are the foundation for unforgettable moments with family and friends. Our owners create memories that last a lifetime, and those moments are woven into the fabric of their lives,” said Nelson.\n\n**Advancing into a New Era** The event was a celebration of MasterCraft’s deep legacy, but also a platform for showcasing the exciting changes on the horizon. With a new leadership, MasterCraft is doubling down on its commitment to progression, innovation, and excellence across every level of the company. Nelson reinforced this vision in his speech, stating, “We are focused on delivering high performance from the factory and deepening our relationships with our dealers as true partners in this journey.” At the meeting, attendees were introduced to a range of new innovations and upcoming products. They participated in on-water sessions to gain firsthand experience with the new products and ensure they are equipped to continue supporting MasterCraft’s vision.\n\n“For over 20 years, I have had the pleasure of being associated with the brand MasterCraft, first as an athlete, then as a dealer, and now as a distributor. I must say that these past few days have been truly remarkable; I've felt so much positive energy within MasterCraft,” said Fred Traeger, a Dealer and International Distributor of MasterCraft in Switzerland. “The new team, along with some who have been around longer, are dynamic, motivated, and full of incredible energy. Their dedication is felt at every moment, and I am convinced that this synergy is a major asset for the brand's future,” Traeger said.\n\nJathan Koetje from Action Water Sports echoed this sentiment, saying, “Our team left MasterCraft’s annual dealer meeting energized and excited about what’s to come.” He added, “The opportunity to connect with other dealers and the MasterCraft team reinforced the strong sense of community and innovation that fuels the brand.”\n\nThe dealer meeting was met with gratitude, excitement, and renewed energy, underscoring MasterCraft’s unwavering commitment to its dealer network and its future. The event not only highlighted the company’s rich heritage but also set the tone for the next era of innovation, growth, and lasting impact.\n\n**About MasterCraft:** MasterCraft is a world-renowned innovator, designer, manufacturer, and marketer of premium performance sport boats.
