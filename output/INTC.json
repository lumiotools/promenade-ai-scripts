(Credit: Intel Corporation)\n\n“With Intel 3 already in high-volume production and Intel 18A set to follow next year, leading-edge semiconductors are once again being made on American soil,” said Pat Gelsinger, CEO of Intel. “Strong bipartisan support for restoring American technology and manufacturing leadership is driving historic investments that are critical to the country’s long-term economic growth and national security. Intel is deeply committed to advancing these shared priorities as we further expand our U.S. operations over the next several years.” \n\nThe announcement demonstrates the U.S. government’s confidence in Intel’s essential role in building a resilient, trusted semiconductor supply chain on domestic soil. Since the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act more than two years ago, Intel has announced plans to invest more than $100 billion in the U.S. to expand chipmaking and advanced packaging capacity and capabilities critical to economic and national security. The historic investments will support tens of thousands of jobs, strengthen U.S. supply chains, foster U.S.-based R&D, and help ensure American leadership in cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing and technology capabilities. \n\n“The CHIPS for America program will supercharge American technology and innovation and make our country more secure – and Intel is expected to play an important role in the revitalization of the U.S. semiconductor industry,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “Thanks to the leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris, our CHIPS award is catalyzing Intel to make one of the largest investments in semiconductor manufacturing in U.S. history.” \n\n**Press Kit:** [U.S. CHIPS Act Funding for Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/resources/us-chips-act-funding-intel.html)\n\nThe award follows the previously signed preliminary memorandum of terms and the completion of Commerce’s due diligence, in addition to the announced investment tax credit. The final total award is less than the proposed preliminary award due to a congressional requirement to use CHIPS funding to pay for the $3 billion Secure Enclave program. \n\n**U.S. Manufacturing and R &D Investments**\n\nThe CHIPS Act award will directly support Intel’s investments at sites where the company develops and produces many of the world’s most advanced chips and semiconductor packaging technologies, including in Arizona, the Silicon Desert; New Mexico, the Silicon Mesa; Ohio, the Silicon Heartland; and Oregon, the Silicon Forest. \n\n  * [Arizona: Intel’s U.S. Manufacturing Powerhouse](https://download.intel.com/newsroom/2024/corporate/Intel-Arizona-The-Silicon-desert.pdf) (Silicon Desert Fact Sheet) \n  * [New Mexico: Intel’s U.S. Advanced Packaging Site](https://download.intel.com/newsroom/2024/corporate/Intel-New-Mexico-The-Silicon-Mesa.pdf) (Silicon Mesa Fact Sheet) \n  * [Ohio: Intel’s New Leading-Edge Manufacturing Site](https://download.intel.com/newsroom/2024/corporate/Intel-Ohio-The-Silicon-Heartland.pdf) (Silicon Heartland Fact Sheet) \n  * [Oregon: The Heart of Intel’s Semiconductor R&D](https://download.intel.com/newsroom/2024/corporate/Intel-Oregon-The-Silicon-Forest.pdf) (Silicon Forest Fact Sheet) \n\n\n\nIntel was founded in the U.S. and has been innovating, investing and supporting global semiconductor manufacturing and R&D for more than 50 years. Intel currently employs approximately 45,000 people in the U.S. \n\n**Foundry Momentum and Technology Leadership**\n\nIntel is nearing completion of a historic pace of semiconductor node development to regain process technology leadership. Intel 18A, the company’s fifth process node in four years, is on track to launch in 2025 and continues to gain traction with customers. The company is finalizing a multiyear, multibillion-dollar [commitment by Amazon Web Services](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-strategic-collaboration.html) to expand its existing partnership to include a new custom Intel® Xeon® 6 chip on Intel 3 and a new AI fabric chip on Intel 18A. \n\nIn September 2024, Intel won a manufacturing contract for up to $3 billion for the [Secure Enclave](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/2024-intel-news.html) program. This program is designed to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the U.S. government and builds on Intel’s relationship with the U.S. Department of Defense through the Rapid Assured Microelectronics Prototypes - Commercial (RAMP-C) and State-of-the-Art Heterogeneous Integrated Packaging (SHIP) programs. \n\nAdditionally, Intel [reported key milestones](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-foundry-opens-new-frontier-chipmaking.html) in advanced semiconductor manufacturing with the completed assembly of the industry’s first commercial High Numerical Aperture (High NA) Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography scanner and receipt of an additional High NA tool installed at the company’s Hillsboro, Oregon, R&D site. This will enable Intel to lead cutting-edge advancements that will define next-generation chip manufacturing. \n\n**Workforce Development and Childcare Benefits**\n\nAlongside its manufacturing and technology investments, Intel has a long-standing history of investing in the American workforce by supporting education, training and benefits programs needed to create the jobs of the future. In 2022, for example, Intel announced a [$100 million investment](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-invests-100m-ohio-national-education.html) to expand semiconductor education, research and workforce training opportunities across the nation. \n\nAs part of Intel’s overall CHIPS award, $65 million is set aside to support the company’s efforts to create a more skilled semiconductor workforce. Intel plans to use $56 million to help train students and faculty at all education levels to support industry growth. This includes, for example, Intel’s recently launched [U.S. registered apprenticeship program](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intels-first-us-apprenticeship-for-manufacturing-technicians.html) for manufacturing facility technicians. \n\nThe company will use $5 million of the dedicated workforce award to help increase childcare availability near Intel’s facilities. This is intended to support Intel’s recently announced plans to [broaden childcare benefits](https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Intel/Policy-Intel/Intel-s-Family-Focused-Future-Expanding-Childcare-Benefits-to/post/1613022) and pilot innovative programs to support working families. The remaining $4 million of the $65 million award will support Intel’s participation in the [CHIPS Women in Construction Framework](https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Intel/Policy-Intel/Intel-s-Commitment-to-Expanding-the-Number-of-Women-in/post/1605785), which Intel voluntarily committed to this year to help expand the construction workforce by increasing the participation of women and economically disadvantaged individuals. \n\nFinally, [Intel is partnering](https://mmeconsortium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MMEC_ProjectAwards_2024.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_source=sharpspring) with the Midwest Microelectronics Consortium (MMEC) as its members receive funding for five technology development projects within the Microelectronics Commons initiative established under the CHIPS Act. These projects will engage more than 30 MMEC members representing organizations from industry, academia and government stakeholders to advance domestic microelectronic technology development to deliver solutions to strengthen the U.S.-based supply chain. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

We delivered revenue above the midpoint of our guidance, and are acting with urgency to position the business for sustainable value creation moving forward,” said Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO. “The momentum we are building across our product portfolio to maximize the value of our x86 franchise, combined with the strong interest Intel 18A is attracting from foundry customers, reflects the impact of our actions and the opportunities ahead.” \n\n“Restructuring charges meaningfully impacted Q3 profitability as we took important steps toward our cost reduction goal,” said David Zinsner, Intel CFO. “The actions we took this quarter position us for improved profitability and enhanced liquidity as we continue to execute our strategy. We are encouraged by improved underlying trends, reflected in our Q4 guidance.” \n\nQ3 2024 Financial Highlights\n\n**GAAP** |  **Non-GAAP**  \n---|---  \n**Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023** |  **vs. Q3 2023** |  **Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023** |  **vs. Q3 2023**  \nRevenue ($B)  |  $13.3  |  $14.2  |  down 6%   \nGross Margin  |  15.0%  |  42.5%  |  down 27.5 ppts  |  18.0%  |  45.8%  |  down 27.8 ppts   \nR&D and MG&A ($B)  |  $5.4  |  $5.2  |  up 4%  |  $4.8  |  $4.6  |  up 4%   \nOperating Margin  |  (68.2)%  |  (0.1)%  |  down 68.1 ppts  |  (17.8)%  |  13.6%  |  down 31.4 ppts   \nTax Rate  |  (87.0)%  |  696.2%  |  n/m*  |  13.0%  |  13.0%  |  —   \nNet Income (loss) Attributable to Intel ($B)  |  $(16.6)  |  $0.3  |  n/m*  |  $(2.0)  |  $1.7  |  n/m*   \nEarnings (loss) Per Share Attributable to Intel  |  $(3.88)  |  $0.07  |  n/m*  |  $(0.46)  |  $0.41  |  n/m*   \n  \nIn the third quarter, the company generated $4.1 billion in cash from operations and paid dividends of $0.5 billion. \n\n_*Not meaningful_\n\nQ3 2024 Restructuring and Impairment Charges\n\nIn the third quarter, the company made significant progress on its $10 billion cost reduction plan. The plan aims to drive operational efficiency and agility, accelerate profitable growth and create capacity for ongoing strategic investment in technology and manufacturing leadership. These initiatives include structural and operating realignment across the company, alongside reductions in headcount, operating expenses and capital expenditures. As a result of these actions, the company recognized $2.8 billion in restructuring charges in Q3 2024, $528 million of which are non-cash charges and $2.2 billion of which will be cash settled in the future. \n\nIntel's third quarter results were also materially impacted by the following charges: \n\n  * $3.1 billion of charges, substantially all of which were recognized in cost of sales, related to non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to the Intel 7 process node, based upon an evaluation of current process technology node capacities relative to projected market demand for Intel products and services; \n  * $2.9 billion of non-cash charges associated with the impairment of goodwill for certain reporting units – primarily the Mobileye reporting unit – as well as certain acquired intangible assets; and \n  * $9.9 billion of non-cash charges related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets. \n\n\n\nThe restructuring charges of $2.8 billion and the asset impairment charges, including the allowance against our deferred tax assets, and accelerated depreciation of $15.9 billion increased GAAP loss per share attributable to Intel by $3.89. The restructuring charges, impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, and deferred tax asset valuation allowance had no impact on non-GAAP loss per share attributable to Intel. The impairment charges and accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets of $3.1 billion increased GAAP and non-GAAP loss per share attributable to Intel by $0.57 and $0.63 per share, respectively. These charges were not incorporated into the guidance Intel provided for the third quarter of 2024. \n\nBusiness Unit Summary\n\nIn October 2022, Intel announced an internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024 and created a foundry relationship between its Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCAI and NEX) and its Intel Foundry business (including Foundry Technology Development, Foundry Manufacturing and Supply Chain and Foundry Services, formerly IFS). The foundry operating model is designed to reshape operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. In furtherance of Intel's internal foundry operating model, Intel announced in the third quarter of 2024 its intent to establish Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. The company also previously announced its intent to operate Altera® as a standalone business beginning in the first quarter of 2024. Altera was previously included in DCAI's segment results. As a result of these changes, the company modified its segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way the company internally receives information and manages and monitors its operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2024. There are no changes to Intel’s consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. \n\n**Business Unit Revenue and Trends** |  **Q3 2024** |  **vs. Q3 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nIntel Products:   \nClient Computing Group (CCG)  |  $7.3 billion  |  down  |  7%   \nData Center and AI (DCAI)  |  $3.3 billion  |  up  |  9%   \nNetwork and Edge (NEX)  |  $1.5 billion  |  up  |  4%   \nTotal Intel Products revenue  |  $12.2 billion  |  down  |  2%   \nIntel Foundry  |  $4.4 billion  |  down  |  8%   \nAll other:   \nAltera  |  $412 million  |  down  |  44%   \nMobileye  |  $485 million  |  down  |  8%   \nOther  |  $142 million  |  down  |  24%   \nTotal all other revenue  |  $1,039 million  |  down  |  28%   \nIntersegment eliminations  |  $(4.3) billion   \nTotal net revenue  |  $13.3 billion  |  down  |  6%   \n  \n**Intel Products Highlights**\n\n  * Intel announced plans with AMD to create the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group, bringing together leaders from across the industry to help shape the future of x86. The Ecosystem Advisory Group is focused on simplifying software development, ensuring interoperability and interface consistency across vendors and providing developers with standard architectural tools and instructions. Broadcom, Dell, Google, HPE, HP Inc., Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Red Hat have signed on as founding members. \n  * **CCG:** Intel continues to lead the AI PC category and is on track to ship more than 100 million AI PCs by the end of 2025. In September, Intel launched its Intel® Core™ Ultra 200V series processors, code-named Lunar Lake, delivering several more hours of battery life and gains in performance, graphics and AI. This month, Intel launched the new Intel® Core™ Ultra 200S processors, code-named Arrow Lake, that will scale AI PC capabilities to desktop platforms and usher in the first enthusiast desktop AI PCs. \n  * **DCAI:** Intel launched Intel® Xeon®, doubling the performance of the prior generation with increased core counts, memory bandwidth, and embedded AI acceleration. Intel also launched its Intel® Gaudi® 3 AI accelerators, delivering twice the networking bandwidth and 1.5x the memory bandwidth of its predecessor for large language model efficiency. IBM and Intel announced a global collaboration to deploy Intel Gaudi 3 AI accelerators as a service on IBM Cloud, aiming to help more cost-effectively scale enterprise AI and drive innovation underpinned with security and resiliency. \n  * **NEX:** Intel achieved a significant design win earlier this month with KDDI, a major global telecom, announcing its selection of Samsung's vRAN 3.0 solution powered by 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors with Intel vRAN Boost. \n\n\n\n**Intel Foundry Highlights**\n\n  * Intel’s fifth node in four years, Intel 18A, will complete a historic pace of design and process innovation, returning Intel to process leadership. Intel 18A is healthy and continues to progress well, and the company’s two lead products, Panther Lake for client and Clearwater Forest for servers, have met early Intel 18A milestones ahead of next year's launches. \n  * Intel and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are finalizing a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar commitment to expand the companies' existing partnership to include a new custom Xeon 6 chip for AWS on Intel 3 and a new AI fabric chip for AWS on Intel 18A. \n  * The Biden-Harris Administration announced that Intel was awarded up to $3 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS and Science Act for the Secure Enclave program. The program is designed to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the U.S. government and fortify the domestic semiconductor supply chain. \n  * Intel announced its intention to establish Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. This structure provides clearer separation for external foundry customers and suppliers between Intel Foundry and Intel Products. It also gives Intel future flexibility to evaluate independent sources of funding and optimize the capital structure of Intel Foundry and Intel Products. \n\n\n\nBusiness Outlook\n\nIntel's guidance for the fourth quarter of 2024 includes both GAAP and non-GAAP estimates as follows: \n\n**Q4 2024** |  **GAAP** |  **Non-GAAP**  \n---|---|---  \nRevenue  |  $13.3-14.3 billion   \nGross Margin  |  36.5%  |  39.5%   \nTax Rate  |  (50)%  |  13%   \nEarnings (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Intel—Diluted  |  $(0.24)  |  $0.12   \n  \nReconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included below. Actual results may differ materially from Intel’s business outlook as a result of, among other things, the factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below. The gross margin and EPS outlook are based on the mid-point of the revenue range. \n\nEarnings Webcast\n\nIntel will hold a public webcast at 2 p.m. PDT today to discuss the results for its third quarter of 2024.

\n\nIntel Corporation Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures \n\nIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans. \n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related effects to income taxes and net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests effects. Income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 13% across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on at least an annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Non-GAAP adjustments attributable to non-controlling interests are calculated by adjusting for the minority stockholder portion of non-GAAP adjustments we make for relevant acquisition-related costs, share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, and income tax effects, as applicable to each majority-owned subsidiary. \n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. \n\n**Non-GAAP adjustment or measure** |  **Definition** |  **Usefulness to management and investors**  \n---|---|---  \nAcquisition-related adjustments  |  Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years.  |  We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.   \nShare-based compensation  |  Share-based compensation consists of charges related to our employee equity incentive plans.  |  We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these adjustments provide comparability to peer company results and because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our core operating performance. We believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core business model, how management currently evaluates core operational performance, and additional means to evaluate expense trends, including in comparison to other peer companies.   \nRestructuring and other charges  |  Restructuring charges are costs associated with a restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements. Q3 2024 includes charges associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan primarily comprised of cash-based employee severance and benefit arrangements, and cash and non-cash charges related to real estate exits and consolidations, as well as non-cash construction in progress asset impairments resulting from business exit activities. Other charges include periodic goodwill and asset impairments, and other costs associated with certain non-core activities. Q3 2024 includes non-cash charges resulting from the impairment of goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets. Q3 2023 includes two legal related fees, which we do not expect to recur, relating to an EC-imposed fine and a termination fee relating to Tower.  |  We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our core operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.   \n(Gains) losses on equity investments, net  |  (Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists of ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable equity securities, observable price adjustments on non-marketable equity securities, related impairment charges, and the gains (losses) from the sale of equity investments and other.  |  We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because it provides comparability between periods. The exclusion reflects how management evaluates the core operations of the business.   \n(Gains) losses from divestiture  |  (Gains) losses are recognized at the close of a divestiture, or over a specified deferral period when deferred consideration is received at the time of closing. Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement entered into in connection with the first closing of the sale of our NAND memory business on December 29, 2021, a portion of the initial closing consideration was deferred and will be recognized between first and second closing.  |  We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because they do not reflect our current operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.   \nDeferred tax assets valuation allowances  |  A non-cash charge recorded to provision for (benefit from) income taxes related to a discreet valuation allowance recorded against our US deferred tax assets.  |  We excluded a discrete non-cash charge in Q3 2024 related to a valuation allowance established against our US deferred tax assets due to a historical cumulative loss for GAAP purposes. We excluded the discreet valuation allowance when calculating certain non-GAAP measures as there is no such historical cumulative loss on a non-GAAP basis; and because of the size of the charge, the adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of our core operating performance and comparisons to our past operating results.   \nAdjusted free cash flow  |  We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted free cash flow, which is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow adjusted for (1) purchases of property, plant, and equipment, including purchases where the vendor has extended payment terms to us, net of proceeds from capital-related government incentives and partner contributions, and (2) payments on finance leases.  |  This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in understanding our capital requirements and sources of liquidity by providing an additional means to evaluate the cash flow trends of our business.   \nNet capital spending  |  We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of net capital spending, which is additions to property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from capital-related government incentives and partner contributions.  |  We believe this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about our capital investment activities and capital offsets, and allows for greater transparency with respect to a key metric used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance.   \n  \nIntel Corporation Supplemental Reconciliations of GAAP Actuals to Non-GAAP Actuals \n\nSet forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure.

We delivered revenue above the midpoint of our\nguidance, and are acting with urgency to position the business for sustainable value creation moving forward,” said\nPat Gelsinger, Intel CEO. “The momentum we are building across our product portfolio to maximize the value of our\nx86 franchise, combined with the strong interest Intel 18A is attracting from foundry customers, reflects the impact of\nour actions and the opportunities ahead.”\n“Restructuring charges meaningfully impacted Q3 profitability as we took important steps toward our cost reduction\ngoal,” said David Zinsner, Intel CFO. “The actions we took this quarter position us for improved profitability and\nenhanced liquidity as we continue to execute our strategy. We are encouraged by improved underlying trends,\nreflected in our Q4 guidance.\"\nQ3 2024 Financial Highlights\nGAAP Non-GAAP\nQ3 2024 Q3 2023 vs. Q3 2023 Q3 2024 Q3 2023 vs. Q3 2023\nRevenue ($B) $13.3 $14.2 down 6%\nGross Margin 15.0% 42.5% down 27.5 ppts 18.0% 45.8% down 27.8 ppts\nR&D and MG&A ($B) $5.4 $5.2 up 4% $4.8 $4.6 up 4%\nOperating Margin (68.2)% (0.1)% down 68.1 ppts (17.8)% 13.6% down 31.4 ppts\nTax Rate (87.0)% 696.2% n/m* 13.0% 13.0% —\nNet Income (loss)\n$(16.6) $0.3 n/m* $(2.0) $1.7 n/m*\nAttributable to Intel ($B)\nEarnings (loss) Per Share\n$(3.88) $0.07 n/m* $(0.46) $0.41 n/m*\nAttributable to Intel\nIn the third quarter, the company generated $4.1 billion in cash from operations and paid dividends of $0.5 billion.\n*Not meaningful\nExhibit 99.1\nQ3 2024 Restructuring and Impairment Charges\nIn the third quarter, the company made significant progress on its $10 billion cost reduction plan. The plan aims to\ndrive operational efficiency and agility, accelerate profitable growth and create capacity for ongoing strategic\ninvestment in technology and manufacturing leadership. These initiatives include structural and operating\nrealignment across the company, alongside reductions in headcount, operating expenses and capital expenditures.\nAs a result of these actions, the company recognized $2.8 billion in restructuring charges in Q3 2024, $528 million\nof which are non-cash charges and $2.2 billion of which will be cash settled in the future.\nIntel's third quarter results were also materially impacted by the following charges:\n• $3.1 billion of charges, substantially all of which were recognized in cost of sales, related to non-cash\nimpairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of\nwhich related to the Intel 7 process node, based upon an evaluation of current process technology node\ncapacities relative to projected market demand for Intel products and services;\n• $2.9 billion of non-cash charges associated with the impairment of goodwill for certain reporting units –\nprimarily the Mobileye reporting unit – as well as certain acquired intangible assets; and\n• $9.9 billion of non-cash charges related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against U.S. deferred\ntax assets.\nThe restructuring charges of $2.8 billion and the asset impairment charges, including the allowance against our\ndeferred tax assets, and accelerated depreciation of $15.9 billion increased GAAP loss per share attributable to\nIntel by $3.89. The restructuring charges, impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, and deferred tax asset\nvaluation allowance had no impact on non-GAAP loss per share attributable to Intel. The impairment charges and\naccelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets of $3.1 billion increased GAAP and non-GAAP loss per\nshare attributable to Intel by $0.57 and $0.63 per share, respectively. These charges were not incorporated into the\nguidance Intel provided for the third quarter of 2024.\nIntel/Page 3\nBusiness Unit Summary\nIn October 2022, Intel announced an internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024\nand created a foundry relationship between its Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCAI and NEX) and its\nIntel Foundry business (including Foundry Technology Development, Foundry Manufacturing and Supply Chain and\nFoundry Services, formerly IFS). The foundry operating model is designed to reshape operational dynamics and\ndrive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. In furtherance of Intel's internal foundry\noperating model, Intel announced in the third quarter of 2024 its intent to establish Intel Foundry as an independent\nsubsidiary. The company also previously announced its intent to operate Altera® as a standalone business beginning\nin the first quarter of 2024. Altera was previously included in DCAI's segment results. As a result of these changes,\nthe company modified its segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. All prior-\nperiod segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way the company internally receives\ninformation and manages and monitors its operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2024. There are no\nchanges to Intel’s consolidated financial statements for any prior periods.\nBusiness Unit Revenue and Trends Q3 2024 vs. Q3 2023\nIntel Products:\nClient Computing Group (CCG) $7.3 billion down 7%\nData Center and AI (DCAI) $3.3 billion up 9%\nNetwork and Edge (NEX) $1.5 billion up 4%\nTotal Intel Products revenue $12.2 billion down 2%\nIntel Foundry $4.4 billion down 8%\nAll other:\nAltera $412 million down 44%\nMobileye $485 million down 8%\nOther $142 million down 24%\nTotal all other revenue $1,039 million down 28%\nIntersegment eliminations $(4.3) billion\nTotal net revenue $13.3 billion down 6%\nIntel Products Highlights\n▪ Intel announced plans with AMD to create the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group, bringing together leaders\nfrom across the industry to help shape the future of x86. The Ecosystem Advisory Group is focused on\nsimplifying software development, ensuring interoperability and interface consistency across vendors and\nproviding developers with standard architectural tools and instructions. Broadcom, Dell, Google, HPE, HP\nInc., Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Red Hat have signed on as founding members.\n▪ CCG: Intel continues to lead the AI PC category and is on track to ship more than 100 million AI PCs by the\nend of 2025.

This\nmonth, Intel launched the new Intel® Core™ Ultra 200S processors, code-named Arrow Lake, that will scale\nAI PC capabilities to desktop platforms and usher in the first enthusiast desktop AI PCs.\n▪ DCAI: Intel launched Intel® Xeon®, doubling the performance of the prior generation with increased core\ncounts, memory bandwidth, and embedded AI acceleration. Intel also launched its Intel® Gaudi® 3 AI\naccelerators, delivering twice the networking bandwidth and 1.5x the memory bandwidth of its predecessor\nfor large language model efficiency. IBM and Intel announced a global collaboration to deploy Intel Gaudi 3\nAI accelerators as a service on IBM Cloud, aiming to help more cost-effectively scale enterprise AI and drive\ninnovation underpinned with security and resiliency.\n• NEX: Intel achieved a significant design win earlier this month with KDDI, a major global telecom,\nannouncing its selection of Samsung's vRAN 3.0 solution powered by 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable\nprocessors with Intel vRAN Boost.\nIntel/Page 4\nIntel Foundry Highlights\n▪ Intel’s fifth node in four years, Intel 18A, will complete a historic pace of design and process innovation,\nreturning Intel to process leadership. Intel 18A is healthy and continues to progress well, and the company’s\ntwo lead products, Panther Lake for client and Clearwater Forest for servers, have met early Intel 18A\nmilestones ahead of next year's launches.\n▪ Intel and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are finalizing a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar commitment to expand\nthe companies' existing partnership to include a new custom Xeon 6 chip for AWS on Intel 3 and a new AI\nfabric chip for AWS on Intel 18A.\n▪ The Biden-Harris Administration announced that Intel was awarded up to $3 billion in direct funding under\nthe CHIPS and Science Act for the Secure Enclave program. The program is designed to expand the\ntrusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the U.S. government and fortify the domestic\nsemiconductor supply chain.\n▪ Intel announced its intention to establish Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. This structure\nprovides clearer separation for external foundry customers and suppliers between Intel Foundry and Intel\nProducts. It also gives Intel future flexibility to evaluate independent sources of funding and optimize the\ncapital structure of Intel Foundry and Intel Products.\nBusiness Outlook\nIntel's guidance for the fourth quarter of 2024 includes both GAAP and non-GAAP estimates as follows:\nQ4 2024 GAAP Non-GAAP\nRevenue $13.3-14.3 billion\nGross Margin 36.5% 39.5%\nTax Rate (50)% 13%\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Intel—Diluted $(0.24) $0.12\nReconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included below.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful\nsupplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results\nbetween periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater\ntransparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our\nperformance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus\nplans.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the\nrelated effects to income taxes and net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests effects. Income tax\neffects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 13% across all adjustments. We project this long-\nterm non-GAAP tax rate on at least an annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes\nthe income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax\nstructure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate.\nThis long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving\nglobal tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business\noperations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans\nand in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and\nprovides useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Non-GAAP adjustments attributable to non-\ncontrolling interests are calculated by adjusting for the minority stockholder portion of non-GAAP adjustments we\nmake for relevant acquisition-related costs, share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, and\nincome tax effects, as applicable to each majority-owned subsidiary.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures\ncalculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and\nreconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.\nNon-GAAP\nadjustment or\nmeasure Definition Usefulness to management and investors\nAcquisition-related Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-\nadjustments consists of amortization of intangible assets such related intangible assets for purposes of calculating\nas developed technology, brands, and customer certain non-GAAP measures because these charges\nrelationships acquired in connection with business are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted\ncombinations.

We believe these adjustments provide\ninvestors with a useful view, through the eyes of\nmanagement, of our core business model, how\nmanagement currently evaluates core operational\nperformance, and additional means to evaluate\nexpense trends, including in comparison to other peer\ncompanies.\nIntel/Page 12\nNon-GAAP\nadjustment or\nmeasure Definition Usefulness to management and investors\nRestructuring and Restructuring charges are costs associated with a We exclude restructuring and other charges, including\nother charges restructuring plan and are primarily related to any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods,\nemployee severance and benefit arrangements.

That said, Q3 profitability was negatively impacted by the charges we\nreferenced on our Q2 call. This reflects the aggressive actions we are taking to lower our costs,\nimprove our efficiency and enhance our market competitiveness. Dave will go into these charges\nin detail shortly.\nOperationally, Q3 results exceeded our expectations as we achieved key milestones across Intel\nFoundry and Intel Products. Underlying trends in the business are improving at a measured pace,\nand our outlook for Q4 is modestly above current consensus.\nOverall, our stepped-up focus on efficiency and execution across the business is having a positive\nimpact. We have a lot more ahead, and we are acting with urgency to deliver on our priorities. We\nneed to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before, and our teams are embracing this\nmindset as we build a leaner, more profitable Intel.\nNow, let me provide more detail, starting with an update on our cost reduction plan that we\nannounced three months ago.\nFirst, we completed the vast majority of our headcount actions during Q3, and we are on track to\nour greater than 15% workforce reduction before the end of the year. These were hard but\nnecessary changes that are reducing complexity, and making us a leaner, faster and more agile\ncompany.\nSecond, we have reduced our capital expenditures by over 20% relative to the plan we had\nentering the year. We are now well positioned with our “shell-ahead” strategy to react quickly to\nmarket demand. With our transition to EUV now complete and the launch of Intel 18A on the\nhorizon, we have a more normal cadence of node development at Intel 14A and beyond. In\naddition, our teams are maniacally focused on improving fab productivity, allowing us to produce\nmore with less, over time.\nThird, we have begun to simplify and streamline parts of our portfolio to unlock efficiencies and\ncreate value. We are re-establishing product portfolio leadership by narrowing our focus on fewer\nCEO/CFO Earnings Call Comments\nprojects, with the top priority being to maximize the value of our x86 franchise across the client,\nedge and data center markets.\nAs part of our portfolio simplification, we will move our edge business into CCG (Client\nComputing Group) and refocus our NEX (Network and Edge Group) portfolio on networking and\ntelco. We will also integrate our software business into our core business units to foster more\nintegrated solutions that address our customers’ most difficult challenges. We are evaluating\nother portfolio actions, which we will communicate when appropriate, and we plan to provide new\nsegment reporting that reflects these portfolio shifts in Q1 of 2025.\nRelated to our cost and efficiency actions, the restructuring charges we took in Q3 were\nsignificant and necessary to right-size the company as we reduce spending by over $10 billion in\n2025. There was also a sizeable impairment mostly related to Intel 7 equipment and space,\nreflecting excess COVID-era spending that we have concluded cannot migrate to more advanced\nnodes now that we have fully transitioned to EUV processing.\nFrom a broader financial perspective, the actions we took in Q3 go a long way towards delivering\nthe 2025 financial commitments we outlined last quarter. Specifically, we plan to reduce non-\nproduct cost of sales by $1 billion, lower OpEx (operating expenses) to $17.5 billion and drive\ngross and net CapEx (capital expenditures) to between $20 billion to $23 billion and $12 billion to\n$14 billion, respectively. We expect adjusted free cash flow to be positive next year, and we will\nfocus on decreasing leverage and improving liquidity.\nLet me go into greater detail on the business, starting with Intel Products. We continue to focus on\nour core x86 franchise and the ecosystems we have developed over 40-plus years of investing.\nThey are a tangible source of value and differentiation for Intel, our partners and our collective\ncustomers, and help to cement the x86 architecture as uniquely positioned to meet customer\ndemands going forward.\nWe are taking steps to supercharge and further unlock the value of our x86 franchise. We intend to\ndrive new levels of customization, compatibility and scalability needed to meet current and future\ndemands of next-generation computing. And we see this unlocking a range of meaningful\nopportunities across all our businesses.\nI am particularly excited about our recent announcement with AMD to create the x86 Ecosystem\nAdvisory Group. We are bringing together leaders from across the ecosystem to help shape the\nfuture of x86, with a focus on simplifying software development, ensuring interoperability and\ninterface consistency across vendors and equipping developers with standardized architectural\ntools and guidelines. Broadcom, Dell, Google, HPE, HP Inc., Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle and\nRed Hat have signed on as founding members, as have industry luminaries Linus Torvalds and Tim\nSweeney.\nTurning to our product segments, in CCG, we continue to lead the AI PC category. In September\nat IFA, we launched our Intel® Core™ Ultra 200V series processors, formerly code-named Lunar\nLake. This is the most efficient family of x86 processors ever created – setting a new standard for\nmobile AI performance and significantly outperforming competitor platforms. Lunar Lake’s\ncombination of superior performance at comparable and competitive battery life positions us well\nto continue to define and lead the AI PC category.\nWe also continue to nurture the most robust AI PC ecosystem in the industry category, with more\nthan 100 ISVs (independent software vendors), 300 applications and 500 AI models powered by\nCEO/CFO Earnings Call Comments\nCore Ultra. And we remain on track to ship more than 100 million AI PCs accumulative by the end\nof 2025.\nNext up is Arrow Lake, which launched earlier this month and brings the power of the AI PC to the\ndesktop – delivering a huge leap in performance per watt and bringing an NPU (neural processing\nunit) to enthusiast desktop and entry workstation platforms for the first time.\nAll of this is paving the way toward the launch of Panther Lake in the second half of 2025. Panther\nLake will be our first client CPU on Intel 18A – a more performant and cost-competitive process\nthat will allow us to bring more wafers home and improve overall profitability.\nOverall, we are making good progress in CCG. Our share position is strong with a product\nroadmap and ecosystem that is increasingly setting us apart from our competition – especially in\nthe enterprise market, as customers continue to see increasing value from our vPro solutions.\nTurning to DCAI (Data Center and AI Group), our focus is squarely on delivering powerful AI\nsystems that provide enterprise customers with greater choice and flexibility, optimal\nperformance per watt and lower total cost of ownership (TCO). And this quarter’s launches\nsignificantly enhance our market competitiveness, even as we recognize we have more work to\ndo.\nWe launched our latest Xeon 6 product – code-named Granite Rapids – which doubles the\nperformance of the prior generation with increased core counts, memory bandwidth and\nembedded AI acceleration. The new Xeon 6 is tailor-made to handle compute-intensive\nworkloads with exceptional efficiency from edge to data center and cloud environments.\nThis solidifies our position as the head node of choice in AI servers. Greater than 70% of GPU-\naccelerated servers are already using Intel Xeon as the host CPU, and we have a significant\nopportunity to build on this as we continue reestablishing Xeon’s competitive strength and\nmarket leadership.\nThis quarter we also launched our Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, which delivers twice the networking\nbandwidth and 1.5x the memory bandwidth of its predecessor for large language model efficiency.\nWhile the Gaudi 3 benchmarks have been impressive – and we were pleased by our recent\ncollaboration with IBM to deploy Gaudi 3 as a service on IBM cloud – the overall uptake of Gaudi\nhas been slower than we anticipated as adoption rates were impacted by the product transition\nfrom Gaudi 2 to Gaudi 3 and software ease-of-use. As a result, we will not achieve our target of\n$500 million in revenue for Gaudi in 2024.\nThat said, taking a longer-term view, we remain encouraged by the market available to us. There is\nclear need for solutions with superior TCO based on open standards and we are continuing to\nenhance the Gaudi value proposition.\nIn NEX, we announced last month that we will be focusing the business on networking and telco as\npart of our efforts to simplify our portfolio, drive productivity and enhance our market position. We\nwill move our edge business into CCG, which creates a meaningful opportunity to more efficiently\nleverage our core client business and extend our leadership to a wide range of vertical edge\nsolutions, especially as AI-on-the-edge accelerates.\nAs a simpler, more focused NEX, we are better positioned to gain profitable share in our most\nattractive markets. In networking, we continue to further open-source Ethernet solutions for\nconnectivity through our Ultra Accelerator Link and Ultra Ethernet Consortium.\nCEO/CFO Earnings Call Comments\nLet me now turn to Intel Foundry. A key part of our strategy is returning to process leadership\nthrough disciplined execution of our roadmap. Intel 18A, our fifth node in four years, is healthy and\ncontinues to progress well at this stage in the development process. Our lead vehicles for Intel\n18A, Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest, have met early 18A milestones ahead of next year’s\nlaunches.\nIn addition, we have seen good traction with the release of our 1.0 PDK (process design kit) last\nquarter and the material increase in the engagements and the number of RFQs (request for a\nquote) we are actively quoting. While we will not win them all, we are confident in our head-to-\nhead position based on feedback from potential customers. Most recently, as announced, we are\nfinalizing a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar commitment by AWS to expand our existing partnership\nto include a new custom Xeon 6 chip on Intel 3 and a new AI fabric chip on Intel 18A.\nBeyond AWS, we added two additional 18A wafer design wins this quarter from compute-centric\ncompanies and our pipeline of potential wafer designs has grown nicely over the quarter. Given\nour leadership in advanced packaging capabilities, we also added multiple back-end design wins\nthis quarter.\nWe were also awarded an additional $3 billion in direct funding under the Secure Enclave program\nto produce leading-edge semiconductors for the U.S. government. We are proud to be the U.S.\ngovernment’s partner of choice to fortify the domestic semiconductor supply chain and ensure\nthe U.S. maintains its leadership in advanced manufacturing, microelectronics systems and\nprocess technology.\nMoving forward, as we shared last month, we are creating clearer separation for Intel Foundry by\nestablishing the business as an independent subsidiary. This is important to our external foundry\ncustomers and will give us future flexibility to evaluate independent sources of funding and\noptimize the capital structure of Intel Foundry and Intel Products. We are in the process of\nforming a fiduciary board for the new Foundry subsidiary, which will include independent directors\nwith deep semiconductor expertise.\nIn our “All Other” category, our number one priority is to unlock shareholder value. For Altera,\nrevenue increased 14% sequentially and operating profit turned positive in Q3. We also\nannounced the introduction of our new mid-range and small-form-factor products, Agilex 5 and\nAgilex 3, to serve broad market customers and segments. With an increasingly competitive\nroadmap, the business is well positioned to show continued top- and bottom-line improvements.\nConsistent with what we have said previously, we remain focused on selling a stake in Altera on a\npath to its IPO in the coming years. To that end, we have begun discussions with potential\ninvestors and expect to conclude in early 2025.\nFor Mobileye, the company continues to be a leader in the development and deployment of\nadvanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). And by providing Mobileye with separation and\nautonomy, we have enhanced its ability to capitalize on growth opportunities and accelerate its\npath to creating even greater value. The company recently hosted an AI event laying out a\ncomprehensive strategy for camera-centric, compound AI systems providing a full range of\nautonomous driving solutions.\nWrapping up, our Q3 results reflect heightened focus, discipline and execution you can expect\nmoving forward. We are rigorously managing our costs and improving our profitability to create\nlong-term shareholder value. We are carefully managing our cash to strengthen our balance sheet\nCEO/CFO Earnings Call Comments\nand improve our liquidity. And we are staying closely connected with customers and partners as\nwe innovate to meet their most challenging needs.\nQ3 also reflected some very difficult decisions we made to right-size the business and I want to\nrecognize the hard work of our employees. We put some points on the board over the past few\nmonths, but we are far from satisfied. We view every quarter as a new opportunity to up our game\nand continue to execute well, and that is our mindset entering Q4.\nDave Zinsner, Intel chief financial officer (bio):\nThird-quarter revenue was $13.3 billion, up 4% sequentially and in the upper half of the range we\nprovided in August. Intel Products and Intel Foundry both delivered sequential revenue growth\neven as we navigated an inventory drawdown in client.\nTurning to non-GAAP gross margin – as you know, last quarter we guided gross margins of 38%,\nbut indicated that we expected incremental costs associated with our spending reduction plan\nand some of those costs would likely impact non-GAAP gross margin. We recognized\napproximately $3 billion of non-cash impairment and accelerated depreciation charges, primarily\nfor Intel 7, which are above and beyond our quarter-to-quarter asset adjustments, driving our non-\nGAAP gross margin down to 18% and EPS (earnings per share) to a loss of $0.46. This $3 billion\ncharge reduced non-GAAP gross margin by approximately 2300 basis points and EPS by\napproximately 61 cents per share.\nBeyond those impairment charges, we also were impacted by $15.6 billion of charges that are\nexcluded from our non-GAAP results. These charges have three main components. First, we\nimpaired our deferred tax asset balance by nearly $10 billion, which was triggered by cumulative\nGAAP-based losses over the last three years. Second, a $2.6 billion goodwill impairment related\nto Mobileye, which shows up in our consolidated earnings. And lastly is $2.2 billion associated with\nthe severance of approximately 15% of our employees, aligned with our plan to reduce operating\nexpenses to $17.5 billion and take out $1 billion of other cost of sales next year. This last charge is\nthe only charge with a cash impact. The tax asset impairment charge will not affect cash taxes\ngoing forward. Full details are in the 10-Q, which will be available tomorrow.\nQ3 operating cash flow was $4.1 billion, up approximately $1.8 billion sequentially on better\nworking capital. We had gross CapEx of $6.5 billion in the quarter, resulting in adjusted free cash\nflow of negative $2.7 billion. We expect the principal cash cost associated with the restructuring\ncharges to land in Q4 of 2024. We have $24.1 billion of cash and short-term investments, paid\ndown $2.8 billion of debt in the quarter and remain focused on de-levering next year as cash from\noperations continues to improve.\nMoving to segment results, Intel Products revenue was $12.2 billion, up 3% sequentially. CCG\nrevenue was down 1% quarter-over-quarter as customers worked down their inventory as\nexpected. DCAI revenue was up 10% sequentially as demand for traditional servers improved.\nRevenue for NEX was up double digits sequentially as elements of this business start to recover\noff a cyclical bottom.\nQ3 operating profit for Intel Products was $3.3 billion, 27% of revenue and up $400 million\nquarter-over-quarter, on higher revenue and reduced operating expenses. Operating income was\nnegatively impacted by a $300 million write down of accelerator inventory due to reduced\nrevenue expectations.\nCEO/CFO Earnings Call Comments\nIntel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.4 billion, up slightly sequentially, driven by increased wafer\nmix of Intel 4 and Intel 3. Foundry operating loss of $5.8 billion was down sequentially, materially\ndriven by the $3 billion impairment charges I discussed earlier. We expect losses to continue at\napproximately the same rate in Q4, minus this impairment charge. Next year, as we move to\nnodes with a better cost structure and realize the savings associated with the restructuring\nactions, we expect operating losses to improve significantly. Additionally, we’re intensely focused\non driving improved returns on our roughly $80 billion of tangible book value, most of which is\nassociated with Intel Foundry.\nMobileye reported revenue of $485 million and maintained full-year guidance for revenue and\nadjusted operating income. Q3 revenue was down 8% year-over-year primarily driven by a more\nthan 50% reduction in shipments to China, where comparisons will become easier as the exposure\nis now significantly smaller. Cash generation was quite strong as operating cash flow was well\nabove operating income.\nAltera delivered revenue of $412 million, up 14% sequentially consistent with guidance, to support\nimproved lead times by our distribution partners. Operating margins increased sequentially by\n900 basis points on better gross margins and spending discipline. For Q4, we expect high single-\ndigit sequential revenue growth as we work with our distribution partners to prepare for the cut-\nover to Altera independent warehouse operations. Overall, billings remain below consumption as\nend customers continue to work down inventory tied to previous supply constraints. We\nanticipate inventory normalization will continue through the first half of next year.\nNow turning to our Q4 guidance, we successfully worked down client customer inventory levels in\nQ3 in line with our expectations, and despite continued client customer inventory reductions in\nQ4, CCG should grow towards the higher end of seasonal off an abnormal Q3. Revenue is\nexpected to be flat sequentially across DCAI and NEX businesses, in aggregate.\nBased on these factors, we expect revenue of $13.3 billion to $14.3 billion in the fourth quarter. At\nthe midpoint of $13.8 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 39.5%, with a tax rate of\n13% and EPS of 12 cents, all on a non-GAAP basis. On a GAAP basis, as we continue to execute on\nour cost actions and portfolio decisions, we expect additional restructuring charges in Q4.\nWe continue to size the business to support trend line revenue growth of 3% to 5% annually with\nthe ability to scale up to 7% to 9% as demand dictates. We anticipate that our 2024 gross and net\ncapital investments will be approximately $25 billion and $11 billion, respectively. Our expectation\nis for adjusted free cash to be negative in 2024 due to the restructuring charges disclosed today\nand the uncertainty around the timing of capital offsets as we approach year-end. In 2025, with\nOpEx of approximately $17.5 billion and gross and net CapEx of $20 billion to $23 billion and $12\nbillion to $14 billion, respectively, we expect to achieve positive adjusted free cash flow.\nBefore I close, let me take a moment to remind you of a couple items as you model 2025 and that\ntoday’s restructuring and impairment charges are in service to achieving this financial model.\nFirst, we are positive on the growing market adoption of the AI PC and our strong product\npositioning. As our mix of outsourced products in CCG grows in calendar year 2025 and we ramp\nIntel 18A to support Panther Lake, gross margin expansion could be muted, particularly in the\nsecond half. We expect gross margin fall through to significantly improve in 2026, driven by the\nvastly improved cost structure of Intel 18A, the return of tiles to a meaningfully underutilized Intel\nFoundry and operational efficiencies.\nCEO/CFO Earnings Call Comments\nSecond, the estimated $700 million, on a GAAP basis, of noncontrolled income from Mobileye,\nAltera and IMS and the portion of the SCIPs (Semiconductor Co-Investment Programs) earned\nby our partners, is expected to be heavily weighted to the second half of 2025 and will continue to\ngrow in future years with the ramping of wafer outs at our SCIP fabs in Arizona and Ireland.\nIn closing, our profitability remains well below the standards we’ve set and recognize there’s much\nmore work to be done to improve the efficiency of the business. We’re encouraged by the\nprogress we made this quarter to right-size the spending, and our process and product execution\ncombined with the strong external customer traction in the quarter give us confidence our\nstrategy will deliver compelling shareholder returns.\nClosing – Pat Gelsinger, Intel chief executive officer:\nThank you all for joining the call today. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our progress and\nthe actions we are taking to improve our performance.\nWe know what we need to do – now it is all about execution. And my commitment to you is that we\nwill be methodical about delivering on the plan we have laid out.\nQ3 was a good first step. Now we need to finish the year strong and lay the groundwork for 2025.\nWe are determined to get it right – and I look forward to sharing updates along the way. Thank you\nagain and speak with you soon.\nAbout Intel\nIntel (Nasdaq: INTC) is an industry leader, creating world-changing technology that enables global progress and enriches\nlives.
