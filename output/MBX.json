(Nasdaq: MBX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel precision peptide therapies for the treatment of endocrine and metabolic disorders, today announced the publication of a peer-reviewed article highlighting results from the Phase 1 study of MBX 2109, the Company’s parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptide prodrug in development for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism (HP). The publication, titled “MBX 2109, a Once-Weekly Parathyroid Hormone Replacement Therapy Prodrug: Phase 1, First-in-Human, Randomized Trial”, was published in _The_ _Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (JCEM)_ and can be accessed [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=QF69UDrfOFm3LrItdnDqCeqtILWWvWf5i1SWQ1HIeCBmrXcdfFD-EFYtGM_n4-Jr_Az1JcMayxdzJl1I0VsZy4t5FMd_pTUrOSZQBWvhCog3Lb2ivbAWW6-4ltOBySgVe4g1w8II_lUAG3BxSFugZx6TjUEUjxTijYkxDqz509yTYicKao4uGXvNWYf-GLwFMmfY8vDiXbaUWDuun8t2W1cWLA4ewHSJU-n59quW0i4q2lIh4YPt5JsIUeipECiN).\n\n“We are pleased to have published results from our Phase 1 MAD study of MBX 2109 in _JCEM_ , a leading peer-reviewed journal of endocrine and metabolic research,” said Kent Hawryluk, President and Chief Executive Officer of MBX Biosciences. “MBX 2109’s long half-life and flat exposure profile demonstrated in the Phase 1 study may lead to a more consistent therapeutic effect and minimize symptoms from large fluctuations in calcium compared to PTH agonists with a shorter half-life. These results, combined with its safety profile to date and pharmacodynamic activity, support the continued development of MBX 2109 as a potential once-weekly PTH prodrug for the treatment of HP. We look forward to completing enrollment in our Phase 2 Avail™ trial of MBX 2109 in patients with HP in the first quarter of 2025 and reporting topline results in the third quarter of 2025.”\n\nThe publication features results from the multiple ascending dose portion of the Phase 1 study of MBX 2109, a peptide prodrug yielding a biologically active PTH agonist. The Phase 1 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of MBX 2109 in healthy adults. Forty participants were randomized 4:1 to receive four once-weekly subcutaneous doses of either placebo or MBX 2109 at 200, 400, 600, or 900 µg.\n\n**Key highlights from the publication** :\n\n  * The observed half-lives of the prodrug (79-95 hours) and the active drug (184-213 hours) reflected the prodrug design and were supportive of once-weekly administration.\n  * Peak-to-trough exposures to the active drug with weekly dosing were relatively flat, with ratios ranging from 1.47 and 1.79 across dose levels.\n  * With weekly injections, dose-proportional increases in albumin-adjusted serum calcium and concomitant suppression of endogenous PTH(1-84) were observed, consistent with the expected PTH pharmacology in healthy participants.\n  * Repeat doses of MBX 2109 were generally well-tolerated at all doses tested.\n  * Most treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild in severity. Injection-site reaction was the most common TEAE.\n  * No MBX 2109 dose-related serious or severe adverse events or deaths were reported.\n\n\n\n**About Hypoparathyroidism** HP is a rare endocrine disease caused by a deficiency of PTH released by the parathyroid glands that results in decreased calcium levels in the blood leading to hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia can result in a variety of acute symptoms, such as muscle cramping or spasm, tingling, and neurological symptoms such as depression, confusion and cognitive impairment. More serious complications can occur, including seizures and cardiac arrhythmias. As a result, HP can interfere with daily activities, negatively impacting the quality of life for patients and we estimate that HP affects approximately 120,000 people in the United States and more than 250,000 in the United States and Europe. The most common cause for HP, in approximately 75% of cases, is the inadvertent removal or damage to the parathyroid glands during neck surgery. It can also be caused by certain autoimmune processes and genetic conditions. The current standard of care for HP does not address the PTH deficiency, which is the underlying cause of the disease. To avoid hypocalcemia and its symptoms due to PTH deficiency, the current standard of care consists primarily of high doses of oral calcium supplements and active vitamin D.\n\n**About MBX 2109** MBX 2109 is a parathyroid hormone peptide prodrug that is designed as a potential long-acting hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of HP. Leveraging the company’s proprietary Precision Endocrine Peptide™ (PEP™) platform technology, MBX 2109 was designed to provide convenient, once-weekly administration and a continuous, infusion-like PTH exposure with lower daily peak-to-trough ratios than observed with daily PTH dosing regimens. MBX 2109 received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of HP.\n\n**About** **MBX Biosciences** MBX Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel precision peptide therapies based on its proprietary PEP™ platform, for the treatment of endocrine and metabolic disorders. The Company is advancing a pipeline of novel candidates for endocrine and metabolic disorders with clinically validated targets, established endpoints for regulatory approval, significant unmet medical needs and large potential market opportunities. The Company’s pipeline includes its lead product candidate MBX 2109, in Phase 2 development for the treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism (HP); MBX 1416, in Phase 1 development for the treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH); and an obesity portfolio that includes MBX 4291, as well as multiple discovery and pre-clinical candidates in development for the treatment of obesity.

(Nasdaq: MBX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel precision peptide therapies for the treatment of endocrine and metabolic disorders, today announced the completion of the last subject’s last visit in its Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose trial of MBX 1416, the Company’s long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist in development for the treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH).\n\n“We are pleased to complete the last subject visit in our Phase 1 trial of MBX 1416 in healthy adults and extend our sincere appreciation to the participants, investigators and clinical team for their support,” said Kent Hawryluk, President and Chief Executive Officer of MBX Biosciences. “This achievement is a significant milestone in our MBX 1416 program, bringing us closer to treating patients with PBH, for which there are no approved therapies. We look forward to sharing full-topline results in early January 2025.”\n\nThe Phase 1 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple ascending doses of MBX 1416 in healthy adult participants. The trial is being conducted in the United States and enrolled a total of 69 participants. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability, and secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. More information on the Phase 1 study can be found at [www.clinicaltrials.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=eAfF1sJ9Ku3IYsJUdGmKASqz9ZHae8bS2gJQ7Z0K-8SX7c-oqFqsZ-flqiwNEVou_EjETAldbiz1YqWUwQUt-wu8b8u_ybGES1KvCdCd-4M=), identifier [NCT06036784](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=W4SM2-oY-9sD0pwuZcV0eyy5sgQPqmP0DBp6lK7iyPKf_EaH_GHdUEGKd2UfQXmv3NGH9kd2OJLXl3epcEuqC3hgqOruC6MmDnWhEejzesY=).\n\n**About MBX 1416** MBX 1416 is an investigational long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist in development as a potential treatment for PBH. It was designed using the Company’s novel, proprietary PEP™ platform to prevent the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia in individuals with PBH so they can lead healthier and more independent lives.\n\n**About Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia** Post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) is a rare and serious complication of bariatric surgery. PBH is characterized by repeated episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia, triggered by exaggerated secretion of GLP-1 levels following a meal, and can present as early as six months after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy. Hypoglycemic episodes can occur multiple times per day and can periodically manifest with severe symptoms, such as dizziness, confusion, loss of consciousness or seizure. The unpredictability of hypoglycemic episodes and their associated risks may meaningfully hinder daily activities. As a result, the patient burden can be substantial, and many individuals cannot drive, work or live alone. To date, there are no approved pharmacotherapies to treat PBH. As the use of surgery to address metabolic conditions continues to rise, the incidence of PBH is expected to increase, reinforcing the need for safe and effective therapies. \n\n**About** **MBX Biosciences** MBX Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel precision peptide therapies based on its proprietary PEP™ platform, for the treatment of endocrine and metabolic disorders.

MBX Biosciences expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in its expectations or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as required by law, and claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n\nMBX uses and intends to continue to use its Investor Relations website as a means of disclosing material nonpublic information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.
