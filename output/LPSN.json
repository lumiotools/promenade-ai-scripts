(NASDAQ: LPSN) (\"LivePerson\" the \"Company\", \"we\" or \"us\"), the enterprise leader in digital customer conversations, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023.\n\n[ ![LivePerson Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/LivePerson, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/178033/liveperson_logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/178033/liveperson_logo.html)\n\n**Fourth Quarter Highlights**\n\nTotal revenue was $95.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, above the midpoint of our prior guidance and a decrease of 22.1% as compared to the same period last year driven by our exit of lower-margin and non-core business lines.\n\nLivePerson signed 62 deals in total for the fourth quarter, consisting of 16 new and 46 existing customer contracts, including 3 seven-figure deals. Trailing-twelve-months average revenue per enterprise and mid-market customer increased 11.9% for the fourth quarter to $610,000, up from approximately $545,000 for the comparable prior-year period. Beginning with the second quarter of 2022, in order to provide a more consistent and meaningful measure of ARPC, we started calculating this metric using only B2B Core recurring revenue, which is consistent with the revenue base for calculating Net Revenue Retention.\n\n\"This is a critical time in LivePerson's history, and I'm honored to be leading the company through its transformation by driving results through improved commercial and operational execution,\" said CEO John Sabino. \"There is a multi-billion dollar market opportunity ahead of us as we execute on our go-to-market strategy, lean into our product's integration and orchestration capabilities, and strengthen our capital structure. I am excited to share that these operational initiatives are already underway, and I am confident they will place LivePerson on a path to profitable growth.\"\n\n\"I'm excited to partner with John on the path ahead and I share the board's confidence in his leadership,\" said CFO and COO John Collins. \"The rapid growth in our market, coupled with repeated validation of our product by customers, investors, and third party research, makes it clear that LivePerson has a compelling growth opportunity following the rebuild of its sales and customer success motion.\"\n\n**Customer Expansion**\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company signed 62 total deals for the quarter, including 3 seven-figure deals, 46 expansion & renewals and 16 new logo deals. New logo deals included:\n\n  * A globally recognized designer;\n  * A major telecom services provider in Southeast Asia, through a partnership; and\n  * A leading personal loan provider, through a partnership.\n\n\n\nThe Company also expanded/renewed business with:\n\n  * Several financial services companies including one of the world's largest banks, a large U.K. financial services provider, a growing U.S. credit card issuer, a major U.S. credit union, and a large Australian retail bank; as well as\n  * A leading U.K. connectivity provider;\n  * A large U.S. luxury jewelry company; and\n  * A leading technology company.\n\n\n\n**Net Loss and Adjusted Operating Loss**\n\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $40.5 million or $0.48 per share, as compared to a net loss of $41.7 million or $0.55 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating loss, a non-GAAP financial metric, for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $4.0 million, as compared to a $16.1 million adjusted operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating loss excludes amortization of purchased intangibles and finance leases, stock-based compensation expense, other litigation, consulting and other employee costs, restructuring costs, impairment of goodwill, impairment of intangibles and other assets, gain on divestiture, leadership transition costs, contingent earn-out adjustments, IT transformation costs, acquisition and divestiture costs, interest (income) expense, and other (income) expense.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.7 million as compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA excludes amortization of purchased intangibles and finance leases, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, other litigation, consulting and other employee costs, restructuring costs, impairment of goodwill, impairment of intangibles and other assets, leadership transition costs, IT transformation costs, gain on divestiture, contingent earn-out adjustments, provision for income taxes, acquisition and divestiture costs, interest (income) expense, and other (income) expense.\n\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release. An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n\nThe Company's cash balance was $210.8 million at December 31, 2023, as compared to $391.8 million at December 31, 2022.\n\n**Financial Expectations**\n\nThe following forward-looking measures and the underlying assumptions involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary materially from these forward-looking measures. The Company does not present a quantitative reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures (or otherwise present such forward-looking GAAP measures) because it is impractical to forecast certain items without unreasonable efforts due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting, within a reasonable range, the occurrence and financial impact of and the periods in which such items may be recognized. In particular, these non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items, including amortization of purchased intangibles and finance leases, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, other litigation, consulting and other employee costs, restructuring costs, impairment of goodwill, impairment of intangibles and other assets, leadership transition costs, gain on divestiture, contingent earn-out adjustments, provision for income taxes, IT transformation costs, acquisition and divestiture costs, interest (income) expense, and other (income) expense, which depend on future events that the Company is unable to predict. Depending on the size of these items, they could have a significant impact on the Company's GAAP financial results.\n\nFor the full year 2024, we expect total revenue to range from $300M - $315M or (24)% to (20)% year over year (excluding $7.2M of Kasamba revenue generated in Q1 2023). In addition, we expect B2B Core recurring revenue to represent 92% of total revenue. For the full year 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA to range from $15M to $26M, or a margin of 5.0% to 8.3%.\n\nFor the first quarter, we expect total revenue to range from $79M - $83M or (21)% to (17)% year over year (excluding $7.2M of Kasamba revenue generated in Q1 2023). We expect B2B Core recurring revenue to represent 92% of total revenue. For the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to range from $(2) to $2M, or a margin of (2.5)% to 2.4%.\n\nFor the tables below, year-over-year growth rates are on a like-for-like basis (excluding $7.2M of Kasamba contribution from Q1 2023). \n\n_First Quarter 2024_  \n---  \n**Guidance**  \nRevenue (in millions) |  $79 - $83  \nRevenue growth (year-over-year) |  (21)% - (17)%  \nAdjusted EBITDA (in millions) |  $(2) - $2  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin (%) |  (2.5)% - 2.4%  \n_Full Year 2024_  \n**Guidance**  \nRevenue (in millions) |  $300 - $315  \nRevenue growth (year-over-year) |  (24)% - (20)%  \nAdjusted EBITDA (in millions) |  $15 - $26  \nAdjusted EBITDA margin (%) |  5.0% - 8.3%  \n  \n**Disaggregated Revenue**\n\nIncluded in the accompanying financial results are revenues disaggregated by revenue source, as follows:\n\n**Three Months Ended December 31,** |  **Year Ended December 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2023** |  **2022** |  **2023** |  **2022**  \n(In thousands)  \nRevenue:  \nHosted services (1) |  $ 78,600 |  $ 94,085 |  $ 332,971 |  $ 412,467  \nProfessional services  |  16,868 |  28,392 |  69,012 |  102,333  \nTotal revenue |  $ 95,468 |  $ 122,477 |  $ 401,983 |  $ 514,800  \n  \n(1) |  On March 20, 2023, the Company completed the sale of Kasamba and therefore ceased recognizing revenue related to Kasamba effective on the transaction close date.
