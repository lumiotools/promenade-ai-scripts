          "content": "Moolec Has Received USDA Approval\nFor The First Genetically Modified Pea In History\nLuxembourg. October 16, 2024 - Moolec Science SA (NASDAQ: MLEC; “the Company”), a\nleader in Molecular Farming technology, announced today that the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture’s (“USDA”) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) has completed\nits Regulatory Status Review (“RSR”) for the Company’s genetically engineered (“GE”) peas\nwhich produce iron through bovine meat proteins. This is the third regulatory clearance\nfrom USDA-APHIS achieved by Moolec in an 18-month window, alongside its genetically\nengineered safflower and soybean for GLASO™ and Piggy Sooy™ products, respectively.\nAccess the official USDA-APHIS publication here.\n“With USDA approval for our GE pea, Moolec has now secured regulatory clearance for all\nof our key crops in the US: safflower, soybean, and pea,” said Gastón Paladini, CEO and Co-\nFounder of Moolec. “We are proud to be the only Molecular Farming company with three\nUS regulatory approvals and a major commercial contract. This milestone underscores our\nleadership in the landscape with tangible, science-backed results.”\nMoolec’s genetically engineered peas produce high yields of bovine myoglobin, a protein\nthat boosts iron content, making it an ideal alternative for consumers seeking plant-based\nsources of iron. This product has the potential to revolutionize both the food ingredient\nmarket and the $65 billion pea industry by offering a nutritious, iron-rich alternative to\ntraditional meat products.\nAmit Dhingra, Chief Science Officer for the Company, stated, “The USDA-APHIS Regulatory\nStatus Review for pea marks a significant milestone for Moolec. As the first review for GE\npea, it represents a historic development. It validates Moolec’s strategic approach and\nexemplifies our commitment advancing sustainable food production through science and\ninnovation. This approval is a critical step toward enhancing global food supply and meeting\nthe growing demand for innovative, nutritious food solutions for the world.”\nThis approval not only showcases Moolec’s innovation in Molecular Farming but also\nhighlights the company’s commitment to meeting the highest regulatory and safety\nstandards. Moolec has also developed an Identity Preservation Program to ensure\nsustainable farming practices, promote stewardship for its crops and product quality for\npartners, clients and consumers alike.\nAccording to USDA-APHIS regulation found at 7 CFR part 340, developers may submit a\nrequest for a RSR when they believe a GE plant is not subject to the regulation. APHIS\nreviews the GE plant and considers whether it might pose an increased plant pest risk\ncompared to its non-GE comparator. If APHIS does not identify a greater pest risk relative\nto the comparator, the GE plant is not subject to this regulation. Regulation 7 CFR part 340\ngoverns the importation, interstate movement, and the environmental release of certain\norganisms that have been modified or produced by genetic engineering.\nThe USDA-APHIS review process is a critical component of ensuring that genetically\nengineered crops can be grown safely, and this approval opens the floor for expanded field\ntrials, seed scaling, and eventual commercialization. With increasing interest in science-\nbased ingredients, this approval positions the company to lead a new wave of innovation in\nthe food and agriculture sectors.\nAbout Moolec Science SA\nMoolec is a science-based ingredient company leader in the use of Molecular Farming\ntechnology for food and dietary supplementation markets.

Moolec Science SA (NASDAQ: MLEC; “The\nCompany”, “Moolec”), a science-based food ingredient company, announced\ntoday the harvest confirmation of US campaigns for genetically engineered\nplant-grown products GLASO™ and Piggy Sooy™ during October 2024.\nGLASO™ (gamma-linolenic acid -GLA- in safflower oil) campaign located in\nIdaho consists of 600 planted acres of genetically modified safflower, mainly\nfor commercial purposes. As a result of the harvest, Moolec is expecting to\nproduce between 300 to 400 tons of safflower seeds that contain high levels\nof GLA. To allocate most of the upcoming GLASO™ production, Moolec has\nsecured an offtake agreement with a major global CPG company, targeting the\nUS market in 2025. Following a successful and rigorous audit from Moolec’s CPG\ncustomer production is set to begin in late 2024.\nThe Company is also developing a broader commercial strategy to reach larger\nmarkets and clients. Moolec’s GLASO™ product contains almost 3 times more\nGLA than conventional sources such as borage and primrose oil, making it the\nmost concentrated GLA oil available on the market.\nPiggy Sooy™ (porcine myoglobin in soybean seeds) field trials are being carried\nout in 3 different US locations: Ohio, Missouri and Iowa. Main purposes for the\ncampaign are product development (sampling), seed increase and gathering of\nenvironmental and regulatory data to continue Moolec’s US-FDA approval\npathway. The Team also projects a remarkable first open field performance for\nits bioengineered soybean Piggy Sooy™ after recent approval for cultivation\nfrom USDA-APHIS. This has set an unprecedented milestone in biotechnology\nlast April, with Moolec becoming the first Molecular Farming company to obtain\nthis kind of clearance for food crops growing animal proteins in US territory.\nMolecular Farming company to obtain this kind of clearance for food crops\ngrowing animal proteins in US territory.\nChief Technology Officer and Co-Founder Martín Salinas stated: \"Our\ncommitment to scaling Moolec’s Molecular Farming Technology is\ndemonstrated by our GLASO™ campaign and the field trials of Piggy Sooy™.\nThese efforts not only reinforce our position as pioneers in the industry but also\nlay the foundation for sustainable solutions in agriculture and biotechnology.”\nHe then finished by remarking: “One acre of Piggy Sooy™ could potentially\nproduce pork meat proteins equivalent to 10 pigs, reducing water footprint, land\nusage and CO emissions. This is a clear demonstration on how we promote\n2\nenvironmental improvements throughout all our operations. Our aim is to heal\nthe meat production system.”\nAbout Moolec Science SA\nMoolec is a science-based ingredient company leader in the use of Molecular\nFarming technology for the food and dietary supplementation markets.

April 22, 2024 - Moolec Science SA (NASDAQ: MLEC; “The company”),\na Molecular Farming food-ingredient company, announced today that the Animal and\nPlant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\n(“USDA”) has concluded its Regulatory Status Review (“RSR”) for Moolec’s genetically\nengineered (“GE”) soybean Piggy Sooy™. See post online here:\nhttps://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/23-234-01rsr-response.pdf 1.\nThe USDA-APHIS RSR determines that Moolec’s genetically engineered soybean,\naccumulating animal meat protein, is unlikely to pose an increased plant pest risk\nrelative to non-engineered soybeans. Therefore, it is not subject to the APHIS\nregulation that governs the movement of organisms modified or produced through\ngenetic engineering (as described in 7 CFR part 340).\n“Moolec embraced Nasdaq's slogan 'Rewrite Tomorrow' and took it literally! We\nachieved an unprecedented milestone in biotechnology with the first-ever USDA-\nAPHIS approval of this kind,\" stated Gastón Paladini, Moolec Science’s CEO & Co-\nFounder. “We are unlocking the power of plants by leveraging science to overcome\nclimate change and global food security concerns. I am very proud of the Moolec\nteam, creating value for shareholders and the planet at the same time”.\nThis milestone reinforces Moolec's B2B go-to-market strategy for Piggy Sooy™\nproduct, an innovative, functional, and nutritious ingredient. By adding a well-known\nanimal meat protein (porcine myoglobin) to the standard soybean proteins, the\ncompany expects to provide food manufacturers with a unique ingredient that will\nhave a positive carbon and water footprint.\nMartin Salinas, Chief of Technology & Co-Founder at Moolec, enthusiastically\nannounced: \"We believe this milestone sets the stage for a revolution in the food-\nindustrial biotech landscape, paving the way for expedited adoption of Molecular\nFarming technology by other industry players. Also, this compelling advancement\nsignifies a stride in enhancing our operational efficiency, transforming our methods of\nraw material sourcing, and optimizing our downstream crushing and processing\noperations.”\nIn June 2023, the company announced that Piggy Sooy™ seeds had achieved high\nlevels of expression of pork protein (up to 26.6% of the total soluble protein) and had\npatented their technology. The company clarifies that Piggy Sooy™ development is\nset to keep moving forward completing the necessary consultation with the United\nStates Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Moolec declares to be engaged in the\nconsultation process with the FDA, representing the next pivotal regulatory milestone\npreceding the commercial availability of Piggy Sooy™ ingredient.\n1 In the first paragraph of the USDA-APHIS online response letter, please note that the term \"gene editing\" should\nbe understood as \"genetic engineering\" due to an unintentional error that may be addressed in the coming days.\nAbout Moolec Science SA\nMoolec is a science-based ingredient company leader in the use of Molecular Farming\ntechnology for food and dietary supplementation markets.
