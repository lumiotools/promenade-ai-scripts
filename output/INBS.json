(Nasdaq: INBS) (\"INBS\" or the \"Company\"), a medical technology company delivering intelligent, rapid, non-invasive testing solutions, today announced strong initial results from its Pharmacokinetic (PK) study required for an FDA 510(k) submission. The data from the PK study shows that fingerprint sweat mimics the rate and extent of codeine in blood and saliva. The study successfully demonstrated that fingerprint sweat provides a reliable sample matrix for drug detection, showing quantitative PK data closely aligned to blood, based on statistical comparisons made at the 95% confidence level.\n\n\"The close correlation of PK parameters in fingerprint sweat and blood highlights its robustness as a sampling approach. While independent data has consistently supported this, our clinical study further reinforces these findings,” said Harry Simeonidis, President and CEO of Intelligent Bio Solutions. “We are very pleased with the PK study results. This data highlights the potential for our technology to achieve widespread adoption in safety-critical industries and beyond, marking a significant achievement as we advance toward FDA clearance in the United States.\"\n\nFDA 510(k) clearance would enable INBS to introduce its innovative drug screening technology to the US market in 2025. The PK study results and other clinical data from the Company's clinical study plan will be submitted as part of the Company's 510(k) submission, expected in the fourth calendar quarter of this year. INBS is well-positioned to meet the increasing demand for drug testing in the United States, particularly in safety-critical industries like construction, mining, and transportation, as well as in law enforcement, drug rehabilitation, and forensic sectors.\n\n**Results: Average Codeine Values in Whole Blood, Oral Fluid and Fingerprint Sweat****1**\n\n![Results: Average Codeine Values in Whole Blood, Oral Fluid and Fingerprint Sweat](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/6806ebb4-b738-4c65-b0a0-e6a4c1dc9626/image1.png)\n\nThe study results show that fingerprint sweat is a strong indicator of codeine ingestion. They further validate the ability of INBS' method to provide rapid and reliable drug screening through a simple fingerprint sweat sample without invasive procedures.\n\nThe PK study, conducted in partnership with Cliantha Research, required a minimum of 36 subjects. The Company successfully recruited 39 healthy adult subjects from diverse backgrounds, including varying genders, ages, and ethnicities. The study compared the levels of opiates detected in fingerprint sweat with those found in blood, oral fluid, and urine samples following the medically supervised administration of codeine. All fingerprint sweat specimens collected using INBS' Intelligent Fingerprinting Drug Screening System, were analyzed by a validated, traceable liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, widely accepted as the gold standard for such studies.\n\n**About Intelligent Bio Solutions**\n\nIntelligent Bio Solutions Inc.
