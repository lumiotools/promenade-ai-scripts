(Nasdaq: TLF) today announced the Company's financial results for the third fiscal quarter of 2024. **Highlights from Third Quarter 2024:**\n\n  * **Revenues were $17.4 million, down 1.1% from 2023**\n  * **Operating loss of $0.3 million**\n  * **Net loss of $0.1 million, down from net income of $0.6 million in 2023**\n  * **Gross margins of 57.8%, down from 62.4% in 2023**\n  * **Operating expenses $10.3 million, up 2.3% from 2023**\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA* of $0.2 million**\n  * **Ended quarter with $10.1 million of cash and cash equivalents**\n\nTandy Leather Factory's third quarter sales were $17.4 million in 2024, down from $17.5 million in 2023. Third quarter 2024 gross profit was $10.0 million, down from $10.9 million in 2023. Third quarter saw an operating loss of $0.3 million, down from operating income of $0.9 million in 2023.

The Company had a basic and diluted net loss in the quarter of ($0.02) per share, versus income of $0.08 in the prior year. Janet Carr, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, said, \"Sales in the third quarter were consistent with the trend we saw in Q2, down about 1%, and although our September sale was strong, our customers are still spending less on discretionary items and our traffic is down. The biggest impact to our overall financial performance compared to last year is the difference in gross margin rate. Last year's rate was driven by accounting adjustments; this year was in line with our projection, but also reflected increased promotional activity as we respond to weaker consumer demand. The 2.3% increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by inflationary pressures across all expense categories, especially employment costs. Importantly, cash remains strong, up from this time last year even with a significant increase in capital expenditures compared to last year for store relocations, necessary upgrades of store computer equipment, and a new roof on our headquarters facility.\" Investors are encouraged to send their questions to the Company's investor relations hotline at [investorrelations@tandyleather.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JM9rwpfg4LTzNL3LqJLzkyLNzCcRpw1ISDBIK7AUGhWX6A3fTfuq3xUDR2rurxojQXISU9nwJFiTshM3uqMuNaMwxqPbSfl0ojTUi7WtnSFLWGUWT6ysPIY72v0hBKcRcvaWyQK_CoSJQMz6QW4-5Q==). _* Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes helps investors to compare its operating performance to that of other companies.

(Nasdaq: TLF) today announced the Company's financial results for the first fiscal quarter of 2024. **Highlights from First Quarter 2024:**\n\n  * **Revenues were $19.3 million, down 5.3% from 2023**\n  * **Generated operating income of $0.7 million**\n  * **Net income of $0.5 million, down from $0.7 million in 2023**\n  * **Gross margins of 56.7%, down from 58.1% in 2023**\n  * **Operating expenses $10.3 million, down 5.2% from 2023**\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA* of $1.1 million**\n  * **Ended quarter with $12.3 million of cash and cash equivalents**\n\nTandy Leather Factory's first quarter sales were $19.3 million in 2024, down from $20.4 million in 2023. First quarter 2024 gross profit was $10.9 million, down from $11.8 million in 2023. First quarter operating income was $0.7 million, down from $1.0 million in 2023. As of March 31, 2024, the Company held $12.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, up from $8.6 million a year earlier. The Company held inventory of $36.7 million, down from $38.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company had basic and diluted net income in the quarter of $0.06 per share, versus $0.08 in the prior year. Janet Carr, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, said, \"Our first quarter sales declined by about 5%, reflecting both a sense of malaise in the broader consumer environment and a difficult comparison against a strong first quarter in 2023. Gross margin rate also declined, as we increased promotional activity in March to offset slower sales in January and February. Operating expense discipline helped us deliver positive operating income despite challenges in both sales and gross margin. And despite over $1 million in capital investments in stores and our Fort Worth facility this year, compared to less than $100 thousand last year, we also grew cash. Going forward, we will continue the progress we made in the first quarter to improve overall quality and performance in our retail stores including filling some key retail roles and pursuing strategic store relocations, among other initiatives.\" Investors are encouraged to send their questions to the Company's investor relations hotline at [investorrelations@tandyleather.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WeXyms06pm9Fbzc1LGSZQnDnX3TJZl96txrfCrQXii1jd-TlF7OV2B2k7OdAhaff8udwrPxvIZIpHtGUFag_DIZn_Ci5RdLBZG5paPph_fZ_0rmPsRj8e5DBNQLCWV0oh699V6iBPBG7x8bo73GSSA==). _* Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes helps investors to compare its operating performance to that of other companies.

(Nasdaq: TLF) today announced the Company's financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and full year 2023. **Highlights from 2023:**\n\n  * **Revenues were $76.2 million, down 5.1% from 2022**\n  * **Generated operating income of $4.4 million**\n  * **Net income of $3.8 million, up from $1.2 million in 2022**\n  * **Gross margins of 59.3%, up from 57.9% in 2022**\n  * **Operating expenses $40.8 million, down 9.7% from 2022**\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA* of $6.5 million**\n  * **Ended year with $12.2 million of cash and cash equivalents**\n\nThe Company's full year sales were $76.2 million in 2023, down from $80.3 million in 2022. Operating expenses decreased to $40.8 million from $45.1 million in 2022 and decreased as a percentage of sales to 53.5% from 56.2% in 2022. 2023 full year gross profit was $45.2 million, or 59.2%, vs $46.5 million, or 57.9%, in 2022. Net income was $3.8 million in 2023, compared to $1.2 million in 2022. Additional details regarding the Company's 2023 results can be found in its Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024. Tandy Leather Factory's fourth quarter sales were $20.8 million in 2023, down from $22.4 million in 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 gross profit was $11.5 million, down from $12.5 million in 2022. Fourth quarter operating income was $1.7 million, up from $0.3 million in 2022.

The Company had basic and diluted net income in the quarter of $0.23 per share, versus $0.06 in the prior year. Janet Carr, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, said, \"In 2023, Tandy focused on growing profits and cash against the backdrop of an environment of weaker retail sales and continued high inflation. Our total sales did decline, by about 5% including 6 stores closed in 2022 and 2023. However, we grew our operating income by more than $3 million versus 2022 driven by disciplined management of operating expenses and some capitalizable costs like freight. Operating expenses declined by nearly 10% over 2022, as we established a new baseline cost structure. Our year-end cash also grew by $4.2 million to $12.2 million. For 2024, we will continue to manage costs while putting renewed focus on sales with selective new stores and continued improvement in the customer experience.\" The Company will host an investor presentation online (via Zoom) and by phone on Tuesday March 26, at 9:00 am CDT to discuss the Company's first quarter operating results.
