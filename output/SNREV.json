Sunrise has in issue two classes of shares: Class A Shares and Class B Shares.\n\n###### The Class A Common Shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 per share, are listed on SIX Swiss Exchange (“SIX”) under the ticker symbol “SUNN”. Each Class A Common Share carries one vote per share.\n\n###### The Class B Shares, with a nominal value of CHF 0.01 per share, also carry one vote per share but have one-tenth of the economic entitlement of the Class A Common Shares. The Sunrise Class B Shares are not listed on SIX or any other exchange. Class B Shares can be exchanged for Class A Shares in accordance with the terms of Sunrise’s articles of association at a ratio of 10 Class B Shares for one Class A Share.\n\n###### The spin-off of Sunrise from Liberty Global was successfully completed on 8 November 2024. To facilitate efficient initial settlement mechanics for a Swiss listed security, Liberty Global determined to deliver all Sunrise Shares distributed in the spin-off initially in the form of Sunrise ADSs (American Depositary Shares). Each Sunrise Class A Common Share and Sunrise Class B Share distributed in the spin-off have been in the form of one Sunrise Class A ADS and one Sunrise Class B ADS, respectively. Sunrise ADS holders have been entitled to cancel their Sunrise ADSs and withdraw the underlying Sunrise Shares since 14 November 2024.\n\n###### The Sunrise Class A ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (Nasdaq) under the ticker symbol “SNRE”. The Nasdaq listing of the Sunrise Class A ADSs is expected to be for a transitional period only in order to facilitate trading and holding of the Sunrise Class A ADSs after the spin-off. This transitional period will extend from the listing date of the Sunrise Class A ADSs on Nasdaq (13 November 2024) to a date which will be approximately nine months thereafter, with the specific date to be determined by the Sunrise Board of Directors. Sunrise Class B ADSs are not listed on any stock exchange and are tradeable only on the over-the-counter markets (OTC).\n\n###### For further information regarding the different share classes and the ADSs, please refer to the [**Q &A section**](https://www.sunrise.ch/en/corporate/investor-relations/shareholder-resources).\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%279375%27%20height=%276250%27/%3e)![]()\n\n#### **Analyst Coverage**\n\n###### **Arete** , Alex Pound\n\n###### **Barclays** , Maurice Patrick\n\n###### **BNP** **Paribas** , Joshua Mills\n\n###### **Deutsche Bank** , Robert Grindle\n\n###### **J.P.

For more information about the provisions of the deposit agreements and the depositary’s procedures, please review the deposit agreement applicable to the Sunrise ADSs which is an exhibit of the prospectus related to the spin-off which is available [**here**](https://a.storyblok.com/f/113473/x/2a8de8e464/20240920_sunrise-prospectus-filing.pdf).You may also contact the depositary by e-mail at **DR_Global_CSM@jpmorgan.com**.\n\n## FAQs\n\n## What is the Sunrise share capital?\n\nSunrise’s share capital, as registered with the commercial register of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland equals CHF 7,235,743.36 of aggregate nominal value, divided into 69,759,702 Sunrise Class A Shares (nominal value of CHF 0.10 per share, including 1,000,000 treasury shares) and 25,977,316 Sunrise Class B Shares (nominal value of CHF 0.01 per share).\n\n## Where are the Sunrise Shares listed?\n\nThe Sunrise Class A Shares are listed and traded on SIX Swiss Exchange (“SIX”) under the ticker symbol “SUNN”. The Sunrise Class B Shares are not listed on SIX or any other exchange.\n\n## Why is Sunrise listed on the Nasdaq?\n\nThe spin-off of Sunrise from Liberty Global was successfully completed on 8 November 2024. To facilitate efficient initial settlement mechanics for a Swiss listed security, Liberty Global determined to deliver all Sunrise Shares distributed in the spin-off initially in the form of Sunrise ADSs (American Depositary Shares). Each Sunrise Class A Common Share and Sunrise Class B Share distributed in the spin-off have been in the form of one Sunrise Class A ADS and one Sunrise Class B ADS, respectively. Sunrise ADS holders have been entitled to cancel their Sunrise ADSs and withdraw the underlying Sunrise Shares since 14 November 2024.\n\nThe Sunrise Class A ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (Nasdaq) under the ticker symbol “SNRE”. The Nasdaq listing of the Sunrise Class A ADSs is expected to be for a transitional period only in order to facilitate trading and holding of the Sunrise Class A ADSs after the spin-off. This transitional period will extend from the listing date of the Sunrise Class A ADSs on Nasdaq (13 November 2024) to a date which will be approximately nine months thereafter, with the specific date to be determined by the Sunrise Board of Directors. Sunrise Class B ADSs are not listed on any stock exchange and are tradeable only on the over-the-counter markets (OTC).\n\n## What are American Depositary Shares (ADSs)?\n\nAmerican depositary shares (ADS) are shares in foreign companies held by a U.S. depositary bank and traded on major U.S. exchanges. Each Sunrise Class A ADS and Sunrise Class B ADS represents the right to receive, and to exercise the beneficial ownership interests in, one Sunrise Class A Share and one Sunrise Class B Share, respectively.\n\n## What are some of the important differences between being a holder of Sunrise ADSs and a holder of Sunrise Shares?\n\nAs a Sunrise ADS holder, the depositary will be the direct shareholder of record of Sunrise, but through your ownership of the Sunrise ADS, you will have the right to receive, and to exercise the beneficial ownership in, one Sunrise Share of the applicable class, including to exercise voting rights through the depositary. Because the depositary or its nominee will be the direct shareholder of record for the Sunrise Shares represented by all outstanding Sunrise ADSs, shareholder rights will rest with the depositary or its nominee and will be governed by the laws of Switzerland and Sunrise’s articles of association. Your rights will be those of a Sunrise ADS holder. A deposit agreement among Sunrise, the depositary and you as a Sunrise ADS holder, and all other holders and beneficial owners from time to time of the applicable Sunrise ADSs, sets out your rights as the holder of the applicable Sunrise ADSs. You have the right to, at any time and at your option, cancel your Sunrise ADSs and withdraw the applicable class of Sunrise Shares.\n\nCash dividends paid in respect of Sunrise ADSs will be subject to applicable fees and expenses incurred by the depositary in connection with the distribution thereof in the amount of up to $0.05 per Sunrise ADS (depending on the amount of dividend), while no such fees and expenses would be payable by direct holders of the Sunrise Shares.\n\nSunrise ADS holders will vote the underlying Sunrise Shares by instructing the depositary how to vote the Sunrise Shares underlying their Sunrise ADSs, while holders of Sunrise Shares will vote directly or by instructing the independent proxy at any general meetings of Sunrise.\n\n## How can I convert my ADSs into Sunrise Shares?\n\nSunrise ADS holders who wish to hold the Sunrise Shares directly, rather than in ADS form, will need to deposit such shares with a bank, broker or other nominee capable of holding and trading the Sunrise Shares. Sunrise ADS holders should confirm with their brokers how Sunrise ADSs or Sunrise Shares can be held, purchased, financed and transferred.\n\nSunrise ADS holders who cancel their Sunrise ADSs and withdraw the underlying Sunrise Shares within the first three months following the spin-off do not have to pay depositary fees of up to $0.05 per Sunrise ADS for such cancellation. Regardless of the timing of the cancellation of the Sunrise ADS, holders of Sunrise ADS are always personally responsible for paying any taxes or other costs associated with such cancellation and subsequent receipt of the Sunrise Shares.\n\n## What happens to the Nasdaq listing at the end of the transitional period?\n\nSunrise Class A ADS holders should prepare for a delisting at the end of the transitional period. Upon the expiration of the transitional period and delisting, Sunrise Class A ADSs will trade in the U.S. in the over-the-counter market and holders of the Sunrise Class A ADS should plan to manage their holdings and brokerage accounts accordingly. For example, such holders may wish to cancel their Sunrise Class A ADSs and withdraw the underlying Sunrise Class A Shares prior to the termination of the Nasdaq listing.\n\n## Can I convert unlisted Sunrise Class B Shares into listed Sunrise Class A Shares?\n\nSunrise Class B Shares can be exchanged for Sunrise Class A Shares in accordance with the terms of Sunrise’s articles of association at a ratio of 10 Sunrise Class B Shares for one Sunrise Class A Share. The resulting Sunrise Class A Shares must be deposited with a bank, broker or other nominee capable of holding and trading the Sunrise Class A Shares on SIX before they can be traded on SIX. For any information regarding the exchange of Sunrise Class B Shares for Sunrise Class A Shares please contact Computershare Switzerland Ltd. at share.register@computershare.ch or phone +41 62 205 77 00.\n\n## How do I trade my Sunrise Class B ADSs or Sunrise Class B Shares?\n\nNeither the Sunrise Class B Shares nor the Sunrise Class B ADSs are listed on any stock exchange in any jurisdiction. Trading in the Sunrise Class B ADSs, if any, is only taking place in the United States OTC. OTC trading is generally much more limited than trading on any national securities exchange and is subject to greater volatility. Sunrise Class B Shares are not listed on SIX and cannot be traded OTC in the United States (other than in ADS form)\n\nYou may, however, trade on SIX if you cancel your Sunrise Class B ADSs, withdraw the underlying Sunrise Class B Shares, exchange the Sunrise Class B Shares for Sunrise Class A Shares in accordance with the terms of Sunrise’s articles of association and deposit the resulting Sunrise Class A Shares with a bank, broker or other nominee capable of holding and trading the Sunrise Class A Shares on SIX. Holders of Sunrise Class A Shares can deposit these in the ADS program and receive Sunrise Class A ADSs accordingly.\n\nFor any information regarding the exchange of Sunrise Class B Shares for Sunrise Class A Shares please contact Computershare Switzerland Ltd. at share.register@computershare.ch or phone +41 62 205 77 00.\n\n## Do I have to cancel my Sunrise ADSs and withdraw my Sunrise Shares?\n\nNo. You will only have to cancel your Sunrise ADSs and withdraw the underlying Sunrise Shares if you wish to trade on SIX. However, Sunrise expects that Sunrise ADS holders who cancel their Sunrise ADSs and withdraw the underlying Sunrise Shares for trading on SIX will gain access to what Sunrise believes will be a more liquid trading market for their Sunrise Shares over time. Such holders will also become direct shareholders of Sunrise, such that they will be able to vote directly at Sunrise’s shareholder meetings and receive any dividends directly from Sunrise without payment of fees of up to $0.05 per Sunrise ADS (depending on amount of the dividend) to the depositary bank, among other possible benefits.\n\nSunrise ADS holders who cancel their Sunrise ADSs and withdraw the underlying Sunrise Shares within the first three months following the spin-off do not have to pay depositary fees of up to $0.05 per Sunrise ADS for such cancellation. Regardless of the timing of the cancellation of the Sunrise ADS, holders of Sunrise ADS are always personally responsible for paying any taxes or other costs associated with such cancellation and subsequent receipt of the Sunrise Shares.\n\nThe Nasdaq listing of the Sunrise Class A ADSs will be for a transitional period which extends from the listing date of the Sunrise Class A ADSs on Nasdaq (13 November 2024) to a date which will be approximately nine months thereafter, with the specific date to be determined by the Sunrise Board of Directors.\n\n## How can I cancel my Sunrise ADSs and withdraw Sunrise Shares?\n\nThe cancellation of Sunrise ADSs and the withdrawal of the underlying Sunrise Shares is governed by the deposit agreement applicable to the relevant Sunrise ADSs and the procedures of the depositary. The deposit agreements provide that, among other things, if a holder of Sunrise ADSs tenders Sunrise ADSs to the depositary for cancellation together with proper instructions and documentation and the payment of applicable fees, charges and taxes as set forth in the applicable deposit agreement, the depositary will deliver to such holder of Sunrise ADSs or, upon such holder’s written order, another person, the underlying Sunrise Shares, subject only to compliance with applicable law and any temporary delays caused by the closing of the Sunrise ADS register by the depositary or of Sunrise’s share register by Sunrise in connection with, among other things, voting at a shareholders’ meeting, or the payment of dividends.\n\n### Investor Relations Contact\n\n##### **Alex Herrmann**\n\n###### **Vice President Investor Relations, Corporate Finance and Treasury**\n\n###### **investor.relations@sunrise.net**\n\n###### **+41 58 777 61 00**\n"
