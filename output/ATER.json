(Nasdaq: ATER) (“Aterian” or the “Company”) today announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**_Third Quarter Highlights_**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 net revenue declined 34.0% to $26.2 million, compared to $39.7 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting a reduced product portfolio as a result of our previously announced SKU rationalization efforts.\n  * Third quarter 2024 gross margin improved to 60.3%, compared to 49.4% in the third quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting the positive impact of our SKU rationalization efforts and less liquidation of high-cost inventory compared to the prior period.\n  * Third quarter 2024 contribution margin improved to 17.0% from 3.0% in the third quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting the positive impact of our SKU rationalization efforts and less liquidation of high-cost inventory compared to the prior period.\n  * Third quarter 2024 operating loss of ($1.7) million improved compared to an operating loss of ($6.5) million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting an improvement of 73.4%. Third quarter 2024 operating loss includes ($1.8) million of non-cash stock compensation while third quarter 2023 operating loss includes ($1.2) million of non-cash stock compensation, and restructuring costs of ($0.4) million.\n  * Third quarter 2024 net loss of ($1.8) million improved from a ($6.3) million loss in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting an improvement of 71.7%. Third quarter 2024 net loss includes ($1.8) million of non-cash stock compensation and a gain on fair value of warrant liability of $0.2 million while third quarter 2023 net loss includes ($1.2) million of non-cash stock compensation, restructuring costs of ($0.4) million, and a gain on fair value of warrant liability of $0.6 million.\n  * Third quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA improved to $0.5 million from a loss of ($4.4) million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting an improvement of 111.0%.\n  * Total cash balance at September 30, 2024 was $16.1 million.\n\n\n\n**Fourth Quarter Outlook** For the fourth quarter of 2024, Aterian Management believes that net revenue will be between $22.5 million and $25.5 million and that adjusted EBITDA will be approximately break-even.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** For more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures'' section below. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is net loss and we expect to report a net loss for the three months ending September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2024, due primarily to our operating losses, which includes stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of warrant liability, and interest expense. We are unable to reconcile the forward-looking statements of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in this press release to their nearest GAAP measures because the nearest GAAP financial measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information** Aterian will host a live conference call to discuss financial results today, November 11, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, which will be accessible by telephone and the internet. To access the call, participants from within the U.S. should dial (888) 596-4144 and participants from outside the U.S. should dial (646) 968-2525 and ask to be joined into the Aterian, Inc. call or use conference ID 4711775.

prepared in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). However, for the reasons discussed below, we have presented certain non-GAAP measures herein.\n\nWe have presented the following non-GAAP measures to assist investors in understanding our core net operating results on an on-going basis: (i) Contribution Margin; (ii) Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue; (iii) EBITDA (iv) Adjusted EBITDA; and (v) Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in making comparisons of our core operating results with those of other companies.\n\nAs used herein, Contribution margin represents gross profit less e-commerce platform commissions, online advertising, selling and logistics expenses (included in sales and distribution expenses). As used herein, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue represents Contribution margin divided by net revenue. As used herein, EBITDA represents net loss plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net and provision for income taxes. As used herein, Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair-market value of warrant liability, impairment on intangibles, restructuring expenses and other expenses, net. As used herein, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue. Contribution margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to loss from operations or net loss, as determined under GAAP.\n\nWe present Contribution margin and Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, as we believe each of these measures provides an additional metric to evaluate our operations and, when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliation to gross profit, provides useful supplemental information for investors. Specifically, Contribution margin and Contribution margin as a Non-GAAP Financial Measure percentage of net revenue are two of our key metrics in running our business. All product decisions made by us, from the approval of launching a new product and to the liquidation of a product at the end of its life cycle, are measured primarily from Contribution margin and/or Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue. Further, we believe these measures provide improved transparency to our stockholders to determine the performance of our products prior to fixed costs as opposed to referencing gross profit alone.\n\nIn the reconciliation to calculate contribution margin, we add e-commerce platform commissions, online advertising, selling and logistics expenses (“sales and distribution variable expense”) to gross profit to inform users of our financial statements of what our product profitability is at each period prior to fixed costs (such as sales and distribution expenses such as salaries as well as research and development expenses and general administrative expenses). By excluding these fixed costs, we believe this allows users of our financial statements to understand our products performance and allows them to measure our products performance over time.\n\nWe present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue because we believe each of these measures provides an additional metric to evaluate our operations and, when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliation to net loss, provide useful supplemental information for investors. We use these measures with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as sales and gross margins, to assess our historical and prospective operating performance, to provide meaningful comparisons of operating performance across periods, to enhance our understanding of our operating performance and to compare our performance to that of our peers and competitors. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue are useful to investors in assessing the operating performance of our business without the effect of non-cash items.\n\nContribution margin, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net loss, loss from operations or any other measure of financial performance calculated and prescribed in accordance with GAAP. Neither EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue should be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Our Contribution margin, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue may not be comparable to similar titled measures in other organizations because other organizations may not calculate Contribution margin, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue in the same manner as we do. Our presentation of Contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the expenses that are excluded from such terms or by unusual or non-recurring items.\n\nWe recognize that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue, have limitations as analytical financial measures. For example, neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA reflects:\n\n  * our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or mergers and acquisitions;\n  * the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest expense or principal payments, associated with indebtedness;\n  * depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash charges, although the assets being depreciated and amortized will likely have to be replaced in the future, or any cash requirements for the replacement of assets;\n  * changes in cash requirements for our working capital needs; or\n  * changes in warrant liabilities\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is and is expected to remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package.\n\nWe also recognize that Contribution margin and Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue have limitations as analytical financial measures. For example, Contribution margin does not reflect:\n\n  * general and administrative expense necessary to operate our business; •research and development expenses necessary for the development, operation and support of our software platform;\n  * the fixed costs portion of our sales and distribution expenses including stock-based compensation expense; or\n  * changes in warrant liabilities.\n\n\n\n_Contribution Margin_\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Contribution margin to gross profit and Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue to gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, which are the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP:\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**  \n(in thousands, except percentages)  \nGross Profit| $| 19,583| $| 15,828| $| 53,575| $| 45,888  \nLess:  \nE-commerce platform commissions, online advertising, selling and logistics expenses| (18,379| )| (11,364| )| (51,572| )| (33,709| )  \nContribution margin| $| 1,204| $| 4,464| $| 2,003| $| 12,179  \nGross Profit as a percentage of net revenue| 49.4| %| 60.3| %| 48.8| %| 61.6| %  \nContribution margin as a percentage of net revenue| 3.0| %| 17.0| %| 1.8| %| 16.4| %  \n  \n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, which is the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP:\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023**| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**  \n(in thousands, except percentages)  \nNet loss| $| (6,270)| $| (1,773| )| $| (66,857| )| $| (10,564| )  \nAdd:  \nProvision for income taxes| 90| (210| )| 142| 66  \nInterest expense, net| 359| 189| 1,076| 741  \nDepreciation and amortization| 452| 421| 3,416| 1,279  \nEBITDA| (5,369| )| (1,373| )| (62,223| )| (8,478| )  \nOther expense, net| (128| )| 225| 101| 275  \nImpairment loss on intangibles| —| —| 39,445| —  \nChange in fair market value of warrant liabilities| (567| )| (161| )| (2,410| )| (730| )  \nRestructuring expense| 417| (10| )| 1,633| 565  \nStock-based compensation expense| 1,232| 1,806| 6,771| 6,394  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| (4,415| )| $| 487| $| (16,683| )| $| (1,974| )  \nNet loss as a percentage of net revenue| (15.8| )%| (6.8| )%| (60.9| )%| (14.2| )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue| (11.1| )%| 1.9| %| (15.2| )%| (2.7| )%  \n  \nEach of our products typically goes through the Launch phase and depending on its level of success is moved to one of the other phases as further described below:\n\n  1. Launch phase: During this phase, we leverage our technology to target opportunities identified using AIMEE (Artificial Intelligence Marketplace e-Commerce Engine) and other sources. This phase also includes revenue from new product variations and relaunches. During this period of time, due to the combination of discounts and investment in marketing, our net margin for a product could be as low as approximately negative 35%. Net margin is calculated by taking net revenue less the cost of goods sold, less fulfillment, online advertising and selling expenses. These primarily reflect the estimated variable costs related to the sale of a product.\n  2. Sustain phase: Our goal is for every product we launch to enter the sustain phase and become profitable, with a target of positive 15% net margin for most products, within approximately three months of launch on average. Net margin primarily reflects a combination of manual and automated adjustments in price and marketing spend.\n  3. Liquidate phase: If a product does not enter the sustain phase or if the customer satisfaction of the product (i.e., ratings) is not satisfactory, then it will go to the liquidate phase and we will sell through the remaining inventory. Products can also be liquidated as part of inventory normalization especially when steep discounts are required.\n\n\n\nThe following tables break out our second quarter of 2023 and 2024 results of operations by our product phases (in thousands):\n\n**Three months ended September 30, 2023**  \n---  \n**Sustain**| **Launch**| **Liquidation/ Other**| **Fixed Costs**| **Stock Based Compensation**| **Total**  \nNet revenue| $| 32,315| $| 395| $| 6,958| $| —| $| —| $| 39,668  \nCost of goods sold| 14,999| 207| 4,879| —| —| 20,085  \nGross profit| 17,316| 188| 2,079| —| —| 19,583  \nOperating expenses:  \nSales and distribution expenses| 14,279| 224| 3,876| 2,212| 330| 20,921  \nResearch and development| —| —| —| 574| 278| 852  \nGeneral and administrative| —| —| —| 3,702| 624| 4,326  \n**Three months ended September 30, 2024**  \n**Sustain**| **Launch**| **Liquidation/ Other**| **Fixed Costs**| **Stock Based Compensation**| **Total**  \nNet revenue| $| 24,704| $| 603| $| 932| $| —| $| —| $| 26,239  \nCost of goods sold| 9,923| 169| 319| —| —| 10,411  \nGross profit| 14,781| 434| 613| —| —| 15,828  \nOperating expenses:  \nSales and distribution expenses| 10,557| 318| 489| 2,091| 457| 13,912  \nResearch and development| —| —| —| —| —| —  \nGeneral and administrative| —| —| —| 2,297| 1,349| 3,646  \n  \n**Nine months ended September 30, 2023**  \n---  \n**Sustain**| **Launch**| **Liquidation/ Other**| **Fixed Costs**| **Stock Based Compensation**| **Total**  \nNet revenue| $| 91,931| $| 595| $| 17,285| $| —| $| —| $| 109,811  \nCost of goods sold| 43,182| 319| 12,735| —| —| 56,236  \nGross profit| 48,749| 276| 4,550| —| —| 53,575  \nOperating expenses:  \nSales and distribution expenses| 41,473| 376| 9,723| 8,041| 2,091| 61,704  \nResearch and development| —| —| —| 2,674| 1,134| 3,808  \nGeneral and administrative| —| —| —| 13,020| 3,546| 16,566  \nImpairment loss on intangibles| —| —| —| 39,445| —| 39,445  \n**Nine months ended September 30, 2024**  \n**Sustain**| **Launch**| **Liquidation/ Other**| **Fixed Costs**| **Stock Based Compensation**| **Total**  \nNet revenue| $| 69,211| $| 1,482| $| 3,745| $| —| $| —| $| 74,438  \nCost of goods sold| 26,476| 508| 1,566| —| —| 28,550  \nGross profit| 42,735| 974| 2,179| —| —| 45,888  \nOperating expenses:  \nSales and distribution expenses| 30,388| 778| 2,543| 6,877| 1,702| 42,288  \nResearch and development| —| —| —| —| —| —  \nGeneral and administrative| —| —| —| 9,120| 4,692| 13,812  \n  \n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/OTFjZTg5ZDctYmYyOS00NTU5LTg2NmItOTc3MTkxN2MxZDVkLTExOTUwOTE=/tiny/Aterian-Inc.png)\n\nInvestor Contact: Ilya Grozovsky Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Development Aterian, Inc. ilya@aterian.io 917-905-1699 \n\nRequest E-mail Alerts\n\n[](#)\n\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://ir.aterian.io/news-releases/news-release-details/aterian-reports-third-quarter-2024-results&t=Aterian - Aterian Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results \"Facebook\")\n  * [Twitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=Aterian - Aterian Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results+https://ir.aterian.io/news-releases/news-release-details/aterian-reports-third-quarter-2024-results \"Twitter\")\n  * [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://ir.aterian.io/news-releases/news-release-details/aterian-reports-third-quarter-2024-results&title=Aterian - Aterian Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results \"LinkedIn\")\n  * [Google+](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://ir.aterian.io/news-releases/news-release-details/aterian-reports-third-quarter-2024-results?&t=Aterian - Aterian Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results \"GooglePlus\")\n\n\n\n![](https://t.co/i/adsct?bci=3&dv=Asia%2FCalcutta%26en-US%26Google%20Inc.%26Win32%26255%261920%261080%2616%2624%261920%261080%260%26na&eci=2&event_id=fdabdd29-f090-4f68-a53a-26e2acdfbe8a&events=%5B%5B%22pageview%22%2C%7B%7D%5D%5D&integration=advertiser&p_id=Twitter&p_user_id=0&pl_id=16d0dffa-4122-4e3a-bb58-2d552ae2416c&tw_document_href=https%3A%2F%2Fir.aterian.io%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Faterian-reports-third-quarter-2024-results&tw_iframe_status=0&tw_order_quantity=0&tw_sale_amount=0&txn_id=o5ym7&type=javascript&version=2.3.31)![](https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?bci=3&dv=Asia%2FCalcutta%26en-US%26Google%20Inc.%26Win32%26255%261920%261080%2616%2624%261920%261080%260%26na&eci=2&event_id=fdabdd29-f090-4f68-a53a-26e2acdfbe8a&events=%5B%5B%22pageview%22%2C%7B%7D%5D%5D&integration=advertiser&p_id=Twitter&p_user_id=0&pl_id=16d0dffa-4122-4e3a-bb58-2d552ae2416c&tw_document_href=https%3A%2F%2Fir.aterian.io%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Faterian-reports-third-quarter-2024-results&tw_iframe_status=0&tw_order_quantity=0&tw_sale_amount=0&txn_id=o5ym7&type=javascript&version=2.3.31)\n"

(Nasdaq: ATER) (“Aterian” or the “Company”) today announced results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\n**_Second Quarter Highlights_**\n\n  * Second quarter 2024 net revenue declined 20.6% to $28.0 million, compared to $35.3 million in the second quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting the impact of our SKU rationalization efforts.\n  * Second quarter 2024 gross margin improved to 60.4%, compared to 42.2% in the second quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting the positive impact of our SKU rationalization efforts and less liquidation of high-cost inventory compared to the prior period.\n  * Second quarter 2024 contribution margin improved to 17.4% from (3.6)% in the second quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting the positive impact of our SKU rationalization efforts and less liquidation of high-cost inventory compared to the prior period.\n  * Second quarter 2024 operating loss of ($3.2) million improved compared to an operating loss of ($36.4) million in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting an improvement of 91.2%. Second quarter 2024 operating loss includes ($2.9) million of non-cash stock compensation while second quarter 2023 operating loss includes ($3.2) million of non-cash stock compensation, a non-cash loss on impairment of intangibles of ($22.8) million, and restructuring costs of $(1.2) million.\n  * Second quarter 2024 net loss of ($3.6) million improved from a ($34.8) million loss in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting an improvement of 89.6%.\n  * Second quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA improved to $0.2 million from a loss of ($8.0) million in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting an improvement of 102.0%.\n  * Total cash balance at June 30, 2024 was $20.3 million.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter Outlook** For the third quarter of 2024, Aterian Management believes that net revenue will be between $25.0 million and $27.0 million and that adjusted EBITDA will be between $0.0 million to $0.6 million. Management continues to believe that the Company will be profitable on an Adjusted EBITDA basis for the second half of 2024.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures'' section below. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is net loss and we expect to report a net loss for the three months ending September 30, 2024 and the six months ending December 31, 2024, due primarily to our operating losses, which includes stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of warrant liability, and interest expense. We are unable to reconcile the forward-looking statements of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA in this press release to their nearest GAAP measures because the nearest GAAP financial measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nAterian will host a live conference call to discuss financial results today, August 8, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, which will be accessible by telephone and the internet. To access the call, participants from within the U.S. should dial (800) 715-9871 and participants from outside the U.S. should dial (646) 307-1963 and ask to be joined into the Aterian, Inc. call or use conference ID 2310458.

$| 50  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe believe that our financial statements and the other financial data included in this press release have been prepared in a manner that complies, in all material respects, with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). However, for the reasons discussed below, we have presented certain non-GAAP measures herein.\n\nWe have presented the following non-GAAP measures to assist investors in understanding our core net operating results on an on-going basis: (i) Contribution Margin; (ii) Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue; (iii) EBITDA (iv) Adjusted EBITDA; and (v) Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in making comparisons of our core operating results with those of other companies.\n\nAs used herein, Contribution margin represents gross profit less e-commerce platform commissions, online advertising, selling and logistics expenses (included in sales and distribution expenses). As used herein, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue represents Contribution margin divided by net revenue. As used herein, EBITDA represents net loss plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net and provision for income taxes. As used herein, Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair-market value of warrant liability, impairment on intangibles, restructuring expenses and other expenses, net. As used herein, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue. Contribution margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to loss from operations or net loss, as determined under GAAP.\n\nWe present Contribution margin and Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, as we believe each of these measures provides an additional metric to evaluate our operations and, when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliation to gross profit, provides useful supplemental information for investors. Specifically, Contribution margin and Contribution margin as a Non-GAAP Financial Measure percentage of net revenue are two of our key metrics in running our business. All product decisions made by us, from the approval of launching a new product and to the liquidation of a product at the end of its life cycle, are measured primarily from Contribution margin and/or Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue. Further, we believe these measures provide improved transparency to our stockholders to determine the performance of our products prior to fixed costs as opposed to referencing gross profit alone.\n\nIn the reconciliation to calculate contribution margin, we add e-commerce platform commissions, online advertising, selling and logistics expenses (“sales and distribution variable expense”) to gross profit to inform users of our financial statements of what our product profitability is at each period prior to fixed costs (such as sales and distribution expenses such as salaries as well as research and development expenses and general administrative expenses). By excluding these fixed costs, we believe this allows users of our financial statements to understand our products performance and allows them to measure our products performance over time.\n\nWe present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue because we believe each of these measures provides an additional metric to evaluate our operations and, when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliation to net loss, provide useful supplemental information for investors. We use these measures with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as sales and gross margins, to assess our historical and prospective operating performance, to provide meaningful comparisons of operating performance across periods, to enhance our understanding of our operating performance and to compare our performance to that of our peers and competitors. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue are useful to investors in assessing the operating performance of our business without the effect of non-cash items.\n\nContribution margin, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net loss, loss from operations or any other measure of financial performance calculated and prescribed in accordance with GAAP. Neither EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue should be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Our Contribution margin, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue may not be comparable to similar titled measures in other organizations because other organizations may not calculate Contribution margin, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue in the same manner as we do. Our presentation of Contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the expenses that are excluded from such terms or by unusual or non-recurring items.\n\nWe recognize that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue, have limitations as analytical financial measures. For example, neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA reflects:\n\n• our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or mergers and acquisitions;\n\n• the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest expense or principal payments, associated with indebtedness;\n\n• depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash charges, although the assets being depreciated and amortized will likely have to be replaced in the future, or any cash requirements for the replacement of assets;\n\n• changes in cash requirements for our working capital needs; or\n\n• changes in warrant liabilities\n\nAdditionally, Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is and is expected to remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package.\n\nWe also recognize that Contribution margin and Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue have limitations as analytical financial measures. For example, Contribution margin does not reflect:\n\n• general and administrative expense necessary to operate our business; •research and development expenses necessary for the development, operation and support of our software platform;\n\n• the fixed costs portion of our sales and distribution expenses including stock-based compensation expense; or\n\n• changes in warrant liabilities.\n\n_Contribution Margin_\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Contribution margin to gross profit and Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue to gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, which are the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP:\n\n**Three Months Ended June 30,**| **Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024**  \n(in thousands, except percentages)  \nGross Profit| $| 14,896| $| 16,891| $| 33,992| $| 30,060  \nLess:  \nE-commerce platform commissions, online advertising, selling and logistics expenses| (16,164| )| (12,024| )| (33,193| )| (22,345| )  \nContribution margin| $| (1,268| )| $| 4,867| $| 799| $| 7,715  \nGross Profit as a percentage of net revenue| 42.2| %| 60.4| %| 48.5| %| 62.4| %  \nContribution margin as a percentage of net revenue| (3.6| )| %| 17.4| %| 1.1| %| 16.0| %  \n  \n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, which is the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP:\n\n**Three Months Ended June 30,**| **Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024**  \n(in thousands, except percentages)  \nNet loss| $| (34,787| )| $| (3,629| )| $| (60,587| )| $| (8,791| )  \nAdd:  \nProvision for income taxes| 26| 205| 52| 276  \nInterest expense, net| 346| 228| 717| 552  \nDepreciation and amortization| 1,202| 430| 2,964| 858  \nEBITDA| (33,213| )| (2,766| )| (56,854| )| (7,105| )  \nOther expense, net| 176| 43| 229| 50  \nImpairment loss on intangibles| 22,785| —| 39,445| —  \nChange in fair market value of warrant liability| (2,197| )| (52| )| (1,843| )| (569| )  \nRestructuring expense| 1,216| 17| 1,216| 575  \nStock-based compensation expense| 3,223| 2,921| 5,539| 4,588  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| (8,010| )| $| 163| $| (12,268| )| $| (2,461| )  \nNet loss as a percentage of net revenue| (98.6| )| %| (13.0| )| %| (86.4| )| %| (18.2| )| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue| (22.7| )| %| 0.6| %| (17.5| )| %| (5.1| )| %  \n  \nEach of our products typically goes through the Launch phase and depending on its level of success is moved to one of the other phases as further described below:\n\n  1. Launch phase: During this phase, we leverage our technology to target opportunities identified using AIMEE (Artificial Intelligence Marketplace e-Commerce Engine) and other sources. This phase also includes revenue from new product variations and relaunches. During this period of time, due to the combination of discounts and investment in marketing, our net margin for a product could be as low as approximately negative 35%. Net margin is calculated by taking net revenue less the cost of goods sold, less fulfillment, online advertising and selling expenses. These primarily reflect the estimated variable costs related to the sale of a product.\n  2. Sustain phase: Our goal is for every product we launch to enter the sustain phase and become profitable, with a target of positive 15% net margin for most products, within approximately three months of launch on average. Net margin primarily reflects a combination of manual and automated adjustments in price and marketing spend.\n  3. Liquidate phase: If a product does not enter the sustain phase or if the customer satisfaction of the product (i.e., ratings) is not satisfactory, then it will go to the liquidate phase and we will sell through the remaining inventory. Products can also be liquidated as part of inventory normalization especially when steep discounts are required.\n\n\n\nThe following tables break out our second quarter of 2023 and 2024 results of operations by our product phases (in thousands):\n\n**Three months ended June 30, 2023**  \n---  \n**Sustain**| **Launch**| **Liquidation/Other**| **Fixed Costs**| **Stock BasedCompensation**| **Total**  \nNet revenue| $30,985| $42| $4,237| $—| $—| $35,264  \nCost of goods sold| 16,505| 20| 3,843| —| —| 20,368  \nGross profit| 14,480| 22| 394| —| —| 14,896  \nOperating expenses:  \nSales and distribution expenses| 13,841| 33| 2,290| 3,302| 1,091| 20,557  \nResearch and development| —| —| —| 1,286| 423| 1,709  \nGeneral and administrative| —| —| —| 4,572| 1,709| 6,281  \nImpairment loss on intangibles| 22,785| 22,785  \n**Three months ended June 30, 2024**  \n**Sustain**| **Launch**| **Liquidation/Other**| **Fixed Costs**| **Stock BasedCompensation**| **Total**  \nNet revenue| $26,292| $485| $1,207| $—| $—| $27,984  \nCost of goods sold| 10,092| 227| 774| —| —| 11,093  \nGross profit| 16,200| 258| 433| —| —| 16,891  \nOperating expenses:  \nSales and distribution expenses| 10,993| 239| 792| 2,192| 946| 15,162  \nResearch and development| —| —| —| —| —| —  \nGeneral and administrative| —| —| —| 2,959| 1,975| 4,934  \n  \n**Six months ended June 30, 2023**  \n---  \n**Sustain**| **Launch**| **Liquidation/ Other**| **Fixed Costs**| **Stock Based Compensation**| **Total**  \nNet revenue| $59,616| $200| $10,327| $—| $—| $70,143  \nCost of goods sold| 28,183| 111| 7,857| —| —| 36,151  \nGross profit| 31,433| 89| 2,470| —| —| 33,992  \nOperating expenses:  \nSales and distribution expenses| 27,194| 152| 5,847| 5,829| 1,761| 40,783  \nResearch and development| —| —| —| 2,099| 857| 2,956  \nGeneral and administrative| —| —| —| 9,319| 2,921| 12,240  \nImpairment loss on intangibles| 39,445| 39,445  \n**Six months ended June 30, 2024**  \n**Sustain**| **Launch**| **Liquidation/ Other**| **Fixed Costs**| **Stock Based Compensation**| **Total**  \nNet revenue| $44,494| $892| $2,813| $—| $—| $48,199  \nCost of goods sold| 16,540| 353| 1,246| —| —| 18,139  \nGross profit| 27,954| 539| 1,567| —| —| 30,060  \nOperating expenses:  \nSales and distribution expenses| 19,827| 471| 2,047| 4,786| 1,245| 28,376  \nResearch and development| —| —| —| —| —  \nGeneral and administrative| —| —| —| 6,823| 3,343| 10,166  \n  \n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/Y2NlOWQwMmUtNTg5My00OWE2LTgyN2ItZWVkNDljY2I0ZjdiLTExOTUwOTE=/tiny/Aterian-Inc.png)\n\nInvestor Contact: Ilya Grozovsky Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Development Aterian, Inc. ilya@aterian.io 917-905-1699 aterian.io\n\nRequest E-mail Alerts\n\n[](#)\n\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://ir.aterian.io/news-releases/news-release-details/aterian-reports-second-quarter-2024-results&t=Aterian - Aterian Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results \"Facebook\")\n  * [Twitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=Aterian - Aterian Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results+https://ir.aterian.io/news-releases/news-release-details/aterian-reports-second-quarter-2024-results \"Twitter\")\n  * [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://ir.aterian.io/news-releases/news-release-details/aterian-reports-second-quarter-2024-results&title=Aterian - Aterian Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results \"LinkedIn\")\n  * [Google+](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://ir.aterian.io/news-releases/news-release-details/aterian-reports-second-quarter-2024-results?&t=Aterian - Aterian Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results \"GooglePlus\")\n\n\n\n![](https://t.co/i/adsct?bci=3&dv=Asia%2FCalcutta%26en-US%26Google%20Inc.%26Win32%26255%261920%261080%2616%2624%261920%261080%260%26na&eci=2&event_id=0100dcf9-6b22-46b2-889f-d34b1c89fa96&events=%5B%5B%22pageview%22%2C%7B%7D%5D%5D&integration=advertiser&p_id=Twitter&p_user_id=0&pl_id=b794b532-1101-4f48-9ecc-561f0ac2b988&tw_document_href=https%3A%2F%2Fir.aterian.io%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Faterian-reports-second-quarter-2024-results&tw_iframe_status=0&tw_order_quantity=0&tw_sale_amount=0&txn_id=o5ym7&type=javascript&version=2.3.31)![](https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?bci=3&dv=Asia%2FCalcutta%26en-US%26Google%20Inc.%26Win32%26255%261920%261080%2616%2624%261920%261080%260%26na&eci=2&event_id=0100dcf9-6b22-46b2-889f-d34b1c89fa96&events=%5B%5B%22pageview%22%2C%7B%7D%5D%5D&integration=advertiser&p_id=Twitter&p_user_id=0&pl_id=b794b532-1101-4f48-9ecc-561f0ac2b988&tw_document_href=https%3A%2F%2Fir.aterian.io%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Faterian-reports-second-quarter-2024-results&tw_iframe_status=0&tw_order_quantity=0&tw_sale_amount=0&txn_id=o5ym7&type=javascript&version=2.3.31)\n"
