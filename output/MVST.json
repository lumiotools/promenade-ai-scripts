Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results, our objectives, expectations and intentions with respect to future operations, products and services; and other statements identified by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “objective,” “plan,” “project,” “predict,” “outlook” “should,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of these terms, or other comparable terminology intended to identify statements about the future. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our industry and market sizes, and future opportunities for us. Such forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. \n\nMany factors could cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements, including, among others: (1) our ability to remain a going concern; (2) risk that we may not be able to execute our growth strategies or achieve profitability; (3) risk that we will be unable to raise additional capital to execute our business plan or pay our debts as they come due, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all; (4) restrictions in our existing and any future credit facilities; (5) risks of operations in China; (6) the effects of mechanics liens filed by contractors that we do not have sufficient funds to pay; (7) the effects of existing and future litigation; (8) changes in general economic conditions, including increases in interest rates and associated Federal Reserve policies, a potential economic recession, and the impact of inflation on our business; (9) changes in the highly competitive market in which we compete, including with respect to our competitive landscape, technology evolution or regulatory changes; (10) changes in availability and price of raw materials; (11) labor relations, including the ability to attract, hire and retain key employees and contract personnel; (12) heightened awareness of environmental issues and concern about global warming and climate change; (13) risk that we are unable to secure or protect our intellectual property; (14) risk that our customers or third-party suppliers are unable to meet their obligations fully or in a timely manner; (15) risk that our customers will adjust, cancel or suspend their orders for our products; (16) risk of product liability or regulatory lawsuits or proceedings relating to our products or services; (17) the effectiveness of our information technology and operational technology systems and practices to detect and defend against evolving cyberattacks; (18) changing laws regarding cybersecurity and data privacy, and any cybersecurity threat or event; (19) the effects and associated cost of compliance with existing and future laws and governmental regulations, such as the Inflation Reduction Act; (20) economic, financial and other impacts such as a pandemic, including global supply chain disruptions; and (21) the impacts of geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas. Microvast’s annual, quarterly and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission identify, address and discuss these and other factors in the sections entitled “Risk Factors.” \n\nActual results, performance or achievements may differ materially, and potentially adversely, from any forward-looking statements and the assumptions on which those forward-looking statements are based. There can be no assurance that the data contained herein is reflective of future performance to any degree. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a predictor of future performance as forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to various significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. \n\nAll information set forth herein speaks only as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date hereof except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Forecasts and estimates regarding our industry and end markets are based on sources we believe to be reliable, however, there can be no assurance these forecasts and estimates will prove accurate in whole or in part. \n\n_All references to the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to Microvast Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries other than certain historical information which refers to the business of Microvast prior to the consummation of the Business Combination._\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, Microvast has disclosed in this earnings release non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP adjusted gross profit (loss), non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted net loss, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC. These are intended as supplemental measures of our financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). \n\nReconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures, gross profit and net income (loss), are contained in tabular form in the unaudited financial statements below. Non-GAAP adjusted gross profit is GAAP gross profit as adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense included in cost of revenues. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss is GAAP net loss as adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense and change in valuation of warrant and Convertible loan. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss per common share is GAAP net loss per common share as adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense and change in valuation of warrant and Convertible loan per common share. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss excluding depreciation and amortization, non-cash settled share-based compensation expense, interest expense, interest income, changes in fair value of our warrant and Convertible loan and income tax expense or benefit. \n\nWe use non-GAAP adjusted gross profit, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted net loss for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We consider them to be important measures because they help illustrate underlying trends in our business and our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with their most directly comparable GAAP measures, gross profit and net income (loss), provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. \n\nWe believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. \n\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For example, our calculation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies, or our peer companies may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore our use of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The principal limitation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements. In addition, it is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining this non-GAAP financial measure. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. In addition, such financial information is unaudited and does not conform to SEC Regulation S-X and as a result, such information may be presented differently in our future filings with the SEC. For example, with respect to the warrant liability resulting from the merger, we now exclude changes in fair value from net loss in our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted net loss calculation, which had not been done in prior periods. \n\n**MICROVAST HOLDINGS, INC.** **UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS** **(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share

(NASDAQ: MVST) (“Microvast” or the “Company”), a technology innovator that designs, develops and manufactures lithium-ion battery solutions, and Minespider, a technology company offering battery passports compliant with the EU Battery Regulation, today announced that together they will show a Battery Passport demo for the first time at IAA Transportation 2024. The event will take place in Hannover, Germany from September 17 to 22, 2024. On August 27, 2024, Minespider and Microvast announced a strategic partnership to implement Battery Passports for Microvast battery solutions for EU customers that comply with the EU Battery Regulation. \n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240916132479/en/>\n\n![Microvast Battery Passport \\(Photo: Business Wire\\)](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20240916132479/en/2244117/4/Picture_PR_Minespider.jpg)\n\nMicrovast Battery Passport (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nIAA Transportation 2024 is an international trade fair focused on mobility, transportation and logistics. Microvast and Minespider are pleased to present a Battery Passport demo during one of the key global events for businesses and professionals in the transportation and logistics markets and show how their strategic partnership will help Microvast collect, store and manage battery data in alignment with the EU Battery Regulation. The Battery Passport demo will include general information about the battery such as battery identification number, manufacturing date and place, material composition of the battery, carbon footprint information, due diligence information and other details about the battery required by the EU Battery Regulation. \n\nFrom February 2027, all electric vehicle (EV) batteries, light means of transport (LMT) batteries and industrial batteries exceeding 2kWh must have a Battery Passport in order to enter the European market. As a highly innovative battery manufacturer, Microvast understands how important it is to act before the EU Battery Regulation comes into force. As part of the strategic partnership, Minespider will assess and confirm Microvast's readiness to comply with the EU Battery Regulation, followed by implementation of the Battery Passports. Information about the battery type, chemistry and performance data and sustainability data will be listed in the Battery Passports. Microvast’s batteries will also benefit from the latest AI data management system implemented by Minespider. With the system, companies can upload documents, and the AI automatically extracts relevant data into the Battery Passport, ensuring all required information is accurately captured. Additionally, the system identifies and highlights any potential gaps in the data, enabling corrective action to maintain compliance with the EU Battery Regulation and data integrity. \n\n\"We are happy to show a demo of our Battery Passport today at IAA Transportation 2024 together with Microvast. We share Microvast’s vision that every battery component must have “a long-term, large-scale, ‘vast’ positive impact”. We are thrilled to support Microvast in having a comprehensive picture of their batteries and battery components across the entire supply chain and throughout their lifecycle.” – Nathan Williams, Founder and CEO of Minespider, commented. \n\n“At Microvast, we are committed to leading the industry in sustainable battery innovation and regulatory compliance. Our partnership with Minespider underscores our proactive approach to not only meet but exceed the requirements of the EU Battery Regulation. By initiating this cooperation well ahead of the February 2027 deadline, we are ensuring that our customers in the European Union can rely on us to deliver batteries that are both technologically advanced and fully compliant with the highest sustainability standards. This collaboration positions Microvast as a prime mover in setting the benchmark for sustainable battery practices.” – Stefan Herr, Executive Vice President Microvast EMEA, commented. \n\nMinespider entered the battery market in 2021 and developed its own Battery Passport to help OEMs and battery manufacturers comply with the EU Battery Regulation. Minespider works with industry-leading companies from the EV battery market, including Ford Otosan, Renault and TEMSA. Minespider is also a part of the European Battery Alliance (EBA), the EU Commission’s funded project BATRAW, aimed to find new technological ways to recycle critical minerals from EV batteries, as well as the Recirculate project, focused on the creation of a battery materials marketplace and enhancing the circular economy. \n\n**About Minespider**\n\n[**Minespider**](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.minespider.com%2F&esheet=54122721&newsitemid=20240916132479&lan=en-US&anchor=Minespider&index=1&md5=e395aa1744e02e3c9413b13d01d28d8f) is a technology company offering a blockchain-based platform for tracking supply chain data and creating more sustainable and transparent supply chains.
