This quarter highlights cybercriminals' rapid adaptation to new tactics, including social engineering, AI and deepfake technologies, making scams much harder to spot and more dangerous than ever.\n\n[![Q3 Gen Threat Labs Infographic](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2560943/Q3_Gen_Threat_Labs_Infographic.jpg)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2560943/Q3_Gen_Threat_Labs_Infographic.html)\n\n\"In July through September, scams continued to dominate the threat landscape, while data-theft abusing malware and ransomware also increased rapidly,\" said Siggi Stefnisson, Cyber Safety CTO at Gen. \"Our consistent focus is to empower people with the tools they need, such as the Norton Genie scam detector, so they can protect their digital lives as threats evolve.\"\n\n**A 614% Increase in Scam-Yourself Attacks** The Gen report highlights a 614% rise in \"Scam-Yourself Attacks,\" where cybercriminals use social engineering, psychological manipulation tactics, to trick people into installing malware on their own devices. The term encompasses a variety of threats, including:\n\n  * **Fake Tutorials** – cybercriminals use video tutorials on platforms like YouTube to lure people into installing malware while pretending to provide a free download for a paid software.\n  * **ClickFix Scams** – under the guise of \"fixing\" a computer issue, a fake technical solution prompts people to copy a text into the command prompt, ultimately giving cybercriminals control of their system.\n  * **FakeCaptcha** – a fake CAPTCHA prompt that copies text of a dangerous code onto your clipboard and instructs the person to install this malicious content onto their device.\n  * **Fake Updates** – malware disguised as a necessary software update guides people to paste a malicious script into their system, giving attackers admin privileges.\n\n\n\nTogether, these Scam-Yourself Attacks form a broader web of deception that's catching millions of people off guard. Social engineering continues to be one of the most dangerous tools in the cybercriminal arsenal, underscoring the importance of security products to help detect and block malware before it's downloaded.\n\n**The Surge of Data theft using Data Stealing Malware and Ransomware**\n\nWhile scams have dominated the landscape, data stealing malware and ransomware are experiencing a resurgence. Data stealing malware activity, specifically information stealers, rose by 39% overall this quarter. The most popular information stealer, Lumma Stealer, increased its share by 1154%, using methods like the previously mentioned Fake YouTube Tutorials to make its way onto people's computers to collect sensitive information including account credentials, crypto wallets and browser data.\n\nRansomware threats also increased, with a notable 100% rise in risk ratio, the potential risk per person. This quarter, the lead ransomware threat was led by Magniber, with outdated software – particularly Windows 7 – being the open door for ransomware actors.\n\nGen researchers collaborate with governments around the world to combat ransomware by providing free decryption tools for victims, and most recently released the Avast [Mallox Ransomware Decryptor](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305898-1&h=2648479738&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gendigital.com%2Fblog%2Fnews%2Finnovation%2Fdecrypted-mallox-ransomware&a=Mallox+Ransomware+Decryptor).\n\n**Mobile Threat Escalation: Data Stealing Malware Focusing on Identity and Financial Theft**\n\nData stealing malware also increased on mobile devices in Q3/2024, with criminals having an eye toward identity theft. Spyware, software that gains access to sensitive data and can even screen-record, grew 166% in the quarter. In July through September, a new strain of spyware called NGate appeared, which siphons away victims' money by cloning bank card NFC data, which is used to withdraw money from physical ATMs or make contactless payments.\n\nBanking malware – used mainly to collect banking credentials – increased by 60% quarter-over-quarter, led by the Rocinante malware with new strains such as TrickMo and Octo2 emerging.\n\nA common denominator for the key mobile threats is their delivery via malicious SMS messages. Avast, a brand of Gen, continues to enhance its defenses against mobile-specific threats, knowing that proactive protection is critical as consumers rely more on mobile devices for personal and financial transactions. To stay safe, people should avoid clicking links in unsolicited SMS messages and ensure they have comprehensible mobile security software, such as [Avast Mobile Security](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305898-1&h=651898370&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avast.com%2Fen-us%2Ffree-mobile-security%23pc&a=Avast+Mobile+Security), to help protect them.\n\n**Norton Genie Insights: Real-Time Scam Defense in Action**\n\nAs AI technologies advance, they're increasingly used by both cybercriminals and defenders. We continued to observe attackers leveraging AI-driven tactics to enhance social engineering campaigns—like generating realistic deepfakes and crafting highly tailored phishing emails and SMS messages —making scams harder to detect. Gen's AI-driven [Norton Genie](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305898-1&h=1531940016&u=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fproducts%2Fgenie-scam-detector&a=Norton+Genie) App adapts in real time to these advancements, empowering people with proactive, real-time threat detection against AI-enhanced deception.\n\nNorton Genie telemetry data from 2024 highlights that after generic scams, smishing attempts –SMS messages pretending to be from banks, delivery services or government agencies, urging people to click a malicious link – are the most common scams seen by people (16.5%). Lottery scams – those where people are notified of \"winnings\" and prompted to share personal information or pay fees to claim a prize – came in second (12%), followed by general phishing emails and texts, package delivery scams (9.6%) and fake invoices (7.7%).\n\nThis real-time scam data helps Gen continuously refine its protections, ensuring its defenses adapt as quickly as the threats people are facing.\n\nTo read the full Q3/2024 Gen Threat Report, visit: [https://www.gendigital.com/blog/insights/reports/threat-report-q3-2024](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4305898-1&h=2501204980&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gendigital.com%2Fblog%2Finsights%2Freports%2Fthreat-report-q3-2024&a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gendigital.com%2Fblog%2Finsights%2Freports%2Fthreat-report-q3-2024)\n\n**About Gen**\n\nGen™ (NASDAQ: GEN) is a global company dedicated to powering Digital Freedom through its trusted Cyber Safety brands, Norton, Avast, LifeLock, Avira, AVG, ReputationDefender and CCleaner.

In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of terms such as \"expect,\" \"will,\" \"continue,\" or similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the quotes under \"Q2 Non-GAAP Results\" including expectations relating to achievement of long-term objectives, and the statements under \"Q3 FY25 Non-GAAP Guidance\" and \"Fiscal Year 2025 Non-GAAP Annual Guidance\" including expectations relating to Q3 FY25 and FY25 non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP EPS, and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from results expressed or implied in this press release. Such risk factors include, but are not limited to, those related to: the consummation of or anticipated impacts of acquisitions (including our ability to achieve synergies and associated cost savings from the merger with Avast); divestitures, restructurings, stock repurchases, financings, debt repayments and investment activities; difficulties in executing the operating model for the consumer Cyber Safety business; lower than anticipated returns from our investments in direct customer acquisition; difficulties in retaining our existing customers and converting existing non-paying customers to paying customers; difficulties and delays in reducing run rate expenses and monetizing underutilized assets; the successful development of new products and upgrades and the degree to which these new products and upgrades gain market acceptance; our ability to maintain our customer and partner relationships; the anticipated growth of certain market segments; fluctuations and volatility in our stock price; our ability to successfully execute strategic plans; the vulnerability of our solutions, systems, websites and data to intentional disruption by third parties; changes to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices; and general business and macroeconomic changes in the U.S. and worldwide, including economic recessions, the impact of inflation, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates or tax rates, and ongoing and new geopolitical conflicts. Additional information concerning these and other risk factors is contained in the Risk Factors sections of our most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We encourage you to read those sections carefully. There may also be other factors that have not been anticipated or are not described in our periodic filings, generally because we did not believe them to be significant at the time, which could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections and expectations. All forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. We assume no obligation, and do not intend, to update these forward-looking statements as a result of future events or developments.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information** We use non-GAAP measures of operating margin, operating income, net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP and exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. We also provide the non-GAAP metrics of revenues, and constant currency revenues. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's understanding of our past financial performance and our prospects for the future. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Gen's performance, as well as in planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed according to GAAP and the methods we use to compute them may differ from the methods used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Readers are encouraged to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results, which is attached to our quarterly earnings release, and which can be found, along with other financial information including the Earnings Presentation, on the investor relations page of our website at [Investor.GenDigital.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4290617-1&h=832177788&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.gendigital.com%2F&a=Investor.GenDigital.com). No reconciliation of the forecasted range for non-GAAP revenues and EPS guidance is included in this release because most non-GAAP adjustments pertain to events that have not yet occurred. It would be unreasonably burdensome to forecast, therefore we are unable to provide an accurate estimate.\n\n**GEN DIGITAL INC.** **Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets****(1)** **(Unaudited, in millions)**  \n---  \n**September 27, 2024** | **March 29, 2024**  \n**ASSETS**  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ 737 | $ 846  \nAccounts receivable, net | 164 | 163  \nOther current assets | 297 | 334  \nAssets held for sale | 24 | 15  \nTotal current assets | 1,222 | 1,358  \nProperty and equipment, net | 60 | 72  \nIntangible assets, net | 2,442 | 2,638  \nGoodwill | 10,235 | 10,210  \nOther long-term assets | 1,512 | 1,515  \nTotal assets | $ 15,471 | $ 15,793  \n**LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIT)**  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable | $ 99 | $ 66  \nAccrued compensation and benefits | 74 | 78  \nCurrent portion of long-term debt | 1,391 | 175  \nContract liabilities | 1,749 | 1,808  \nOther current liabilities | 509 | 599  \nTotal current liabilities | 3,822 | 2,726  \nLong-term debt | 7,137 | 8,429  \nLong-term contract liabilities | 78 | 76  \nDeferred income tax liabilities | 248 | 261  \nLong-term income taxes payable | 1,396 | 1,490  \nOther long-term liabilities | 692 | 671  \nTotal liabilities | 13,373 | 13,653  \nTotal stockholders' equity (deficit) | 2,098 | 2,140  \nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity (deficit) | $ 15,471 | $ 15,793  \n_______________  \n(1) | During the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we identified and made a revision to our historical practice of when we recognize revenue from certain customers.

Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance, as well as in planning and forecasting future periods. Due to the importance of these measures in managing the business, we use non-GAAP measures in the evaluation of management's compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed according to GAAP and the methods we use to compute them may differ from the methods used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n\n_Stock-based compensation_ : This consists of expenses for employee restricted stock units, performance-based awards, stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, determined in accordance with GAAP. We evaluate our performance both with and without these measures because stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense and can vary significantly over time based on the timing, size, nature and design of the awards granted, and is influenced in part by certain factors that are generally beyond our control, such as the volatility of the market value of our common stock. In addition, for comparability purposes, we believe it is useful to provide a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation to facilitate the comparison of our results to those of other companies in our industry. \n\n_Amortization of intangible assets_ : Amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and trade names acquired in connection with business combinations. We record charges relating to the amortization of these intangibles within both cost of revenues and operating expenses in our GAAP financial statements. Under purchase accounting, we are required to allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets acquired and amortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets. However, the purchase price allocated to these assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost we would incur to internally develop the intangible asset. Further, amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. We eliminate these charges from our non-GAAP operating results to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and provide better comparability to our past operating performance.\n\n_Restructuring and other costs_ : Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit arrangements, contract termination costs, and assets write-offs, as well as other exit and disposal costs. Included in other exit and disposal costs are costs to exit and consolidate facilities in connection with restructuring events. We exclude restructuring and other costs from our non-GAAP results as we believe that these costs are incremental to core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business and do not reflect our current operating performance, and that excluding these charges facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\n\n_Acquisition-related and integration costs_ : These represent the transaction and business integration costs related to significant acquisitions that are charged to operating expense in our GAAP financial statements. These costs include incremental expenses incurred to affect these business combinations such as advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. We exclude these costs from our non-GAAP results as they have no direct correlation to the operation of our business, and because we believe that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding these costs provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the spending trends of our business. In addition, these costs vary, depending on the size and complexity of the acquisitions, and are not indicative of costs of future acquisitions.\n\n_Litigation costs_ : We may periodically incur charges or benefits related to litigation settlements, legal contingency accruals and third-party legal costs related to certain legal matters. We exclude these charges and benefits when associated with a significant matter because we do not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. \n\n_Non-cash interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs_ : In accordance with GAAP, we separately account for the value of the conversion feature on our convertible notes as a debt discount that reflects our assumed non-convertible debt borrowing rates. We amortize the discount and debt issuance costs over the term of the related debt. We exclude the difference between the imputed interest expense, which includes the amortization of the conversion feature and of the issuance costs, and the coupon interest payments. We extinguished our remaining convertible debt on August 15, 2022. During fiscal 2023, we also started amortizing the debt issuance costs associated with our senior credit facilities, which were secured upon close of the acquisition of Avast. We believe that excluding these costs provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the cash cost of our debt instruments and enhance investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective.\n\n_Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt_ : We record gains or losses on extinguishment of debt. Gains or losses represent the difference between the fair value of the exchange consideration and the carrying value of the liability component of the debt at the date of extinguishment. We exclude the gain or loss on debt extinguishment in our non-GAAP results because they are not reflective of our ongoing business.\n\n_Gain (loss) on equity investments:_ We record gains or losses, unrealized and realized, on equity investments in privately-held companies. We exclude the net gains or losses because we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business.\n\n_Gain (loss) on sale of properties_ : We periodically recognize gains or losses from the disposition of land and buildings. We exclude such gains or losses because they are not reflective of our ongoing business and operating results.\n\n_Income tax effects and adjustments_ : We use a non-GAAP tax rate that excludes (1) the discrete impacts of changes in tax legislation, (2) most other significant discrete items, (3) unrealized gains or losses from remeasurement of foreign currency denominated deferred tax items and uncertain tax benefits, and (4) the income tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustment to our operating results described above. We believe making these adjustments facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results. Our tax rate is subject to change for a variety of reasons, such as significant changes in the geographic earnings mix due to acquisition and divestiture activities or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where we operate.\n\n_Diluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding_ : Diluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding are generally the same, except in periods when there is a GAAP loss from continuing operations. In accordance with GAAP, we do not present dilution for GAAP in periods in which there is a loss from continuing operations. However, if there is non-GAAP net income, we present dilution for non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding in an amount equal to the dilution that would have been presented had there been GAAP income from continuing operations for the period.\n\n_Bookings_ : Bookings are defined as customer orders received that are expected to generate net revenues in the future. We present the operational metric of bookings because it reflects customers' demand for our products and services and to assist readers in analyzing our performance in future periods.\n\n_Free cash flow_ : Free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial condition under GAAP and does not reflect our future contractual commitments and the total increase or decrease of our cash balance for a given period, and thus should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity.\n\n_(Unlevered) Free cash flow_ : Free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. Unlevered free cash flow excludes cash interest expense payments. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial condition under GAAP and does not reflect our future contractual commitments and the total increase or decrease of our cash balance for a given period, and thus should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity.\n\n_Constant currency adjusted revenues (Non-GAAP)_ : Non-GAAP constant currency adjusted revenues are defined as revenues adjusted for the fair value of acquired contract liabilities and foreign exchange impact, calculated by translating current period revenue using the year ago currency conversion rate.\n\n_Direct customer count_ : Direct customers is a metric designed to represent active paid users of our products and solutions who have a direct billing and/or registration relationship with us at the end of the reported period. Average direct customer count presents the average of the total number of direct customers at the beginning and end of the applicable period. We exclude users on free trials from our direct customer count. Users who have indirectly purchased and/or registered for our products or solutions through partners are excluded unless such users convert or renew their subscription directly with us or sign up for a paid membership through our web stores or third-party app stores. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products and solutions across brands, platforms, regions, and internal systems, and therefore, calculation methodologies may differ. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require judgment and are also susceptible to algorithms or other technical errors. We continually seek to improve our estimates of our user base, and these estimates are subject to change due to improvements or revisions to our methodology. From time to time, we review our metrics and may discover inaccuracies or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are deemed not material.\n\n_Direct average revenues per user (ARPU)_ : ARPU is calculated as estimated direct customer revenues for the period divided by the average direct customer count for the same period, expressed as a monthly figure. We monitor ARPU because it helps us understand the rate at which we are monetizing our consumer customer base.\n\n_Retention rate_ : Retention rate is defined as the percentage of direct customers as of the end of the period from one year ago who are still active as of the most recently completed fiscal period. We monitor the retention rate to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies to improve renewals of subscriptions.\n\nInvestor Contact Jason Starr | Media Contact Audra Proctor  \n---|---  \nGen  | Gen  \nIR@GenDigital.com | Press@GenDigital.com  \n  \n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Gen Digital Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1939092/Gen_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1939092/Gen_Logo.html)\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=LA43905&sd=2024-10-30) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gen-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-results-302291977.html>\n\nSOURCE Gen Digital Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://investor.gendigital.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n[![Gen logo](//s201.q4cdn.com/771113172/files/design/logoWh.png)](/)\n\n## Quick Links\n\n  * [SEC Filings](https://investor.gendigital.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Financials](https://investor.gendigital.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n### IR Contact\n\n**Investor Relations** IR@GenDigital.com\n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

Younger voters, especially those under 35, are being targeted more, facing higher exposure to schemes like fake polls, impersonation attempts and disinformation campaigns. A survey conducted by Norton, a consumer Cyber Safety brand of Gen™ (NASDAQ: GEN), showcases the growing need for public awareness and caution during this election season.\n\n[ ![New Norton Survey Finds Younger Voters Under 35 Targeted Most with Fake Polls, Donation Scams and Disinformation](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2534000/New_Norton_Survey.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2534000/New_Norton_Survey.html)\n\n\"Election scams are a significant issue. From fake donations to disinformation intended to deceive, these scams can lead to serious financial and personal data losses, or even increase divisiveness by spreading confusion and mistrust,\" said Leena Elias, Chief Product Officer at Gen. \"Protecting voters means staying ahead of new threats and providing people with the Cyber Safety knowledge and tools they need to safeguard their personal information and confidently vote.\"\n\n**Who's at Risk?**\n\nYounger adults are most at risk of being bombarded by election scams, with two-thirds (66%) of those aged 25 to 34 reporting encounters. According to the National Cybersecurity Alliance's latest [Cybersecurity Attitudes and Behaviors Report](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4281163-1&h=1669617143&u=https%3A%2F%2Fstaysafeonline.org%2Fresources%2Foh-behave-the-annual-cybersecurity-attitudes-and-behaviors-report-2024%2F&a=Cybersecurity+Attitudes+and+Behaviors+Report), overconfidence may be a contributing factor to this, as younger generations may believe they are less susceptible to threats and engage in riskier online behavior due to a false sense of security.\n\n**Financial Losses**\n\nAlarmingly, nearly one in five (19%) individuals targeted by election scams fell victim, with 88% of victims reporting financial losses. On average, victims report losing over $7,200.\n\n**Voter Concerns: Rising Anxiety Over Election Scams**\n\nAs Election Day approaches, voters are apprehensive about scams designed to mislead them. The survey reveals that fake news and disinformation top the list of concerns, with 43% of respondents identifying it as one of their primary fears. Other significant worries include fake polls and surveys (31%), voter registration scams (31%), fake endorsement scams (23%), impersonation scams and deepfakes (22%), donation scams (21%) and robocalls (21%).\n\nThese fears are not unfounded. Several common scams have emerged during this election cycle:\n\n  * [Robocalls](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4281163-1&h=3515850325&u=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fblog%2Fonline-scams%2Fwhat-is-a-robocall&a=Robocalls): Topping the list of reported scam attempts, over one-third (37%) of participants reported being targeted by election-related robocalls, which disproportionately target Americans over the age of 55 (45%).\n  * [Fake News/Disinformation](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4281163-1&h=1118108616&u=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fblog%2Fhow-to%2Fhow-to-spot-fake-news&a=Fake+News%2FDisinformation): One-fifth (20%) of respondents reported encountering misleading information, with voters aged 25 to 34 particularly at risk—with 28% being targeted by such tactics.\n  * [Political Donation Scams](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4281163-1&h=1009275060&u=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fblog%2Fonline-scams%2Felection-scams%23id-toc-political-donation-scams-0&a=Political+Donation+Scams): One in five (19%) expressed worry about the legitimacy of texts and emails asking for money. With the average person receiving 11 fundraising messages a week, it can be challenging to sort through what is real and what is not, which is why nearly half (48%) of voters choose to delete and two-thirds ignore political messages all together.\n  * [Impersonation Scams/Deepfakes](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4281163-1&h=3119849994&u=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fblog%2Femerging-threats%2Fwhat-are-deepfakes&a=Impersonation+Scams%2FDeepfakes): About one in ten (10%) participants say they encountered impersonation scams and deepfakes, which were notably more prevalent among individuals aged 25 to 34 (20%).\n  * [Fake Polls and Surveys](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4281163-1&h=2735019806&u=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fblog%2Fonline-scams%2Felection-scams%23id-toc-fake-election-polls-and-surveys-1&a=Fake+Polls+and+Surveys): 17% of those surveyed were targeted by attempts to capture and steal personal information in fake polls, with the highest instances among the 18 to 24 age group (25%).\n\n\n\nAdditionally, while 82% of respondents confirmed their intention to vote, 40% of those voters expressed concerns about the legitimacy of polling stations. Voters 55 and older had the most confidence in polling stations (71% had no concerns vs 49% of people 25 to 34). Some of the concerns about polling stems from misinformation, raising concerns of what sources the public trusts to get their political information. Traditional news outlets are the most trusted (75%), followed by friends and family (25%). Interestingly, only about one in five (19%) said they trust official candidate platform information, only slightly higher than those who trust social media (16%). \n\n**Your Guide to Staying Safe This Election Season**\n\nTo help protect yourself from election-related scams, Norton recommends the following:\n\n  * Verify Sources: Always check the credibility of the information you receive. Stick to official election websites and trusted news sources for accurate updates.\n  * Be Cautious when Donating: If you're considering donating, research the organization first. Legitimate organizations will provide clear information on how donations are used.\n  * Look for Red Flags: Be wary of unsolicited messages or phone calls asking for personal information or money. If something feels off, trust your instincts and investigate further. When in doubt, you can check in with [Norton Genie](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4281163-1&h=4112665696&u=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fproducts%2Fgenie-scam-detector&a=Norton+Genie), a free AI-powered scam detector, and in seconds, find out if a message you received is likely a scam and what to do next.\n  * Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter a potential scam, report it to the appropriate authorities. Education is Key: Share this information with friends and family, especially younger voters who may be more susceptible to these scams.\n\n\n\nNorton urges voters to stay informed and alert in the lead-up to Election Day. Scams have the potential to mislead voters, skew public opinion and compromise personal information. It is important for people to verify the credibility of political communications and report any suspicious activity.\n\nFor more information on how to safeguard against election-related scams, visit [https://www.gendigital.com/blog/news/innovation/ai-elections-2024](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4281163-1&h=2455507822&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gendigital.com%2Fblog%2Fnews%2Finnovation%2Fai-elections-2024&a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gendigital.com%2Fblog%2Fnews%2Finnovation%2Fai-elections-2024).\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe study was conducted online within the United States by Dynata on behalf of Gen from September 13 to September 20, 2024, among 1,000 adults ages 18 and older.

In some cases, you can identify these forward-\nlooking statements by the use of terms such as \"expect,\" \"will,\" \"continue,\" or similar\nexpressions, and variations or negatives of these words, but the absence of these words does\nnot mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements other than statements of\nhistorical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including, but\nnot limited to, the quotes under \"Q2 Non-GAAP Results\" including expectations relating to\nachievement of long-term objectives, and the statements under \"Q3 FY25 Non-GAAP\nGuidance\" and \"Fiscal Year 2025 Non-GAAP Annual Guidance\" including expectations relating\nto Q3 FY25 and FY25 non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP EPS, and any statements of\nassumptions underlying any of the foregoing. These statements are subject to known and\n2\nunknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of\nactivity, performance or achievements to differ materially from results expressed or implied in\nthis press release. Such risk factors include, but are not limited to, those related to: the\nconsummation of or anticipated impacts of acquisitions (including our ability to achieve\nsynergies and associated cost savings from the merger with Avast); divestitures, restructurings,\nstock repurchases, financings, debt repayments and investment activities; difficulties in\nexecuting the operating model for the consumer Cyber Safety business; lower than anticipated\nreturns from our investments in direct customer acquisition; difficulties in retaining our existing\ncustomers and converting existing non-paying customers to paying customers; difficulties and\ndelays in reducing run rate expenses and monetizing underutilized assets; the successful\ndevelopment of new products and upgrades and the degree to which these new products and\nupgrades gain market acceptance; our ability to maintain our customer and partner\nrelationships; the anticipated growth of certain market segments; fluctuations and volatility in\nour stock price; our ability to successfully execute strategic plans; the vulnerability of our\nsolutions, systems, websites and data to intentional disruption by third parties; changes to\nexisting accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices; and general business and\nmacroeconomic changes in the U.S. and worldwide, including economic recessions, the impact\nof inflation, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates or tax\nrates, and ongoing and new geopolitical conflicts. Additional information concerning these and\nother risk factors is contained in the Risk Factors sections of our most recent reports on Form\n10-K and Form 10-Q. We encourage you to read those sections carefully. There may also be\nother factors that have not been anticipated or are not described in our periodic filings, generally\nbecause we did not believe them to be significant at the time, which could cause actual results\nto differ materially from our projections and expectations. All forward-looking statements should\nbe evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. We assume no obligation, and\ndo not intend, to update these forward-looking statements as a result of future events or\ndevelopments.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nWe use non-GAAP measures of operating margin, operating income, net income and earnings\nper share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP and exclude certain expenses, gains\nand losses. We also provide the non-GAAP metrics of revenues, and constant currency\nrevenues. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's\nunderstanding of our past financial performance and our prospects for the future. Our\nmanagement team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Gen's performance,\nas well as in planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are\nnot computed according to GAAP and the methods we use to compute them may differ from the\nmethods used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental, should not\nbe considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and\nshould be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. Readers are encouraged to review the reconciliation of our\nnon-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results, which is attached to our\nquarterly earnings release, and which can be found, along with other financial information\nincluding the Earnings Presentation, on the investor relations page of our website at\nInvestor.GenDigital.com. No reconciliation of the forecasted range for non-GAAP revenues and\nEPS guidance is included in this release because most non-GAAP adjustments pertain to\nevents that have not yet occurred. It would be unreasonably burdensome to forecast, therefore\nwe are unable to provide an accurate estimate.\n3\nGEN DIGITAL INC.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (1)\n(Unaudited, in millions)\nSeptember 27,\n2024 March 29, 2024\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 737 $ 846\nAccounts receivable, net 164 163\nOther current assets 297 334\nAssets held for sale 24 15\nTotal current assets 1,222 1,358\nProperty and equipment, net 60 72\nIntangible assets, net 2,442 2,638\nGoodwill 10,235 10,210\nOther long-term assets 1,512 1,515\nTotal assets $ 15,471 $ 15,793\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIT)\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 99 $ 66\nAccrued compensation and benefits 74 78\nCurrent portion of long-term debt 1,391 175\nContract liabilities 1,749 1,808\nOther current liabilities 509 599\nTotal current liabilities 3,822 2,726\nLong-term debt 7,137 8,429\nLong-term contract liabilities 78 76\nDeferred income tax liabilities 248 261\nLong-term income taxes payable 1,396 1,490\nOther long-term liabilities 692 671\nTotal liabilities 13,373 13,653\nTotal stockholders’ equity (deficit) 2,098 2,140\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity (deficit) $ 15,471 $ 15,793\n(1) During the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we identified and made a revision to our historical practice of when we recognize revenue from certain customers.

Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our\nperformance, as well as in planning and forecasting future periods. Due to the importance of these measures in managing the business,\nwe use non-GAAP measures in the evaluation of management’s compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed\naccording to GAAP and the methods we use to compute them may differ from the methods used by other companies. Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are supplemental and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with\nGAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nStock-based compensation: This consists of expenses for employee restricted stock units, performance-based awards, stock options\nand our employee stock purchase plan, determined in accordance with GAAP. We evaluate our performance both with and without\nthese measures because stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense and can vary significantly over time based on the timing,\nsize, nature and design of the awards granted, and is influenced in part by certain factors that are generally beyond our control, such as\nthe volatility of the market value of our common stock. In addition, for comparability purposes, we believe it is useful to provide a non-\nGAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation to facilitate the comparison of our results to those of other\ncompanies in our industry.\nAmortization of intangible assets: Amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles assets\nsuch as developed technology, customer relationships and trade names acquired in connection with business combinations. We record\ncharges relating to the amortization of these intangibles within both cost of revenues and operating expenses in our GAAP financial\nstatements. Under purchase accounting, we are required to allocate a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets acquired and\namortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets. However, the purchase price allocated to these\nassets is not necessarily reflective of the cost we would incur to internally develop the intangible asset. Further, amortization charges for\nour acquired intangible assets are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. We\neliminate these charges from our non-GAAP operating results to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and\nprovide better comparability to our past operating performance.\nRestructuring and other costs: Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to\nemployee severance and benefit arrangements, contract termination costs, and assets write-offs, as well as other exit and disposal\ncosts. Included in other exit and disposal costs are costs to exit and consolidate facilities in connection with restructuring events. We\nexclude restructuring and other costs from our non-GAAP results as we believe that these costs are incremental to core activities that\narise in the ordinary course of our business and do not reflect our current operating performance, and that excluding these charges\nfacilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\nAcquisition-related and integration costs: These represent the transaction and business integration costs related to significant\nacquisitions that are charged to operating expense in our GAAP financial statements. These costs include incremental expenses\nincurred to affect these business combinations such as advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees.\nWe exclude these costs from our non-GAAP results as they have no direct correlation to the operation of our business, and because we\nbelieve that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding these costs provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the\nspending trends of our business. In addition, these costs vary, depending on the size and complexity of the acquisitions, and are not\nindicative of costs of future acquisitions.\nLitigation costs: We may periodically incur charges or benefits related to litigation settlements, legal contingency accruals and third-\nparty legal costs related to certain legal matters. We exclude these charges and benefits when associated with a significant matter\nbecause we do not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results.\nNon-cash interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs: In accordance with GAAP, we separately account for the value of\nthe conversion feature on our convertible notes as a debt discount that reflects our assumed non-convertible debt borrowing rates. We\namortize the discount and debt issuance costs over the term of the related debt. We exclude the difference between the imputed\ninterest expense, which includes the amortization of the conversion feature and of the issuance costs, and the coupon interest\npayments. We extinguished our remaining convertible debt on August 15, 2022. During fiscal 2023, we also started amortizing the debt\nissuance costs associated with our senior credit facilities, which were secured upon close of the acquisition of Avast. We believe that\nexcluding these costs provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the cash cost of our debt instruments and enhance\ninvestors’ ability to view the Company’s results from management’s perspective.\nGain (loss) on extinguishment of debt: We record gains or losses on extinguishment of debt. Gains or losses represent the difference\nbetween the fair value of the exchange consideration and the carrying value of the liability component of the debt at the date of\nextinguishment. We exclude the gain or loss on debt extinguishment in our non-GAAP results because they are not reflective of our\nongoing business.\nGain (loss) on equity investments: We record gains or losses, unrealized and realized, on equity investments in privately-held\ncompanies. We exclude the net gains or losses because we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business.\nGain (loss) on sale of properties: We periodically recognize gains or losses from the disposition of land and buildings. We exclude such\ngains or losses because they are not reflective of our ongoing business and operating results.\nIncome tax effects and adjustments: We use a non-GAAP tax rate that excludes (1) the discrete impacts of changes in tax legislation,\n(2) most other significant discrete items, (3) unrealized gains or losses from remeasurement of foreign currency denominated deferred\n9\ntax items and uncertain tax benefits, and (4) the income tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustment to our operating results described\nabove. We believe making these adjustments facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to\npast operating results. Our tax rate is subject to change for a variety of reasons, such as significant changes in the geographic earnings\nmix due to acquisition and divestiture activities or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where we operate.\nDiluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding: Diluted GAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares\noutstanding are generally the same, except in periods when there is a GAAP loss from continuing operations. In accordance with GAAP,\nwe do not present dilution for GAAP in periods in which there is a loss from continuing operations. However, if there is non-GAAP net\nincome, we present dilution for non-GAAP weighted-average shares outstanding in an amount equal to the dilution that would have\nbeen presented had there been GAAP income from continuing operations for the period.\nBookings: Bookings are defined as customer orders received that are expected to generate net revenues in the future. We present the\noperational metric of bookings because it reflects customers' demand for our products and services and to assist readers in analyzing\nour performance in future periods.\nFree cash flow: Free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. Free cash\nflow is not a measure of financial condition under GAAP and does not reflect our future contractual commitments and the total increase\nor decrease of our cash balance for a given period, and thus should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating\nactivities or as a measure of liquidity.\n(Unlevered) Free cash flow: Free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.\nUnlevered free cash flow excludes cash interest expense payments. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial condition under GAAP\nand does not reflect our future contractual commitments and the total increase or decrease of our cash balance for a given period, and\nthus should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity.\nConstant currency adjusted revenues (Non-GAAP): Non-GAAP constant currency adjusted revenues are defined as revenues adjusted\nfor the fair value of acquired contract liabilities and foreign exchange impact, calculated by translating current period revenue using the\nyear ago currency conversion rate.\nDirect customer count: Direct customers is a metric designed to represent active paid users of our products and solutions who have a\ndirect billing and/or registration relationship with us at the end of the reported period. Average direct customer count presents the\naverage of the total number of direct customers at the beginning and end of the applicable period. We exclude users on free trials from\nour direct customer count. Users who have indirectly purchased and/or registered for our products or solutions through partners are\nexcluded unless such users convert or renew their subscription directly with us or sign up for a paid membership through our web\nstores or third-party app stores. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for\nthe applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products and solutions across brands,\nplatforms, regions, and internal systems, and therefore, calculation methodologies may differ. The methodologies used to measure\nthese metrics require judgment and are also susceptible to algorithms or other technical errors. We continually seek to improve our\nestimates of our user base, and these estimates are subject to change due to improvements or revisions to our methodology. From time\nto time, we review our metrics and may discover inaccuracies or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in\nadjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors\nthat require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed metrics\nfor any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are deemed not material.\nDirect average revenues per user (ARPU): ARPU is calculated as estimated direct customer revenues for the period divided by the\naverage direct customer count for the same period, expressed as a monthly figure. We monitor ARPU because it helps us understand\nthe rate at which we are monetizing our consumer customer base.\nRetention rate: Retention rate is defined as the percentage of direct customers as of the end of the period from one year ago who are\nstill active as of the most recently completed fiscal period. We monitor the retention rate to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies\nto improve renewals of subscriptions.\n10"

All rights reserved. 27\nUse of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Information\nWe use non-GAAP measures of operating margin, operating income,net income, results of operations, and earnings per share, which are\nadjusted from results based on GAAP and exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. We also provide the non-GAAP metrics of revenues,\nconstant currency revenues, EBITDA, reported EBITDA, diluted share count, gross profit, gross profit adjustments,operating expense\nadjustments, other non-operating expense (income) adjustments,unlevered free cash flow,and free cash flow, which is defined as cash\nflows from operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the\nuser's understanding of our past financial performance and our prospects for the future. Our management team uses these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures in assessing Gen's performance, as well as in planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are not\ncomputed according to GAAP and the methods we use to compute them may differ from the methods used by other companies. Non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are supplemental, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and\nshould be read only in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Readers are\nencouraged to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results, which is attached to our quarterly\nearnings release, and which can be found, along with other financial information including the Earnings Presentation, on the investor relations\npage of our website at Investor.GenDigital.com. No reconciliation of the forecasted range for non-GAAPrevenues and EPS guidance is included\nin this release because most non-GAAP adjustments pertain to events that have not yet occurred. It would be unreasonably burdensome to\nforecast, therefore we are unable to provide an accurate estimate.\nCopyright © 2024 Gen Digital Inc. All rights reserved. 28\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Measures and Other Items\nBookings: Bookings are defined as customer orders received that are expected to generate net revenues in the future. We present the operational metric of\nbookings because it reflects customers' demand for our products and services and to assist readers in analyzing our performance in future periods.\nDirect customer count: Direct customers is a metric designed to represent active paid users of our products and solutions who have a direct billing and/or\nregistration relationship with us at the end of the reported period. Average direct customer count presents the average of the total number of direct\ncustomers at the beginning and end of the applicable period.We exclude users on free trials from our direct customer count. Users who have indirectly\npurchased and/or registered for our products or solutions through partners are excluded unless such users convert or renew their subscription directly with us\nor sign up for a paid membership through our web stores or third-party app stores. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable\nestimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products and solutions across\nbrands, platforms, regions, and internal systems, and therefore, calculation methodologies may differ. The methodologies used to measure these metrics\nrequire judgment and are also susceptible to algorithms or other technical errors. We continually seek to improve our estimates of our user base, and these\nestimates are subject to change due to improvements or revisions to our methodology. From time to time, we review our metrics and may discover\ninaccuracies or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical\nmetrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not\nintend to update previously disclosed metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are deemed not material.\nDirect average revenues per user (ARPU): ARPU is calculated as estimated direct customer revenues for the period divided by the average direct customer\ncount for the same period, expressed as a monthly figure. We monitor ARPU because it helps us understand the rate at which we are monetizing our\nconsumer customer base.\nRetention rate: Retention rate is defined as the percentage of direct customers as of the end of the period from one year ago who are still active as of the most\nrecently completed fiscal period. We monitor the retention rate to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies to improve renewals of subscriptions.\n(Unlevered) Free cash flow: Free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. Unlevered free cash\nflow excludes cash interest expense payments, net of payments received through interest rate swap hedges. Free cash flow is not a measure of financial\ncondition under GAAP and does not reflect our future contractual commitments and the total increase or decrease of our cash balance for a given period, and\nthus should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity.\nCopyright © 2024 Gen Digital Inc.

Q2 was another solid quarter of consistently executing on our strategy meeting our commitments for profitable growth while\ncontinuing our investment to meet the long-term consumer needs of ever-expanding digital lives.\nWe delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit bookings growth up 5% and our highest growth rate since the Avast acquisition and a double-digit\nearnings per share growth, up 16%. We also grew our direct paying customers by 400,000 in the quarter, not a record $39.7 million. Those results\nare a testament to the solid disciplined and consistent execution of our team.\nOn top of that, it is also a clear reflection of what we have talked about for many quarters. People are being exposed to an accelerating threat\nenvironment and their awareness is growing with every new breach and scam text or e-mail. Those trends are here to stay and are being enhanced\nby the use or misuse of AI.\nAs consumer awareness grows, we stand ready to empower your digital life with the most innovative and easy-to-use solutions that secure and\nprotect your identity and your returned assets. It is easy to get desensitized to news of yet another breach, but the impact recently is truly staggering.\nIn August, the US National Public data breach exposed an estimated $270 million social security numbers, practically two-third of all social security\nnumbers ever issued leaving one out of three Americans at risk of identity attacks. The scale and the frequency of breaches, along with the\nsophistication and volume of phishing e-mails and scams makes everyone vulnerable.\nAs we shared in our last report around rising election scams, even young adults who are expected to be the severest online are proving to be\nsusceptible at higher rates. This unfortunate reality is a big part of why our team at Gen is still mission-driven. We believe that no matter how good\nthe cyber criminals get, our goal is to give you the tools and the solutions that empower you to live your digital life without worry.\nDelivering digital freedom and peace of mind is no small task. So every day, we are focused on upping our game. Just about a year ago, our threat\nteam and technology detected the growing threats of personalized scams at high volumes and quickly delivered our Genie anti-scam product.\nPowered by AI, Genie was the first embodiment of the future of digital freedom. Not only does it interact with you in an accessible and intuitive\nway, it also continually learns and adapts with every interaction.\nToday, we have over 1.6 million downloads and its overall efficacy is approaching 100%. Genie is a great example of how we continue to put\ninnovative solutions in the hands of consumers but it is just the start. In the coming quarters, we plan to enhance the product and expand this\nanti-scam technology into our core offerings. More to come on that front.\nProtecting consumers from scams is one of the biggest attack vectors, but as I mentioned earlier, breaches pose an entirely different threat and\nare also on rise. Breaches with you, your information and you art assets at risk, and it generally happens through no fault of you own. Data you\nprovided to your favorite stores, your health care provider, you banks and the government is being put on the dark web. And as the breaches\nproliferate, cyber criminals are stitching together different pieces of information to increase their ability to successfully steal your identity or target\nyou for sophisticated and personalized scams. No one is immune. And if you don't believe me, I challenge you to go out and try our free lifelog\ndata exposure scan, and I'm sure you will be surprised at how much of your information is out there and available.\nThat constant growing threat is why we are continuously investing in and innovating around how we keep your financial assets, your personal\ninformation and your reputation safe. No one is better at helping a victim recover from identity theft than LifeLock. We invented the category, and\nwe have a world-class restoration team that helps repair the damage. But we want to also be sure that we can stop since earlier. That's why we\nhave alert algorithm and full spend tracking through financial monitoring features to keep you aware and safe in real time.\nWe recently released credit insights to our large cloud customers as part of our strategy to address the customer needs to keep the finances safe\nonline. This new LifeLock feature provides customers with contextual information to better understand what factors impact their credit score with\nactionable insights to build or improve their credit rating over time. from spend tracking to helping you better manage your subscription spending\nor virtual secure credit card, we see an increase in demand for trust-based services, and will continue to expand what we do for consumers in that\narea. So they feel empowered to manage their finances confidently, achieve financial freedom and thrive in their digital journeys.\n3\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

In Q2, we grew cyber savings bookings over 5%, driven by strong momentum in identity where bookings were up 8%\nyear-over-year. We also drove double-digit growth in new customer acquisitions maintained solid momentum in upselling into our identity\nmemberships and continued expanding our partnership network.\nWith so much opportunity in front of us, we will continue to invest to serve the expanding needs of consumer, whether that be adding to our AI\ncapabilities to better match our services to our customers and deliver more intuitive and engaging experiences from them or through innovation\ninto new and existing products or even expanding our reach to new markets for services like identity theft protection. Even with the most\ncomprehensive solutions in the market, we know we can't rest, so expect us to delivering innovation and more engaging experiences to our\ncustomers.\nWhile we remain focused on the future and innovation, operating with discipline and meeting our commitments are core parts of our Gen DNA.\nOperating KPIs remain very healthy, supporting yet another quarter of double-digit growth in non-GAAP earnings per share, which includes many\nof our investments for long-term growth.\nSince our Investor Day last year, where we laid out our long-term goals of accelerating growth to the mid-single digits and driving non-GAAP EPS\ngrowth of 12% to 15%. We have consistently executed and delivered on our commitments. We are pleased with our Q2 results and excited about\nwhat we can deliver in the future. As a result, we strengthened our annual guidance, and we are making steady progress towards achieving the\nthree year financial goals we shared at our Investor Day last November.\nWe are passionate about our mission to empower and protect every aspect of digital life, and we're confident that our focus on the customers, our\npace of innovation and our disciplined execution will enable us to achieve our goals to drive shareholder value.\nAnd with that, let me pass it on to Natalie to review our financial performance in detail.\nNatalie Derse - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Vincent, and hello, everyone. For today's call, I will walk through our fiscal Q2 2025 results, followed by our outlook for Q3 and full year\nfiscal year 2025. I will focus on non-GAAP financials and year-over-year growth rates, unless otherwise stated. Q2 was another quarter of solid\nexecution with strong financial results at or above the midpoint of our guidance and reflects our 21st consecutive quarter of growth. Q2 bookings\nwere $964 million, up 5% in constant currency and up 4% in USD Cyber Safety bookings, which exclude our legacy business lines, also grew 5%\nyear-over-year in constant currency, our highest growth rate since the Avast acquisition.\nThis quarter, there was a surge in consumer awareness, interest and demand for identity theft protection after the National Public data breach.\nThis is when our brand awareness and vast LifeLock protection offerings really cut through and we drove stronger customer acquisition and\nbookings as a result, helping to shore up the higher bookings growth rate in the quarter.\nMoving to revenue. Total Q2 revenue was $974 million, up 3% in USD and constant currency. Cyber Safety revenue grew 4% year-over-year, driven\nby broad-based growth across our consumer security and identity and privacy business lines. Stable growth in our security business lines reflects\nthe success of our cross-sell program as our Norton 360 security customers continue to add more adjacent offerings, and we drive improved\nmonetization. Identity and privacy growth was more pronounced with faster growth in our Norton 360 with LifeLock product as consumers\nincreasingly adopt comprehensive cyber safety membership with identity solutions.\nDirect revenue was $860 million, up 3%, supported by improvements across our key performance metrics of direct customers, ARPU and retention.\nLet me share some specifics. A key ingredient to our growth strategy is driving net new customers. And in Q2, we expanded our customer base for\nthe fifth consecutive quarter, increasing to $39.7 million up $389,000 sequentially and up over $1.1 million year-over-year.\nWe continue to leverage our broad range of marketing channels and vast product portfolio dynamically shifting and increasing marketing investments\nbased on demand, while optimizing our sites to drive improved traffic conversion.\n4\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

On monetization, our monthly direct ARPU was\nUSD7.26, up $0.03 sequentially and up $0.01 compared to last year's results. Note that FX helped this metric by $0.02 sequentially but had no\nimpact year-over-year.\nOperationally, ARPU remains stable to slightly up across our customer cohorts by brand and by market. As we grow our customer base, we have\ndemonstrated the ability to further monetize after their first purchase, whether through cross-selling complementary products or upselling to\nhigher tier memberships, both avenues providing additional customer value and enhanced cyber safety protection coverage. Our efforts to better\ncustomize and personalize offerings at the right moments of truth are working. And as we add new features and expand our portfolio, we will\ncontinue to feed this flywheel. The expanded values and services provided to our customers is also reflected in the retention increases to date.\nIn Q2, our direct retention rate was 78%, in line with the prior quarter and improving by 1 point year-over-year, steadily progressing towards our\ngoal of 80%. While each point of retention will get harder to achieve as we continue to drive new customer growth, our teams are focused on\ndriving gains at the cohort and product level.\nAnd as Gen stack gets rolled out to more customers, we are driving better targeting and in-product messaging with the goal to create more\npersonalized customer experiences that will in turn drive higher customer loyalty, retention and increased lifetime value. As we look forward, we\nwill continue to focus on keeping our already high retention rates in our Norton and LifeLock brand stable and drive increases with our mobile\ncustomers and our Avast brands.\nTurning to our partner business. Partner revenue was $102 million in Q2, up 7% year-over-year as reported and up 8% in constant currency, as we\ngrow our identity and privacy offerings. Our employee benefits channel continues to scale, helping over 10,000 companies protect their employees\nfrom identity and cyber threats.\nAs consumer awareness of identity theft grows and companies turn to offering more comprehensive benefits to their employees, our pipeline is\nstrengthening. Our telco partnerships are also helping us scale our identity membership offerings internationally, leveraging the partner's scale\nand broad customer base to drive adoption in targeted expansion markets.\nAnd as consumers increasingly gravitate towards identity and privacy solutions, our private browsers have also been an accelerator for partner\ngrowth as we see strong adoption in our customer base. Across our diverse set of partner channels, we are making steady progress towards $0.5\nbillion in annual partner revenue over the next years. Rounding out our revenue, our legacy business lines contributed $12 million this quarter,\ndown from $16 million in the prior year. As a reminder, we expect our legacy revenue to continue declining double digits year-over-year and\nrepresents approximately 1% of our total revenue.\nTurning to profitability. Q2 operating income was $567 million, up 4% year-over-year and translating to an operating margin of 58.2%. As I noted\nearlier, we're making focused investments to capitalize on the growth opportunities we see in the market, and that's reflected in our strong first\nhalf booking results. We continue to invest in marketing across all channels with an always-on optimization of existing funds and deployment of\nincremental funds to expand our customer base and accelerate growth.\nWe're also investing in R&D and our longer-term foundational technology capabilities while launching new offerings to fortify our comprehensive\ncyber safety product portfolio and stay ahead of emerging threats. And as we've demonstrated in prior quarters, we will continue to fund these\ninvestments through our operating leverage and by operating lean across the G&A organizations now at a record low of approximately 2% of\nrevenue.\nBuilding on the strength of our KPIs, along with our solid execution against expectations in the first half, we will continue to invest in our business\nwith the same disciplined approach as we focus on driving sustainable mid-single-digit growth. Q2 net income was $336 million, up 12%\nyear-over-year. Diluted EPS was $0.54 for the quarter, up 16% year-over-year, in line with our guidance. Interest expense related to our debt was\n$142 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate remained steady at 22%, and our ending share count was $622 million, down $22 million year-over-year,\nreflecting the impact of share repurchases.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Q2 ending cash balance was $737 million. We are supported by over $2.2 billion of total liquidity,\nconsisting of our ending Q2 cash balance and $1.5 billion of revolver. Q2 operating cash flow was $158 million, and free cash flow was $156 million,\nwhich included approximately $70 million of cash interest payments this quarter.\nAs a reminder, Q2 is seasonally high, our highest use of cash given the concentration of tax payments that are due in the quarter. And as a result,\nwe did not purchase any stock or pay down additional debt this quarter. Also important to note, due to the timing of our quarter end being on\nSeptember 27, this year, our Q2 ending balance does not reflect our $89 million in cash interest and $58 million paid for our maturity schedule on\nSeptember 30.\nAs we look forward, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy, returning 100% of excess free cash flow to shareholders, maintaining\nour dividend and balancing our capital allocation to both debt paydown and opportunistic share buyback.\nIn the quarter, we paid $77 million to shareholders in the form of a regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per common share. For Q3 fiscal 2025, the\nBoard of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per common share to be paid on December 11, 2024 for all shareholders of record\nas of the close of business on November 18, 2024.\nSince the start of fiscal year 2023, we have paid down over $2 billion worth of debt and have deployed a total of $1.6 billion of share repurchases\nover that time period. With our strong cash flow generation, we will continue to deploy our capital to achieve the long-term objectives laid out in\nour Analyst Day.\nNow turning to our Q3 and fiscal '25 outlook. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $980 million to $990 million, translating to\napproximately 4% growth in cyber safety. And Q3 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.56. For fiscal year 2025, we are strengthening\nour prior guidance range and now expect full year revenue in the range of $3.905 billion to $3.93 billion translating to 3% to 4% growth in cyber\nsafety, expressed in constant currency, supported by expected cyber safety bookings growth of 4% to 5%.\nWe have raised the lower end of our EPS guidance and now expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.18 to $2.23 per share representing an\nannual increase of 12% to 15% in constant currency and in line with the EPS growth objectives we shared last November.\nIn summary, our Q2 results keep us on target for our 2025 plan, and we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term goals. Our key performance\nindicators continue to trend in the right direction. We are executing our plan and our strategic growth framework provides us guide points along\nthe journey.\nAs always, thank you for your time today, and I will now turn the call back to the operator to take your questions. Operator?\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions)\nAndrew Nowinski, Wells Fargo.\nAndrew Nowinski - Wells Fargo Securities LLC - Analyst\nGood afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the strong Q2 results here.\n6\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Welcome to the call.\nAndrew Nowinski - Wells Fargo Securities LLC - Analyst\nThank you very much on. I wanted to dig into the net adds this quarter, which I thought were very impressive. I mean it seems like it's almost a\nguarantee that every adult in the US now has their personal data on the dark web thanks to all the breaches we saw this summer, including that\nnational public data breach. So do you think the net adds will improve, particularly in the US going forward? Because I think you said it was more\ninfluenced by the international growth this quarter.\nVincent Pilette - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Executive Officer, Director\nSo definitely, the National Data Breach helped making people more aware of the risks -- but this quarter, we grew our cohorts across all of our\nbrands and across the continent balls, Americas and Europe. So we've seen kind of a broad base. Granted, it was a little bit more pronounced in\nthe identity and in the US for that reason. And you're right that today, we believe that about one American out of three has enough of the personal\ndata out there on the dark web for any criminals to stitch together a profile and do an identity test. We know ideally, -- we know that everybody\nshould be protected and that the awareness is something that we'll expand to work on to ensure that everyone understands the risk. It's a little bit\nlike a an insurance service, if you want, you need to have a first catastrophe to never skimp protection.\nAndrew Nowinski - Wells Fargo Securities LLC - Analyst\nGot it. And then I wanted to -- maybe just a clarification. I think last quarter, you talked about the Norton cross-sell penetration had increased to\n20%. I didn't catch it this quarter if you gave that. But I was really wondering also did you see an improvement in the LifeLock attach rate or customers\nupgrading to that higher-end membership that includes LifeLock this quarter given all the breach activity?\nNatalie Derse - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Thanks for the question. This is Natalie. So for sure, we saw increase in our cross-sell penetration. It's been a a growth driver for us and with\nus for several consecutive quarters. We laid that out as one of the five-to-five levers of what you have to believe for sustainable accelerated growth\nin the mid-single digits. And we definitely needed and wanted to show you guys and share with you guys what our starting point was and the\nmilestone achievements that we would need to achieve mid-single-digit rate of growth over the long-term.\nSo it won't be a specific metric that we give you every single quarter, but absolutely consistent performance and driver of our -- not only our\nbookings growth, but our ARPU coming from cross-sell. And then from a LifeLock attach rate, yes, I mean you probably heard it more than a handful\nof times in my script because the LifeLock customers are such high value, highly retaining customers for us -- this has been a very healthy quarter\nfor our business. We did see more LifeLock acquisition saw more up-sell into membership tiers with the LifeLock identity protection value. And we\nsaw acquisition into higher tiered LifeLock offerings this quarter, especially even more fueled by that NPD bridge and the increased demand in the\nmarket.\nAndrew Nowinski - Wells Fargo Securities LLC - Analyst\nGot it. Thank you. Keep up the good work. Thank you.\nVincent Pilette - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Executive Officer, Director\nThank you for your questions.\n7\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

This is Ryan Parley on for Saket. And Natalie, maybe first for you. That was some helpful commentary just around the buybacks\nand de-levering activity this quarter, understanding the cash constrictions. Just going forward, as we take a look at the next near and mid-term, --\ncan you talk about how you're going to be balancing buybacks and de-levering over the next few quarters?\nNatalie Derse - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I would say it's going to be a consistent approach that we've taken to the last handful of quarters. Of course, we all know what's happening in\nthe debt market and the cost of debt now is very different than the environment than we were in a year ago. But both are very important for us in\nterms of capital allocation strategy. We'll strike the right balance quarter in, quarter out, not a specific percentage because we flex based on the\nmacroeconomic indicators.\nSo everything from the cost of debt, the timing of the cash, Q2 is our highest use of cash. So we were largely constricted in terms of what else we\ncould do for additional capital allocation -- but we also know we're highly cash generators. So the back half of capital allocation will be very, very\nbalanced and very interesting.\nUnidentified Participant\nGot it. That's super helpful. Maybe for my follow-up, I'd just love to dig into one other part of net adds. That was really interesting to see. Could you\ntalk about first year retention and how that's been trending? Because I know we talked about that at Analyst Day. Just what do you think is -- are\nthere any improvements there? And how has that been trending?\nNatalie Derse - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYes. So our first year retention rate is very consistent to up. And I'd point that to our continuously innovative product road map, the range of values\nand services that we are bringing to market is very, very competitive, very relevant and highly in demand and we make sure that we're not only\nbringing great products and services to market, but that we're competitively priced and our messaging and our personalization is a cut through\nto the customers as possible so that they understand what we can be for them in their ever increasing risk of cyber safety. And so yes, we see very,\nvery solid results in first year -- in all of our retention rates, which is why we've been able to scale up to 78% overall. But yes, the first year renewal\nrates are higher than they have been in the past.\nUnidentified Participant\nVery helpful. Thanks, guys.\nNatalie Derse - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nThank you.\n8\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

You talked about Genie AI I know you -- so with -- I think you mentioned, I\nthink it was like 1.6, 1.7 downloads. But Vincent, in your commentary, you called out, I think, so more to come on that front, but will enable debt\nAI across your core offerings. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about your kind of what the aspirations are there in terms of putting that across\nthe platform? And then maybe explain to us the monetization opportunities or if it's more of a resin tool just to kind of be more competitive. Just\nhelp us kind of balance those,\nVincent Pilette - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Executive Officer, Director\nYes. It will be all of lever, but let me explain right. So definitely, we can see a very strong rise in scam, personalized scam and volume personalized\nscans the use of the eye. And when we came out with Genie we're singly focused on really developing our LLM to be able to spot those cans and\nthen help our consumers detect what is a scam and what is not. And we did that also is a conversational interface, you can also decide on what's\nthe with scam.\nWe've had 1.6 million downloads very strong models, and I think we're now ready to move that into our overall portfolio. We'll start first with the\nNorton 360 membership being the core Genie assistant or the anti-scam assistant in the first three level of our Norton 360 plan. And then we'll\nramp up in features moving from tech scams to voice scams, to call blocks to scam insurance through the different plan, if you want all the way to\nNorton 360 with LifeLock. So that's coming now.\nThe first path of monetization is to help our customers to move and upgrade to the next level of plan that not only provide the current features of\nsafety, but extend to all of those I've just mentioned. And there will be a Genie Pro cross-sell, if you want for those who wants to stand to the old\nplan and just want to have a stand-alone anti-scam tool.\nPeter Levine - Evercore ISI - Analyst\nAnd maybe the second question or follow-up here is benefits enrollment. I know this was the quarter I think most would sign up for it. So maybe\ncan you just give us an update on how that pipeline kind of closed off for the quarter versus expectations? And then kind of if you think about how\nthis season ended, any changes that you're making to the go to market to your partners to kind of accelerate that for next year?\nVincent Pilette - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Executive Officer, Director\nSo we continue to grow our employee benefit channel double digit. It's both growing on acquiring new accounts, but also we're working with\neach account and putting the right marketing and communication engagement materials to have more sign-ups in those accounts. We've seen\ngrowth through the last few quarters. We have a very strong funnel. We've always had a very strong funnel. Now it comes more to another jump\nin growth, if you want.\nWhen it comes to the enrollment view where we can subscribe more customers if you want within those accounts. We obviously integrate everything\nwe see the strong funnel and the activity in marketing I've just mentioned into our forecast. And I think we feel very good about the continued\ndevelopment of that channel in which we -- and are also new products and go all the way to a full reputation Defender service for executives and\nbelow.\n9\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Are these agreements when you go into a company and offer the benefits, is it an enterprise agreement? Or how does\nthat get priced versus the consumer model? Just curious in terms of the pricing model versus the...\nVincent Pilette - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Executive Officer, Director\nAbsolutely. So the pricing is kind of an enterprise agreement, but it's on a perceived basis. It either is fully sponsored or partially sponsored by the\nemployer benefit plans and the pricing is slightly below, but not materially below what you charge for the consumers.\nOperator\nTomer Zilberman, Bank of America.\nTomer Zilberman - Bank of America - Analyst\nGreat. Hi, guys. I wanted to go back to the direct customer net adds. So when we look at the $389,000, how much of that would you say is coming\nfrom the ads of international and mobile versus what you said the better identity sales on the back of the national data breach. And really, what\nI'm trying to ask here is what do you think is the normalized customer growth in the remainder of the year?\nNatalie Derse - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nThis is Natalie. So I'll take that one. The majority of our customer count net adds sequentially has consistently been coming from, as we expand\nand broaden solutions available on mobile as well as our international market expansion. So both of those have been consistent levers and consistent\ndrivers of growth for us in customer acquisition as we expand and increase the penetration, increase the value proposition that we've got with our\nmobile users. And that stayed consistent in Q2. And then on top of that, we saw the increased demand coming from the identity offerings. On a\ngo-forward basis, we it is very, very critical for us to continuously focus on healthy customer acquisition.\nWe do that on a global basis across all of our brands across all of our platforms. And we will continue to expand internationally as we identify new\nmarkets of healthy customer acquisition -- and yes, we're just getting started in terms of expanding the value proposition and the engagement\nthat we've got with the ever-growing mobile users and customers in our portfolio. In addition, we will continue to foster all of the brands across\nour portfolio. All of them are critical.\nAnd on a go-forward basis, we're going to be balancing our investments, whether it's product, the product road map and the technology solutions\nthat we bring as well as combined with the different marketing channels that we've got to optimize a healthy customer acquisition that feeds our\nflywheel, feeds our increase in ARPU, feeds to cross-sell, feeds or upsell and therefore, feeds our retention and book -- accelerating bookings growth.\nTomer Zilberman - Bank of America - Analyst\nGot it. And maybe as a follow-up, looking at the guidance raise this year for the full year, I saw in the quarter, your negative currency impact went\ndown to about $1 million from $7 million over the last few quarters. How much of that is driving your guidance raise versus just the better business\ntrends that you're seeing?\nNatalie Derse - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYes, it's immaterial for us. And then when we set our -- when we revise our guide, we just use the current currency rates that we all know as of right\nnow. We don't predict or project any currency fluctuations.\n10\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Okay. Thank you.\nOperator\nHamza Fodderwala, Morgan Stanley.\nHamza Fodderwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC - Analyst\nGood evening. Thank you for taking my question. So I wanted a solid quarter in terms of top line, really strong sort of record net adds. I wanted to\nhave a question on the cost side of the equation. The EBIT margin, I think, was slightly higher than it was in recent quarters. Just curious on the cost\nside, what are you seeing in terms of advertising costs. I know in the past that kind of gone up and down. So I'm curious what you're seeing currently?\nNatalie Derse - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYes, it varies across all the brands, quite honestly, in all the different channels. And we've got such a diverse set of channels and increasing marketing\nspend going to those channels. I think you're specifically talking about the gross margin rate. And yes, we do see shifts across our marketing\nportfolio. We optimize for healthy ROI customer acquisition, and we leverage the different channel diversification that we've got.\nIn terms of what's -- there is different accounting treatment, depending on what marketing channels there are. So I would encourage you to consider\nthat when you think about the gross margin versus the op margin versus the EBITDA margin, -- and that's why we're able to hold the operating\nmargin so consistently quarter-over-quarter. It's just P&L profile of where the marketing channel expense for this quarter actually hit.\nHamza Fodderwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC - Analyst\nMaybe can I be more specific in the direct-to-consumer side of the business, how would you say advertising costs have been trending in the last\nfew quarters up or down?\nNatalie Derse - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So overall, I would say it is definitely getting more competitive. Now keep in mind, our tax by brand and tax by channel are very, very different.\nAnd so overall, it's stable to up in terms of cost of acquisition. But when you think about a side by side and when we talk about our business\nsequentially, when we talk about taking and leveraging the increased market demand for LifeLock, that's obviously going to be a much, much\nhigher absolute dollar [CAC] to acquire that much higher value customer than if you were to think about a lower AV security customer add in a\nnew growth market internationally.\nHamza Fodderwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC - Analyst\nGot it. So it's a higher lifetime value subscriber, but maybe initially might be a little bit higher CAC. Does that make sense. Thank you.\nOperator\nDan Bergstrom, RBC.\n11\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

And then it looks like the key assumptions moved\nup to 4% to 5% from 3% to 5% last quarter. Maybe just what could that 5% portend for revenue growth over the next year? Should we think of\nmaybe the difference between bookings and revenue growth, it's maybe narrowing or maybe solidifying a potential around revenue acceleration?\nJust any further thoughts around accelerating bookings growth here?\nNatalie Derse - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYes. A large -- the majority of our portfolio or our book of business is going to be ratable. And so it's about rolling off the balance sheet relatively\nconsistently. We don't have a ton of seasonality in terms of the size of our quarters. And so largely speaking, super high level, it will roll off over the\nnext 12-months. We do have our monthly subscribers, which is still a small share of our business, you would see that hitting bookings and revenue\nin the same period because we recognize the revenue as we deliver on the service so monthly. But largely speaking, our portfolio and our book of\nbusiness is on an annual subscription and we -- the majority of that is ratable over the next quarters.\nMatt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst\nThat's helpful. And then maybe a little more on any action that you maybe undertook outline that social security number breach. I mean, did you\nchange marketing messaging channels? It seems like you had pretty prescient timing around the personal data exposure product. Any specifics\nyou may have done to lean into it a little further?\nNatalie Derse - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nYes. We did a full reallocation in terms of assessing where to put the marketing dollars a reallocation into the LifeLock business for sure in the\nbrands and services. And with that, we did a healthy balance across the different channels to go where the demand was. There's a lot of demand\nfor identity, obviously, in SEO as well as paid search. And then also the affiliate channels really helped us with referral traffic to bring them to our\nplatform on the LifeLock side.\nMatt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst\nThat's great. Thank you.\nNatalie Derse - Gen Digital Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you for your questions. That concludes our Q&A session.

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNote 1. Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\nBusiness\nGen Digital Inc. is a global company powering Digital Freedom with a family of trusted consumer brands including Norton,\nAvast, LifeLock, Avira, AVG, ReputationDefender and CCleaner. Our cyber safety portfolio provides protection across multiple\nchannels and geographies, including security and performance management, identity protection, and online privacy. Our\ntechnology platforms bring together software and service capabilities into comprehensive and easy-to-use products and solutions\nacross our brands. We have also evolved beyond traditional cyber safety to offer adjacent trust-based solutions, including digital\nidentity and access management, digital reputation management, and restoration support services.\nBasis of presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information. In the opinion of\nmanagement, the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments, consisting only of normal\nrecurring items, except as otherwise noted, necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and\ncash flows for the interim periods. These unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction\nwith the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nMarch 29, 2024. The results of operations for the three and six months ended September 27, 2024 are not necessarily indicative\nof the results expected for the entire fiscal year.\nFiscal calendar\nWe have a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to March 31. Unless otherwise stated, references to three and\nsix month periods in this report relate to fiscal periods ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023. The three and six\nmonths ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023 each consisted of 13 and 26 weeks, respectively. Our 2025 fiscal\nyear consists of 52 weeks and ends on March 28, 2025.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and accompanying Notes. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, valuation of business\ncombinations including acquired intangible assets and goodwill, deferred revenue, loss contingencies, the recognition and\nmeasurement of current and deferred income taxes, including assessment of unrecognized tax benefits, and valuation of assets\nand liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management determines these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience\nand on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Third-party valuation specialists are also utilized for certain\nestimates. Actual results could differ from such estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in\nthe current economic environment as a result of macroeconomic factors such as inflation, fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency, changes in interest rates, ongoing and new geopolitical\nconflicts, and such differences may be material to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSignificant accounting policies\nWith the exception of those discussed in Note 2, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies\nas of and for the three and six months ended September 27, 2024, as compared to the significant accounting policies described\nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024.\nRevision of Prior Period Financial Statements\nHistorically, we had a practice of recognizing revenue for certain groups of customer renewals on the successful billing date,\nrather than the renewal start date. This practice was instituted to align with our system which was configured and implemented\nbased on payment confirmation from e-commerce partners. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we changed the practice to\nrecognize revenue for these groups on the renewal start date. We concluded that the impact of this change is not material to any\npreviously issued annual or interim financial statements; however, we have revised previously reported financial information. This\ncorrection will also be reflected in future filings, as applicable.\nWe have corrected this error in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 29, 2024 by\nincreasing contract liabilities for $78 million, increasing other long-term assets for $21 million and decreasing retained earnings\n(accumulated deficit) for $57 million. The Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three months ended\nSeptember 29, 2023 included a decrease to net revenues of $3 million and a decrease to income tax expense (benefit) of\n$1 million. The Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the six months ended September 29, 2023 included a\ndecrease to net revenues of $6 million and a decrease to income tax expense (benefit) of $2 million.\nNote 2. Recent Accounting Standards\n9\nTable of Contents\nRecently issued authoritative guidance not yet adopted\nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. In November 2023, the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidance to update reportable segment disclosure requirements,\nprimarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess segment\nperformance. The ASU also clarifies circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss\nand provide new segment disclosure requirement for entities with a single reportable segment. This is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We do not expect\nthe adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.\nASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued\nnew guidance to update income tax disclosure requirements, requiring disaggregated information about an entity’s effective tax\nrate reconciliation as well as income taxes paid. This is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are\ncurrently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and\ndisclosures.\nThere have been no other material changes in recently issued or adopted accounting standards from those disclosed in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024.\nAlthough there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB that we have adopted or\nwill adopt, as applicable, we do not believe any of these accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on\nour Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.\nNote 3. Assets Held for Sale\nAssets held for sale\nDuring fiscal 2023, we determined land and buildings in Dublin, Ireland, which were previously reported as property and\nequipment, qualified as held for sale.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we completed the sale of certain land and buildings in Dublin, Ireland, for cash\nconsideration of $13 million, net of selling costs, and recognized a gain on sale of $4 million. The remaining land and building in\nDublin, Ireland, remains held for sale. We have taken into consideration the current real estate values and demand and continue\nto execute plans to sell the remaining property. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we recognized an immaterial\nimpairment representing the difference between the fair value less cost to sell and the carrying value of the remaining land and\nbuilding in Dublin, Ireland. As of September 27, 2024, this property remains classified as assets held for sale.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we determined certain land and buildings in Tettnang, Germany, which were\npreviously reported as property and equipment, net as of March 29, 2024, now qualifies as held for sale classification. As a\nresult, we reclassified the aggregate of $12 million carrying value from property and equipment, net to assets held for sale in our\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Upon reclassification, we recognized an immaterial impairment representing the\ndifference between the fair value less cost to sell and the carrying value of the property.\nDuring the three and six months ended September 27, 2024, we recognized immaterial impairments on our held for sale\nproperties, which was included in Other Income (expense), net in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations,\nbecause the fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying value of our properties.\nNote 4. Revenues\nContract liabilities\nDuring the three and six months ended September 27, 2024, we recognized $733 million and $1,261 million from the contract\nliabilities balances as of June 28, 2024 and March 29, 2024, respectively. During the three and six months ended September 29,\n2023, we recognized $705 million and $1,232 million from the contract liabilities balances as of June 30, 2023 and March 31,\n2023, respectively.\nRemaining performance obligations\nRemaining performance obligations represent contracted revenue that has not been recognized, which include contract\nliabilities and amounts that will be billed and recognized as revenue in future periods. As of September 27, 2024, we had $1,232\nmillion of remaining performance obligations, excluding customer deposit liabilities of $595 million, of which we expect to\nrecognize approximately 94% as revenue over the next 12 months.\nSee Note 16 for tabular disclosures of disaggregated revenue by solution and geographic region.\n10\nTable of Contents\nNote 5.

Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\nFor financial instruments measured at fair value, fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value,\nwe consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market\nparticipants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\nThe three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices\nin less active markets or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash\nflows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially\nthe full term of the assets or liabilities.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of\nassets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value\nmeasurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.\nAssets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis\nThe following table summarizes our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nSeptember 27, 2024 March 29, 2024\n(In millions) Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Fair Value Level 1 Level 2\nAssets:\nMoney market funds $ 154 $ 154 $ — $ 438 $ 438 $ —\nInterest rate swaps — — — 16 — 16\nTotal assets $ 154 $ 154 $ — $ 454 $ 438 $ 16\nLiabilities:\nInterest rate swaps $ 3 $ — $ 3 $ — $ — $ —\nTotal liabilities $ 3 $ — $ 3 $ — $ — $ —\nFinancial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include our non-marketable equity investments and long-\nterm debt.\nNon-marketable equity investments\nAs of September 27, 2024 and March 29, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments was $140\nmillion and $136 million, respectively.\nCurrent and long-term debt\nAs of September 27, 2024 and March 29, 2024, the total fair value of our current and long-term fixed rate debt was $2,650\nmillion and $2,624 million, respectively. The fair value of our variable rate debt approximated their carrying value. The fair values\nof all our debt obligations were based on Level 2 inputs.\nNote 8. Leases\nWe lease certain facilities, equipment and data center co-locations under operating leases that expire on various dates\nthrough fiscal 2033. Our leases generally have terms that range from 1 year to 9 years for our facilities, 1 year to 4 years for\nequipment and 1 year to 7 years for data center co-locations. Some of our leases contain renewal options, escalation clauses,\nrent concessions and leasehold improvement incentives.\nThe following summarizes our lease costs:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease costs $ 4 $ 2 $ 7 $ 6\nShort-term lease costs — 1 1 1\nVariable lease costs 2 2 2 3\nTotal lease costs $ 6 $ 5 $ 10 $ 10\nOther information related to our operating leases was as follows:\nSeptember 27,\n2024 March 29, 2024\nWeighted-average remaining lease term 5.0 years 4.6 years\nWeighted-average discount rate 5.60 % 5.35 %\n14\nTable of Contents\nSee Note 6 for cash flow information related to our operating leases.\nAs of September 27, 2024, the maturities of our lease liabilities by fiscal year are as follows:\n(In millions)\nRemainder of 2025 $ 8\n2026 16\n2027 15\n2028 9\n2029 8\nThereafter 13\nTotal lease payments 69\nLess: Imputed interest (9)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 60\nNote 9.

The Bridge Loan was undrawn and\nimmediately terminated upon the close of the acquisition of Avast. The Credit Agreement provides that we have the right at any\ntime, subject to customary conditions, to request incremental revolving commitments and incremental term loans up to an\nunlimited amount, subject to certain customary conditions precedent and other provisions. The lenders under these facilities will\nnot be under any obligation to provide any such incremental loans or commitments. We drew down the aggregate principal\namounts of the Term A Facility and Term B Facility to finance the cash consideration payable for our acquisition of Avast and to\nfully repay the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the existing credit facilities at the time. The Credit Agreement\nreplaced the existing credit facilities upon the close of the transaction. The Revolving Facility and Term A Facility will mature in\nSeptember 2027, and the Term Facility B will mature in September 2029; the senior credit facilities remain senior secured.\nOn June 5, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment with certain financial institutions under the Credit Agreement, as\namended (Amended Credit Agreement). The First Amendment repriced our Term B Facility interest rate from the applicable\nbenchmark rate plus CSA plus 2.0% to the applicable benchmark rate plus 1.75%. Other than as described above, the Revolving\nFacility and the term loan facilities under the First Amendment continue to have the same terms as provided under the Credit\nAgreement.\nThe principal amounts of Term Facility A must be repaid in quarterly installments on the last business day of each calendar\nquarter equal to 1.25% of the aggregate principal amount as of the date of the Amended Credit Agreement. The principal\namounts of Term Facility B must be repaid in quarterly installments on the last business day of each calendar quarter equal to\n0.25% of the aggregate principal amount as of the date of the Amended Credit Agreement. Quarterly installment payments\ncommenced on March 31, 2023. We may voluntarily repay outstanding principal balances under the Revolving Facility and Term\nloan facilities without penalty or premium. As of September 27, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under our Revolving\nFacility; however, from time to time we utilize letters of credits as part of our ordinary course of business. Letters of credit reduce\nour Revolving Facility commitment amounts. As of September 27, 2024, we had $10 million in letters of credit.\nInterest on our Term A facility borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement, can be based on a base rate or the SOFR at\nour election. Based on our debt ratings and our consolidated leverage ratios as determined in accordance with the Amended\nCredit Agreement, loans borrowed bear interest, in the case of base rate loans, at a per annum rate equal to the applicable base\nrate plus CSA plus a margin ranging from 0.125% to 0.75%, and in the case of the SOFR loans, SOFR, as adjusted for statutory\nreserves, plus a margin ranging from 1.125% to 1.75%.\nDebt covenant compliance\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants.\nEach of the Revolving Facility and Term A Facility are subject to a covenant that we maintain a consolidated leverage ratio less\nthan or equal to (i) 6.0 to 1.0 from the second quarter of fiscal 2023 through the last day of the second quarter of fiscal 2024, (ii)\n5.75 to 1.0 following the last day of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 through the last day of the second quarter of fiscal 2025\nand (iii) 5.25 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter thereafter; provided that such maximum consolidated leverage ratio will increase to\n5.75 to 1.0 for the four fiscal quarters ending immediately should we acquire property, business or assets in an aggregate\namount greater than $250 million.\nIn addition, the Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default under which our payment obligations may\nbe accelerated, including, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or other amounts when due, inaccuracy of\nrepresentations and warranties, violation of certain covenants, payment and acceleration cross defaults with certain other\nindebtedness, certain undischarged judgments, bankruptcy, insolvency or inability to pay debts, change of control, the\noccurrence of certain events related to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Company\nexperiencing a change of control. As of September 27, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants.\nSenior notes\nOn February 9, 2017, we issued $1,100 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.0% Senior Notes due April 15, 2025 (the\n5.0% Senior Notes). The 5.0% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on\nApril 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2017. On or after April 15, 2020, we may redeem some or all of\nthe 5.0% Senior Notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the supplemental indenture, plus accrued and unpaid\ninterest.\nOn September 19, 2022, we issued two series of senior notes, consisting of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2027 and 7.125%\nSenior Notes due 2030, for an aggregate principal of $1,500 million. They are senior unsecured obligations that rank equally in\nright of payment with all of our existing and future senior, unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and may be redeemed at any\ntime, subject to the make-whole provisions contained in the applicable indenture relating to such series of notes. Interest on\nthese series of notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 31 and September 30 for both the 6.75% Senior Notes and\n7.125% Senior Notes, commencing on March 31, 2023. The First Call Dates of the 6.75% Senior Notes due 2027 and 7.125%\nSenior Notes due 2030 are September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2025, respectively. On and after the applicable First Call\nDates, we may redeem the notes of a series at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a set\nredemption price.\n16\nTable of Contents\nNote 10. Derivatives\nOur primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow associated with changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates and interest rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of\nadverse foreign exchange rate and interest rate movements. We do not use our derivative instruments for speculative trading\npurposes. By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates, we\nare exposed to credit risk; however, we mitigate this risk by entering into hedging instruments with highly rated institutions that\ncan be expected to fully perform under the terms of the applicable contracts.\nForeign currency exchange forward contracts\nWe conduct business in numerous currencies throughout our worldwide operations, and our entities hold monetary assets or\nliabilities, earn revenues, or incur costs in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency. As a result, we are exposed to\nforeign exchange gains or losses, which impacts our operating results. As part of our foreign currency risk mitigation strategy, we\nhave entered into monthly foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposure. These forward\ncontracts are not designated as hedging instruments. We do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely\noffsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates.\nInterest rate swap\nIn March 2023, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate risks associated with the variable interest rate of\nour Term A Facility. These pay-fixed, receive-floating rate interest rate swaps have the economic effect of hedging the variability\nof forecasted interest payments until their maturity on March 31, 2026. Pursuant to the agreements, we have effectively\nconverted $1 billion of our variable rate borrowings under Term A Facility to fixed rates, with $500 million at a fixed rate of 3.762%\nand $500 million at a fixed rate of 3.55%.\nThese arrangements are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and as such, we will recognize the\nchanges in the fair value of these interest rate swaps in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), and the\nperiodic settlements or accrued settlements of the swap will be recognized within or against interest expense in our Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. Cash flows related to these hedges are classified under operating activities in our\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nSummary of derivative instruments\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding derivative instruments as of September 27, 2024 and March 29, 2024:\nFair Value of Derivative Fair Value of Derivative\nNotional Amount Assets Liabilities\nSeptember March 29, September March 29, September March 29,\n(In millions) 27, 2024 2024 27, 2024 2024 27, 2024 2024\nForeign exchange contracts not\ndesignated as hedging instrument (1) $ 324 $ 345 $ — $ — $ — $ —\nInterest rate swap contracts designated\nas cash flow hedge 1,000 1,000 — 16 3 —\nTotal $ 1,324 $ 1,345 $ — $ 16 $ 3 $ —\n(1) The fair values of the foreign exchange contracts are less than $1 million as of September 27, 2024 and March 29, 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the effect of our cash flow hedges on AOCI during the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow\nhedge $ 15 $ (10) $ 11 $ (32)\nThe related gain (loss) recognized in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations was as follows:\nCondensed\nConsolidated\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nStatements of\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29, Operations\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Classification\nForeign exchange contracts\nnot designated as hedging Other income\ninstrument $ 5 $ (6) $ 2 $ (9) (expense), net\nInterest rate swap contracts\ndesignated as cash flow hedge 4 4 8 7 Interest expense\nTotal $ 9 $ (2) $ 10 $ (2)\nAs of September 27, 2024, we estimate that less than $1 million of net deferred gains related to our interest rate hedges will\nbe recognized in earnings over the next 12 months.\n17\nTable of Contents\nNote 11. Restructuring and Other Costs\nOur restructuring and other costs consist primarily of severance and termination benefits, contract cancellation charges, asset\nwrite-offs and impairments and other exit and disposal costs. Severance costs generally include severance payments,\noutplacement services, health insurance coverage and legal costs. Contract cancellation charges primarily include penalties for\nearly termination of contracts and write-offs of related prepaid assets. Other exit and disposal costs include costs to exit and\nconsolidate facilities in connection with restructuring events. Separation costs primarily consist of consulting costs incurred in\nconnection with our divestitures.\nSeptember 2022 Plan\nIn connection with our acquisition of Avast, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the September 2022 Plan)\nto realize cost savings and operational synergies, which became effective upon the close of acquisition on September 12, 2022.\nActions under this plan include the reduction of our workforce, contract terminations, facilities closures, and the sale of\nunderutilized facilities as well as stock-based compensation charges for accelerated equity awards to certain terminated\nemployees. We expect that we will incur total costs up to $150 million following the completion of the acquisition. These actions\nare expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2025. As of September 27, 2024, we have incurred costs of $126 million\nrelated to the September 2022 Plan.\nRestructuring and other costs summary\nOur restructuring and other costs are presented in the table below:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSeverance and termination benefit costs $ 2 $ 11 $ 1 $ 22\nContract cancellation charges — 1 — 2\nStock-based compensation charges — 1 — 1\nOther exit and disposal costs 1 4 1 9\nTotal restructuring and other costs $ 3 $ 17 $ 2 $ 34\nNote 12.

Stockholders' Equity\nDividends\nOn October 30, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.125 per share of common\nstock to be paid in December 2024. All shares of common stock issued and outstanding and all restricted stock units (RSUs) and\nperformance-based restricted stock units (PRUs) as of the record date will be entitled to the dividend and dividend equivalent\nrights, respectively, which will be paid out if and when the underlying shares are released. However, the 4 million unvested RSUs\nassumed in connection with the acquisition of Avast will not be entitled to DERs. See Note 14 for further information about these\nequity awards. Any future dividends and DERs will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.\nStock repurchase program\nIn May 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program through which we may repurchase shares of\nour common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $3 billion with no fixed expiration. Under our stock repurchase program, we\nmay purchase shares of our outstanding common stock on the open market and through accelerated stock repurchase\ntransactions. As of September 27, 2024, we had $2,728 million remaining under the authorization to be completed in future\nperiods.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes activity related to our stock repurchase program during six months ended September 27,\n2024 and September 29, 2023:\nSix Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29,\n(In millions, except per share amounts) 2024 2023\nNumber of shares repurchased 11 3\nAverage price per share $ 24.65 $ 16.71\nAggregate purchase price $ 272 $ 41\nWe did not have any stock repurchases during the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023.\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, consisted of foreign currency translation adjustments and\nunrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments:\nForeign Unrealized Gain\nCurrency (Loss) On\nTranslation Derivative\n(In millions) Adjustments Instruments Total\nBalance as of March 29, 2024 $ (5) $ 16 $ 11\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes 22 (19) 3\nBalance as of September 27, 2024 $ 17 $ (3) $ 14\nNote 14. Stock-Based Compensation\nAvast equity awards\nIn connection with our acquisition of Avast, we assumed the outstanding equity awards under two of Avast’s equity incentive\nplans (the Avast Holding B.V. 2014 Share Option Plan and the Rules of the Avast plc Long Term Incentive Plan (collectively, the\nAvast Plans)), which consisted of 4 million unvested RSUs. The assumed RSUs generally retain the terms and conditions under\nwhich they were originally granted. We intend to grant all additional shares that remain available for issuance under the Avast\nPlans. Upon vesting, these assumed RSUs and any additional shares granted will settle into shares of our common stock.\nThe following table sets forth the stock-based compensation expense recognized for our equity incentive plans:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n(In millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of revenues $ 1 $ 1 $ 2 $ 2\nSales and marketing 9 10 18 19\nResearch and development 9 10 18 21\nGeneral and administrative 14 13 26 29\nRestructuring and other costs — 1 — 1\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 33 $ 35 $ 64 $ 72\nIncome tax benefit for stock-based compensation\n$ (4) $ (4) $ (8) $ (9)\nexpense\nAs of September 27, 2024, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to our unvested stock-based\nawards was $238 million, which will be recognized over an estimated weighted-average amortization period of 2.0 years.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes additional information related to our stock-based awards:\nSix Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29,\n(In millions, except per grant data) 2024 2023\nRestricted stock units (RSUs):\nWeighted-average fair value per award granted $ 23.56 $ 17.33\nAwards granted 5 5\nTotal fair value of awards released $ 73 $ 55\nOutstanding and unvested 9 10\nPerformance-based restricted stock units (PRUs):\nWeighted-average fair value per award granted $ 32.44 $ 22.79\nAwards granted 1 2\nTotal fair value of awards released $ 24 $ 19\nOutstanding and unvested at target payout 5 5\nDividend equivalent rights (DERs)\nOur RSUs and PRUs, except for the 4 million assumed RSUs under the Avast Plans, contain DERs that entitle the recipient\nof an award to receive cash dividend payments when the associated award is released. The amount of DERs equals to the\ncumulated dividends on the issued number of common stock that would have been payable since the date the associated award\nwas granted. As of September 27, 2024 and March 29, 2024, current dividends payable related to DER was $4 million recorded\nas part of Other current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, and long-term dividends payable related to\nDER was $3 million and $4 million, respectively, recorded as part of Other long-term liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheets.\nNote 15. Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding\nduring the period. Diluted net income per share also includes the incremental effect of dilutive potentially issuable common\nshares outstanding. Dilutive potentially issuable common shares include the dilutive effect of employee equity awards.\nThe components of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are as follows:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n(In millions, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income (loss) $ 161 $ 147 $ 342 $ 334\nNet income (loss) per share - basic $ 0.26 $ 0.23 $ 0.55 $ 0.52\nNet income (loss) per share - diluted $ 0.26 $ 0.23 $ 0.55 $ 0.52\nWeighted-average shares outstanding - basic 616 640 618 640\nDilutive potentially issuable shares:\nEmployee equity awards 6 4 6 4\nWeighted-average shares outstanding - diluted 622 644 624 644\nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from diluted net income\nper share calculation:\nEmployee equity awards — 3 — 3\nNote 16.

Legacy includes revenues from products or\nsolutions from markets that we have exited and in which we no longer operate, have been discontinued or identified to be\ndiscontinued, or remain in maintenance mode as a result of integration and product portfolio decisions.\nGeographic information\nNet revenues by geography are based on the billing addresses of our customers. The following table represents net revenues\nby geographic area for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n(In millions) 2024 2023 (1) 2024 2023 (1)\nAmericas $ 641 $ 618 $ 1,277 $ 1,232\nEMEA 233 227 466 453\nAPJ 100 100 196 203\nTotal net revenues (1) $ 974 $ 945 $ 1,939 $ 1,888\nNote: The Americas include U.S., Canada and Latin America; EMEA includes Europe, Middle East and Africa; APJ includes Asia Pacific and\nJapan.\n(1) From time to time, changes in allocation methodologies cause changes to the revenue by geographic area above. When changes occur, we\nrecast historical amounts to match the current methodology, such as for the three and six months ended September 29, 2023 where we\naligned allocation methodologies across similar product categories.\nRevenues from customers inside the U.S. were $584 million and $1,163 million during the three and six months ended\nSeptember 27, 2024, respectively, and $563 million and $1,121 million during the three and six months ended September 29,\n2023, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors,\nlessors, business partners, subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, product\nwarranties and losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us, including claims\nalleging that our software infringes on the intellectual property rights of a third party. In addition, our bylaws contain\nindemnification obligations to our directors, officers, employees, and agents, and we have entered into indemnification\nagreements with our directors and certain of our officers to give such directors and officers additional contractual assurances\nregarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in our bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections. We maintain\ndirector and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our directors and\nofficers. It is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the\nlimited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.\nSuch indemnification agreements might not be subject to maximum loss clauses. We monitor the conditions that are subject to\nindemnification to identify if a loss has occurred. Historically, we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under\nthese agreements, and we have not accrued any material liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nLitigation contingencies\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, regulatory proceedings, claims,\nmediations, arbitrations and litigation, arising out of the ordinary court of business. We evaluate contingent liabilities including\nthreatened or pending litigation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on contingencies. We assess the likelihood of any\nadverse judgements or outcomes from potential claims or proceedings for accrual or disclosure in our Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. A determination of the amount of an accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after the\nanalysis of each separate matter. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimates on the information\navailable at the time of our assessment. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to\nour pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates and disclosures. We classify our accruals for litigation\ncontingencies in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as part of Other current liabilities or Other long-term liabilities\nbased on when we expect to pay the claim, if at all. If the period of expected payment is within one year, we classify the amount\nas short-term; otherwise, it is classified as long-term. The exact timing of payment is subject to uncertainty and could change\nsignificantly from our estimated payment period.\nTrustees of the University of Columbia in the City of New York v. NortonLifeLock\nAs previously disclosed, on May 2, 2022, a jury returned its verdict in a patent infringement case filed in 2013 by the Trustees\nof Columbia University in the City of New York (Columbia) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Columbia\noriginally brought suit alleging infringement of six patents owned by the university. We won a favorable claim construction order\non all six patents, and the claim construction was upheld by the Federal Circuit in 2016 on all but U.S. Patent Nos. 8,601,322 and\n8,074,115. We also sought inter partes review by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the claims of the ‘322 and ‘115 Patents\nand all but two claims of the ‘322 Patent and three claims of the ‘115 Patent were invalidated. The remaining claims of the ‘322\nand ‘115 Patents were the only claims that remained in suit at trial.\nThe jury found that our Norton Security products and Symantec Endpoint Protection products (the latter of which were sold by\nus to Broadcom as part of an Asset Purchase Agreement dated November 4, 2019) willfully infringe the ‘322 and ‘115 Patents\nthrough the use of SONAR/BASH behavioral protection technology. The jury awarded damages in the amount of $185 million.\nColumbia did not seek injunctive relief against us. We believe that we have ceased the use of the technology found by the jury to\ninfringe. The jury also found that we did not fraudulently conceal its prosecution of U.S. Patent No. 8,549,643 but did find that two\nColumbia professors were coinventors of this patent. No damages were awarded related to this patent.\nOn September 30, 2023, the court entered its judgment, which awarded Columbia (i) enhanced damages of 2.6 times the jury\naward; (ii) prejudgment interest, post-judgment interest, and supplemental damages to be calculated in accordance with the\nparties’ previous agreement; and (iii) attorneys’ fees subject to the parties meeting and conferring as to amount. We have\ncomplied with the court’s order and submitted a stipulation regarding the final calculations of all outstanding interest, royalties\nand attorneys’ fees. We have posted the required surety bond and have appealed the judgement to the Federal Circuit Court of\nAppeals, which remains pending.\nAt this time, our current estimate of probable losses from this matter is approximately $591 million, which we have accrued\nand recorded as part of Other long-term liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. There is a reasonable\n22\nTable of Contents\npossibility that a loss may be incurred in excess of our accrual for this matter; however, such incremental loss cannot be\nreasonably estimated.\nSecurities Class Action and Derivative Litigation\nSecurities class action lawsuits, which have since been consolidated, were filed in May 2018 against us and certain of our\nformer officers, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The lead plaintiff’s consolidated amended\ncomplaint alleged that, during a purported class period of May 11, 2017 to August 2, 2018, defendants made false and\nmisleading statements in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a), and that certain individuals violated Section 20A, of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).\nOn May 24, 2021, the parties reached a proposed settlement and release of all claims in the class action, for $70 million, and\non June 8, 2021, the parties executed a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement, exclusive of any claims that may be brought by\nshareholders who opted out of the class action. Of the $70 million, $67 million was covered under the applicable insurance policy\nwith the remainder paid by us into escrow in September 2021. The Court approved the settlement on February 12, 2022,\nreleasing the settlement payment from escrow.\nOn November 22, 2021, investment funds managed by Orbis Investment Management Ltd. which previously opted out of the\nsecurities class action, filed suit under the Exchange Act, the Arizona Securities Act, the Arizona Consumer Fraud Act and certain\ncommon law causes of action to recover alleged damages for losses incurred by the funds for their purchases or acquisitions of\nour common stock during the class period. On February 7, 2023, our Motion to Dismiss was granted in part and denied in part.\nThe parties have now settled the matter and the action was dismissed with prejudice on April 26, 2023. The impact of settlement\nwas not material.\nPurported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our former officers and current and former\ndirectors in the Delaware Court of Chancery (In re Symantec Corp. S’holder. Deriv. Litig.), Northern District of California (Lee v.\nClark et al.,), and the District of Delaware (Milliken vs. Clark et al.). These assert generally the same facts and circumstances as\nalleged in the securities class action and allege claims for breach of fiduciary duty and related claims. On January 4, 2023, after\nreaching an agreement on the terms of the proposed settlement, which provides for, among other things, a payment of\n$12 million to the Company by the insurers of the Company’s directors and officers, the parties to the Chancery action filed a\nStipulation and Agreement of Settlement, Compromise and Release in that Court, which was approved by the Court on May 4,\n2023, over the objection of the Lee and Milliken plaintiffs, and releases all claims in the Chancery, Lee, and Milliken actions, as\nwell as any other claims based on the same operative facts. The parties in the Milliken action stipulated to a dismissal with\nprejudice, which was entered by that Court on May 12, 2023. The parties in the Lee action stipulated to a dismissal with\nprejudice, which was entered by that Court on June 12, 2023. All three shareholder derivative lawsuits are now resolved.\nA fourth lawsuit filed in the Delaware Superior Court, Kukard v. Symantec, brought claims derivatively on behalf of our 2008\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan. The parties have reached a settlement in principle, subject to Court approval. The impact of\nsettlement was not material.\nGSA\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we were advised by the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Department of Justice’s\n(DOJ) Civil Division and the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia that the government is\ninvestigating our compliance with certain provisions of our U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Multiple Award Schedule\nContract No. GS-35F-0240T effective January 24, 2007, including provisions relating to pricing, country of origin, accessibility,\nand the disclosure of commercial sales practices.\nAs reported on the GSA’s publicly available database, our total sales under the GSA Schedule contract were approximately\n$222 million from the period beginning January 2007 and ending September 2012. We fully cooperated with the government\nthroughout its investigation, and in January 2014, representatives of the government indicated that their initial analysis of our\nactual damages exposure from direct government sales under the GSA Schedule contract was approximately $145 million; since\nthe initial meeting, the government’s analysis of our potential damages exposure relating to direct sales increased. The\ngovernment also indicated they would pursue claims for certain sales to California, Florida, and New York as well as sales to the\nfederal government through reseller GSA Schedule contracts, which could significantly increase our potential damages\nexposure.\nIn 2012, a sealed civil lawsuit was filed against us related to compliance with the GSA Schedule contract and contracts with\nCalifornia, Florida, and New York. On July 18, 2014, the Court-imposed seal expired, and the government intervened in the\nlawsuit. On September 16, 2014, the states of California and Florida intervened in the lawsuit, and the state of New York notified\nthe Court that it would not intervene. On October 3, 2014, the DOJ filed an amended complaint, which did not state a specific\ndamages amount. On October 17, 2014, California and Florida combined their claims with those of the DOJ and the relator on\nbehalf of New York in an Omnibus Complaint, and a First Amended Omnibus Complaint was filed on October 8, 2015; the state\nclaims also do not state specific damages amounts.\nOn March 23, 2021, plaintiffs withdrew their demand for a jury trial and we consented to proceed with a bench trial, which\nconcluded on March 24, 2022. We settled with the State of Florida before trial and the State of New York during trial, both for\nimmaterial amounts which have been paid. On January 19, 2023, the Court issued its Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law\nin which it found in favor of the United States in part and awarded damages and penalties in the amount of $1.3 million. The\nCourt also found in favor of the State of California in part and awarded penalties in the amount of $0.4 million. The resulting\nJudgment was filed by the Court on January 20, 2023. On February 16, 2023, plaintiffs filed Motions to Amend Judgment to\n23\nTable of Contents\nrevive the damages claimed at trial. On January 16, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part the United States’ Motion\nto Amend and awarded $53 million in damages and penalties. The State of California’s Motion to Amend was denied.\nThe January 2023 judgment amount has been paid, and at this time, our current estimate of the low end of the range of\nprobable estimated losses from this matter is $53 million, which we have accrued and recorded as part of Other current liabilities\nin the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. On February 13, 2024, we filed a motion to amend and correct the judgement in\nthat the revised damages in the January 2024 decision include damages for products not included on the GSA schedule at issue\nin the case. The Court denied that motion on August 30, 2024, and subsequently issued its Judgment on September 30, 2024.\nThe parties’ deadline to file a Notice of Appeal was October 29, 2024. Neither party filed a Notice of Appeal and we expect to\npay the judgment, including post-judgment interest, in November 2024. In addition, we are currently negotiating the amount of\nattorneys’ fees owed to the Relator. If a negotiated resolution as to fees is not reached, Relator’s deadline to bring a motion for\nfees is December 2, 2024.\nJumpshot Matters\nAt the end of 2019, Avast came under media scrutiny for provision of Avast customer data to its data analytics subsidiary\nJumpshot Inc. Jumpshot was a subsidiary of Avast with its own management team and technical experts. Avast announced the\ndecision to terminate its provision of data to, and wind down, Jumpshot on January 30, 2020. As Avast has previously disclosed,\nit has been in communication with certain regulators and authorities prior to completion of the acquisition of Avast, and we will\ncontinue cooperating fully in respect of all regulatory enquiries.\nOn December 23, 2019, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) to\nAvast seeking documents and information related to its privacy practices, including Jumpshot's past use of consumer information\nthat was provided to it by Avast. Avast responded cooperatively to the CID and related follow-up requests from the FTC. On\nOctober 29, 2021, staff at the FTC sent Avast a draft complaint and proposed settlement order. We engaged in ongoing\nnegotiations with the FTC staff and have reached a negotiated agreement on the terms of a Consent Decree resolving this\ninvestigation, the terms of which are now final. This includes a provision for a non-material amount of monetary relief, which has\nbeen paid.\nOn February 27, 2020, the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection (the Czech DPA) initiated offense proceedings\nconcerning Avast`s practices with respect to Jumpshot, the Czech DPA issued a decision in March 2022 finding that Avast had\nviolated the GDPR and issued a fine of CZK 351 million, which is approximately $15 million. Avast appealed the decision, which\nwas affirmed by the Czech DPA on April 10, 2024. Avast has now paid the fine levied by the DPA. On June 15, 2024, Avast\nbrought a judicial action in the administrative law court challenging the decision of the Czech DPA. That matter is still pending.\nOn March 27, 2024, Stichting CUIC – Privacy Foundation for Collective Redress, a Dutch foundation (the Foundation), filed\nits writ of summons to initiate a collective action. The Foundation has asserted it represents the interests of Avast customers in\nthe Netherlands whose data was provided to Jumpshot and that by doing so Avast violated the requirements of the GDPR and\nother provisions in Dutch and European Union privacy and consumer law entitling those customers to damages and other\ncompensation, all of which we dispute. No specific amount of damages has been alleged to date. At this stage, we are unable to\nassess whether any material loss or adverse effect is reasonably possible or estimate the range of any potential loss.\nOn April 18, 2024, we received a letter before action from counsel in the United Kingdom asserting it may bring a\nrepresentative action on behalf of a class of Avast users in the United Kingdom and Wales for breach of contract and misuse of\nprivate information and seeking unspecified damages and a permanent injunction. No lawsuit has been commenced. At this\nstage, we are unable to assess whether any material loss or adverse effect is reasonably possible or estimate the range of any\npotential loss.\nOn December 12, 2022, a putative class action, Lau v. Gen Digital Inc. and Jumpshot Inc., was filed in the Northern District of\nCalifornia alleging violations of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, California Invasion of Privacy Act, statutory larceny,\nunfair competition and various common law claims related to the provision of customer data to Jumpshot. Such claims, to the\nextent related to Jumpshot, have now been dismissed from the case as has Jumpshot Inc. as a defendant. At this stage, we are\nunable to assess whether any material loss or adverse effect is reasonably possible as a result of this action or estimate the\nrange of any potential loss. We dispute these claims and intend to defend them vigorously.\nThe outcome of the regulatory proceedings, government enforcement actions and litigation is difficult to predict, and the cost\nto defend, settle or otherwise resolve these matters may be significant. Plaintiffs or regulatory agencies or authorities in these\nmatters may seek recovery of large or indeterminate amounts or seek to impose sanctions, including significant monetary\npenalties, as well as equitable relief. The monetary and other impact of these litigations, proceedings or actions may remain\nunknown for substantial periods of time. Further, an unfavorable resolution of litigations, proceedings or actions could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows. The amount of time that\nwill be required to resolve these matters is unpredictable, and these matters may divert management’s attention from the day-to-\nday operations of our business. Any future investigations or additional lawsuits may also adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOther\nWe are involved in a number of other judicial and administrative proceedings that are incidental to our business. Although\nadverse decisions (or settlements) may occur in one or more of the cases, it is not possible to estimate the possible loss or\nlosses from each of these cases. The final resolution of these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n24\nTable of Contents\nDuring the three and six months ended September 27, 2024, we incurred $25 million and $40 million, respectively, related to\nthe estimated accrual and final resolutions of our litigation contingencies in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of\nOperations. During the three and six months ended September 29, 2023, we incurred $347 million and $352 million, respectively,\nrelated to the estimated accrual and final resolutions of our litigation contingencies in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of\nOperations.\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results\nThe discussion below contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to safe harbors under the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended (the Securities Act) and the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Forward-looking\nstatements include statements that represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including, without limitation,\nreferences to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, as well as statements including words such as “expects,” “plans,”\n“anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “goal,” “intent,” “momentum,” “projects,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “strategy,” “future,”\n“opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” and similar expressions. In addition, projections of our future\nfinancial performance; anticipated growth and trends in our businesses and in our industries; the consummation of or anticipated\nimpacts of acquisitions (including our ability to achieve synergies from acquisitions, including Avast), divestitures, restructurings,\nstock repurchases, financings, debt repayments and investment activities; the outcome or impact of pending litigation, claims or\ndisputes; our intent to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future; plans for and anticipated benefits of our products and solutions;\nanticipated tax rates, benefits and expenses; the impact of inflation, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in\ninterest rates, ongoing and new geopolitical conflicts, and other global macroeconomic factors on our operations and financial\nperformance; and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. These statements\nare only predictions, based on our current expectations about future events and may not prove to be accurate. We do not\nundertake any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events occurring or circumstances arising after\nthe date of this report. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and our actual results, performance, or\nachievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements on the basis of several\nfactors, including economic recessions, inflationary pressures and those other factors that we discuss in Part II Item 1A. Risk\nFactors, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended March 29, 2024. We encourage you to read those sections carefully. There may also be other factors that have not been\nanticipated or that are not described in our periodic filings with the SEC, generally because we did not believe them to be\nsignificant at the time, which could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections and expectations. All forward-\nlooking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.\nOVERVIEW\nGen is a global company powering Digital Freedom with a family of trusted consumer brands including Norton, Avast,\nLifeLock, Avira, AVG, ReputationDefender and CCleaner.

The three and six months ended September 27,\n2024 and September 29, 2023 each consisted of 13 and 26 weeks, respectively. Our 2025 fiscal year consists of 52 weeks and\nends on March 28, 2025.\nKey financial metrics\nThe following tables provide our key financial metrics for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n(In millions, except for per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet revenues $ 974 $ 945 $ 1,939 $ 1,888\nOperating income (loss) $ 402 $ 22 $ 819 $ 381\nNet income (loss) $ 161 $ 147 $ 342 $ 334\nNet income (loss) per share - diluted $ 0.26 $ 0.23 $ 0.55 $ 0.52\nAs Of\nSeptember 27,\n(In millions) 2024 March 29, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents $ 737 $ 846\nContract liabilities $ 1,827 $ 1,884\n25\nTable of Contents\nBelow are our financial highlights for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to the corresponding period in the prior\nyear:\n• Net revenues increased $29 million, primarily due to higher sales in both our consumer security and identity and\ninformation protection products.\n• Operating income increased $380 million, primarily due to increased net revenues, decrease in legal costs related to\nongoing litigation, lower amortization of intangible assets, and restructuring costs related to our acquisition of Avast.\n• Net income increased $14 million and net income per share increased $0.03, primarily due to increased operating\nincome discussed above and decreased interest expense associated with our Term B facility. This is offset by the\nabsence of an income tax benefit in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\nBelow are our financial highlights for the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared to the corresponding period in the prior\nyear:\n• Net revenues increased $51 million, primarily due to higher sales in both our consumer security and identity and\ninformation protection products.\n• Operating income increased $438 million, primarily due to increased net revenues, decrease in legal costs related to\nongoing litigation, lower amortization of intangible assets, and restructuring costs related to our acquisition of Avast.\n• Net income increased $8 million and net income per share increased $0.03, primarily due to increased operating\nincome discussed above and decreased interest expense associated with our Term B facility. This is offset by the\nabsence of an income tax benefit in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\n• Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $109 million compared to March 29, 2024, primarily due to repurchases of our\ncommon stock, cash interest paid, dividends paid to shareholders, voluntary prepayments of our Term B facility, and\nmandatory principal amortization payments of our Term A and B facility. This is partially offset by cash generated from\noperating activities during the first six months of fiscal 2025.\n• Contract liabilities decreased $57 million compared to March 29, 2024, primarily due to billing seasonality and\nfluctuations in foreign currency rates.\nGLOBAL MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to inflation, changes in foreign currency exchange rates\nrelative to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency, changes in interest rates, as well as recession risks, any of which may persist for\nan extended period. Additionally, our international results are impacted by the economic conditions in the foreign markets in\nwhich we operate and by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, although volatility did not have a significant impact on\nour reported results for the second quarter of our fiscal year 2025. We conduct business in numerous currencies throughout our\nworldwide operations, and our entities hold monetary assets or liabilities, earn revenues, or incur costs in currencies other than\nthe entity’s functional currency. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange gains or losses, which impact our operating\nresults. As part of our foreign currency risk mitigation strategy, we have entered into monthly foreign exchange forward contracts\nto hedge certain foreign currency balance sheet exposure.\nIn addition, in early 2022, worldwide inflation began to increase. In response to the heightened levels of inflation, central\nbanks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, raised interest rates significantly in 2022, resulting in\nan increase in our cost of debt. Although inflation rates slowed in 2023, global inflation currently remains high and has impacted\nour results due to higher costs. Volatile market conditions related to geopolitical conflicts and other macroeconomic events have,\nat times, affected our results of operations and cash flows in non-material ways; however, geopolitical conflicts and other\nmacroeconomic events may in the future materially impact our results of operations and cash flows. Due to our subscription-\nbased business model, the effect of recent macroeconomic events may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until\nfuture periods, if at all.\nInflation, interest rates and foreign exchange rates remained volatile in 2023 and fluctuations in these indicators continue to\nremain uncertain and could result in further adverse impacts to our reported results. For a further discussion of the potential\nimpacts of the global macroeconomic conditions on our business, please see Part I, Item III and “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A\nbelow.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the U.S. requires us to make estimates, including judgments and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We\nhave based our estimates, judgements and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors we believe to be\nreasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates, judgements and assumptions on a regular basis and make\nchanges accordingly. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable;\nhowever, actual results may differ from these estimates. Making estimates, judgments and assumptions about future events is\ninherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these\nestimates, judgements or assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of\noperations, financial position and cash flows.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOur critical accounting policies and estimates were disclosed in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024.\nThere have been no material changes in the matters for which we make critical accounting estimates in the preparation of our\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements during the three and six months ended September 27, 2024.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations data as a percentage of net revenues for\nthe periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet revenues 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 %\nCost of revenues 20 19 20 19\nGross profit 80 81 80 81\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 19 20 19 19\nResearch and development 9 9 8 9\nGeneral and administrative 7 42 6 24\nAmortization of intangible assets 5 6 4 6\nRestructuring and other costs — 2 — 2\nTotal operating expenses 39 79 38 61\nOperating income (loss) 41 2 42 20\nInterest expense (15) (18) (16) (18)\nOther income (expense), net 1 1 1 1\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 26 (15) 28 3\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 10 (31) 10 (15)\nNet income (loss) 17 % 16 % 18 % 18 %\nNote: Percentages may not add due to rounding.\nNet revenues\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nSeptember September September September\n(In millions, except for percentages) 27, 2024 29, 2023 Change in % 27, 2024 29, 2023 Change in %\nNet revenues $ 974 $ 945 3 % $ 1,939 $ 1,888 3 %\nThree Months Ended September 27, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 29, 2023\nNet revenues increased $29 million, due to a $19 million increase in sales of our identity and information protection products\nand a $14 million increase in sales of our consumer security products. This was partially offset by a $4 million decrease in our\nlegacy product offerings. This is inclusive of $1 million of foreign exchange headwinds, in our consumer security solutions.\nSix Months Ended September 27, 2024 Compared with Six Months Ended September 29, 2023\nNet revenues increased $51 million, due to a $34 million increase in sales of our identity and information protection products\nand a $24 million increase in sales of our consumer security products. This was partially offset by a $7 million decrease in our\nlegacy product offerings. This is inclusive of $8 million of foreign exchange headwinds, in our consumer security solutions.\nPerformance Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance.\nWe believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of\n27\nTable of Contents\nour business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Our metrics may be calculated in a manner\ndifferent than similar metrics used by other companies.\nThe following table summarizes supplemental key performance metrics:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29,\n(In millions, except for per user amounts) 2024 2023\nDirect customer revenues $ 860 $ 834\nPartner revenues $ 102 95\nTotal cyber safety revenues $ 962 $ 929\nLegacy revenues (1) $ 12 $ 16\nDirect customer count (at quarter end) 39.7 38.5\nDirect average revenue per user (ARPU) $ 7.26 $ 7.25\nRetention rate 78 % 77 %\n(1) Legacy revenues includes revenues from products or solutions from markets that we have exited and in which we no longer operate, have\nbeen discontinued or identified to be discontinued, or remain in maintenance mode as a result of integration and product portfolio decisions.\nWe define direct customer count as active paid users of our products and solutions who have a direct billing and/or\nregistration relationship with us at the end of the reported period. We exclude users on free trials from our direct customer count.\nUsers who have indirectly purchased and/or registered for our products or solutions through partners are excluded unless such\nusers convert or renew their subscription directly with us or sign up for a paid membership through our web stores or third-party\napp stores. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require judgment and are subject to change due to improvements\nor revisions to our methodology. From time to time, we review our metrics and may discover inaccuracies or make adjustments\nto improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics\nmay be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We\ngenerally do not intend to update previously disclosed metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are deemed not\nmaterial.\nARPU is calculated as estimated direct customer revenues for the period divided by the average direct customer count for the\nsame period, expressed as a monthly figure. Non-GAAP estimated direct customer revenues and ARPU have limitations as\nanalytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for U.S. GAAP estimated direct customer revenues or\nother U.S. GAAP measures. We monitor ARPU because it helps us understand the rate at which we are monetizing our\nconsumer customer base.\nRetention rate is defined as the percentage of direct customers as of the end of the period from one year ago who are still\nactive as of the most recently completed fiscal period. We monitor the retention rate to evaluate the effectiveness of our\nstrategies to improve renewals of subscriptions.\nNet revenues by geographical region\nThree Months Ended (1) Six Months Ended (1)\nSeptember 27, September 29, September 27, September 29,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAmericas 66 % 65 % 66 % 65 %\nEMEA 24 % 24 % 24 % 24 %\nAPJ 10 % 11 % 10 % 11 %\n(1) From time to time, changes in allocation methodologies cause changes to the revenue by geographic area above. When changes occur, we\nrecast historical amounts to match the current methodology, such as for the three and six months ended September 29, 2023 where we\naligned allocation methodologies across similar product categories.\nThe Americas include the U.S., Canada and Latin America; EMEA includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa; APJ includes\nAsia Pacific and Japan.\nPercentage of revenue by geographic region in the three and six months ended September 27, 2024 remains primarily in the\nAmericas.\nCost of revenues\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nSeptember September September September\n(In millions, except for percentages) 27, 2024 29, 2023 Change in % 27, 2024 29, 2023 Change in %\nCost of revenues $ 194 $ 180 8 % $ 384 $ 359 7 %\nThree Months Ended September 27, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 29, 2023\nCost of revenues increased $14 million, primarily due to a $13 million increase in revenue share costs.\n28\nTable of Contents\nSix Months Ended September 27, 2024 Compared with Six Months Ended September 29, 2023\nCost of revenues increased $25 million, primarily due to a $22 million increase in revenue share costs.\nOperating expenses\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nSeptember September September September\n(In millions, except for percentages) 27, 2024 29, 2023 Change in % 27, 2024 29, 2023 Change in %\nSales and marketing $ 184 $ 187 (2) % $ 367 $ 368 — %\nResearch and development 83 85 (2) % 164 175 (6) %\nGeneral and administrative 64 393 (84) % 116 449 (74) %\nAmortization of intangible assets 44 61 (28) % 87 122 (29) %\nRestructuring and other costs 3 17 (82) % 2 34 (94) %\nTotal operating expenses $ 378 $ 743 (49) % $ 736 $ 1,148 (36) %\nThree Months Ended September 27, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 29, 2023\nSales and marketing and research and development remained relatively flat.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $329 million, primarily due to the absence of $335 million in legal costs\nrelated to our litigation with the Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York (Columbia) in the second quarter of fiscal\n2024.\nAmortization of intangible assets decreased $17 million, primarily due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized during\nfiscal 2024.\nRestructuring and other costs decreased $14 million, due to a $13 million decrease in severance, termination benefits,\ncontract cancellation costs and other exit and disposal costs in connection with the September 2022 Plan and a $1 million\ndecrease in stock-based compensation expense.

On December 12, 2022, the European Union reached an agreement to implement the Pillar\nTwo directive of the OECD’s reform of international taxation at the European Union level. The agreement affirms that all Member\nStates must transpose the Pillar Two directive by December 31, 2023. The rules will therefore first be applicable for fiscal years\nstarting on or after December 31, 2023. Ireland, Czech Republic, and certain jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted\nlegislation to implement Pillar Two and other countries are actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of\nthe OECD’s proposals. The enactment of Pillar Two legislation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our effective\ntax rate and Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the near term. We will continue to monitor and reflect the impact\nof such legislative changes in future Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as appropriate.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND CASH REQUIREMENTS\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically relied on cash generated from operations, borrowings under credit facilities, issuances of debt and\nproceeds from divestitures for our liquidity needs.\nOur capital allocation strategy is to balance driving stockholder returns, managing financial risk and preserving our flexibility\nto pursue strategic options, including acquisitions and mergers. Historically, this has included a quarterly cash dividend, the\nrepayment of debt and the repurchase of shares of our common stock.\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with\ncash generated from operations, amounts available under our Revolving Facility and our future refinancing plans related to our\nupcoming maturities, will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs, support on-going business activities and finance the\nexpected synergy costs related to the acquisition of Avast through at least the next 12 months and to meet our known long-term\ncontractual obligations. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will\nresult in or that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our\ncapital needs during or beyond the next 12 months. However, our future liquidity and capital requirements may vary materially\nfrom those as of September 27, 2024, depending on several factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions; political\nclimate; the expansion of sales and marketing activities; the costs to acquire or invest in businesses; and the risks and\nuncertainties discussed in “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A below.\nCash flows\nThe following summarizes our cash flow activities:\nSix Months Ended\nSeptember 27, September 29,\n(In millions) 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 422 $ 351\nInvesting activities $ (10) $ 3\nFinancing activities $ (538) $ (485)\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-\nQ for our supplemental cash flow information.\nCash from operating activities\nOur cash flows provided by operating activities increased $71 million, primarily due to higher profit before taxes adjusted by\nnon-cash items, increased cash collection from our cyber safety billings and an increase in accounts payable as a result of the\ntiming of payments. This is partially offset by increased cash taxes paid compared to during the first six months of fiscal 2024.\n30\nTable of Contents\nCash from investing activities\nOur cash flows provided by and used in investing activities remained relatively flat.\nCash from financing activities\nOur cash flows used in financing activities increased $53 million, primarily due to a $231 million increase in repurchases of\ncommon stock under our repurchase program. This was partially offset by a $120 million decrease in voluntary prepayments of\nour Term B Facility and a $58 million decrease in mandatory principal prepayments of our Term A and B Facilities as compared\nto during the first six months of fiscal 2024.\nCash and cash equivalents\nAs of September 27, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $737 million, of which $400 million was held by our foreign\nsubsidiaries. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed with the objective to preserve principal,\nmaintain liquidity and generate investment returns. The participation exemption system under current U.S. federal tax regulations\ngenerally allows us to make distributions of non-U.S. earnings to the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal tax, however,\nthese distributions may be subject to applicable state or foreign taxes.\nDebt\nWe have an undrawn revolving credit facility of $1,490 million, net of our letters of credit, which expires in September 2027.\nStock repurchases\nDuring the six months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, we executed repurchases of 11 million and 3\nmillion of our common stock under our existing stock repurchase program for an aggregate amount of $272 million and $41\nmillion, respectively.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOur principal cash requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support on-going business activities,\nincluding payment of taxes and cash dividends, payment of contractual obligations, funding capital expenditures, servicing\nexisting debt, repurchasing shares of our common stock and investing in business acquisitions and mergers.\nDebt instruments\nAs of September 27, 2024, our total outstanding principal amount of indebtedness is summarized as follows. See Note 9 of\nthe Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further\ninformation on our debt.\nSeptember 27,\n(In millions) 2024\nTerm Loans $ 6,022\nSenior Notes 2,600\nMortgage Loans 6\nTotal debt $ 8,628\nThe Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants,\nincluding compliance with specified financial ratios. As of September 27, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor further information regarding financial ratios and debt covenant compliance.\nDividends\nOn October 30, 2024, we announced a cash dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock to be paid in December 2024.\nAny future dividends and dividend equivalents will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors.\nStock repurchase program\nUnder our stock repurchase program, we may purchase shares of our outstanding common stock on the open market\n(including through trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act) and through accelerated stock\nrepurchase transactions. In May 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program through which we\nmay repurchase shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $3 billion with no fixed expiration. This new stock\nrepurchase program will supersede any amounts under the prior stock repurchase programs. As of September 27, 2024, the\nremaining balance of our stock repurchase authorization was $2,728 million and does not have an expiration date. The timing\nand actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market\nconditions and other investment opportunities.\n31\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring\nIn connection with the acquisition of Avast, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the September 2022 Plan) to\nrealize cost savings and operational synergies, which became effective upon the close of the acquisition on September 12, 2022.\nWe have incurred and expect to incur cash expenditures for severance and termination benefits, contract terminations, facilities\nclosures, and the sale of underutilized facilities as well as stock-based compensation charges for accelerated equity awards for\ncertain terminated employees. We expect that we will incur total costs up to $150 million following the completion of the\nacquisition. These actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2025. During the six months ended September 27,\n2024, we made $15 million in cash payments related to the September 2022 Plan. As of September 27, 2024, we have incurred\ncosts of $126 million related to the September 2022 Plan. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further cash flow information associated with our restructuring\nactivities.\nSignificant contractual obligations\nOur principal commitments consist of principal and interest payments related to our debt instruments, obligations under our\npurchase agreements, repatriation tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts and obligations under various non-\ncancellable leases. Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax\nbenefits and other long-term taxes as of September 27, 2024, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period\nof cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $1,395 million in long-term income taxes payable has been\nexcluded from our quarterly review of timing of contractual obligations.\nThere have been no material changes, outside the ordinary course of business, to the contractual obligations reported in our\nAnnual Report. For additional information about our debt obligations and certain other contingencies, see Note 9 and Note 17,\nrespectively, of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to various market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We may\nuse derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow that may result from\nadverse economic conditions and events or changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest rate risk\nAs of September 27, 2024, we had $2,600 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate Senior Notes outstanding, with a\ncarrying amount and a fair value of $2,650 million, based on Level 2 inputs. The fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest\nrates change. Since these notes bear interest at fixed rates, the financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates\nis limited to future refinancing of current debt obligations. If these notes were refinanced at higher interest rates prior to maturity,\nour total interest payments could increase by a material amount; however, this risk is mitigated by our strong cash position and\nexpected future cash generated from operations, which will be sufficient to satisfy this increase in obligation.\nAs of September 27, 2024, we also had $6,022 million outstanding debt with variable interest rates based on the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (SOFR). A hypothetical 100 basis point change in SOFR would have resulted in a $60 million increase\nin interest expense on an annualized basis.\nIn March 2023, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate risks associated with the variable interest rate of\nour Term A Facility. These pay-fixed, receive-floating rate interest rate swaps have the economic effect of hedging the variability\nof forecasted interest payments until their maturity on March 31, 2026. Pursuant to the agreements, we have effectively\nconverted $1 billion of our variable rate borrowings under Term A Facility to fixed rates, with $500 million at a fixed rate of 3.762%\nand $500 million at a fixed rate of 3.55%. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have\nresulted in a $14 million increase or $14 million decrease in the fair values of our floating to fixed rate interest swaps on\nSeptember 27, 2024.\nThe objective of our interest rate swaps, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges, is to manage the variability of future\ninterest expense.\nIn addition, we have a $1,490 million revolving credit facility, net of our letters of credit, that if drawn bears interest at a\nvariable rate based on SOFR and would be subject to the same risks associated with adverse changes in SOFR.\n32\nTable of Contents\nForeign currency exchange rate risk\nWe conduct business in numerous currencies through our worldwide operations, and our entities hold monetary assets or\nliabilities, earn revenues or incur costs in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency, primarily in Euro, Japanese Yen,\nBritish Pound, Australian Dollar, Czech Koruna and Canadian Dollar. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their\nuse of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services provided. Our cash flow, results of operations and\ncertain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from\nexpectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities.\nAs a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange gains or losses which impacts our operating results.\nGrowth in our international operations will incrementally increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as\nvolatile market conditions, including the weakening of foreign currencies relative to USD, which has and may in the future\nnegatively affect our revenue expressed in USD.\nWe manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations by executing monthly foreign exchange\nforward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. The gains and losses on these foreign exchange\ncontracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nWe do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency\nexposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of the changes in foreign exchange rates. As our international operations\ngrow, we will continue to reassess our approach to managing risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency.\nAdditional information related to our debt and derivative instruments is included in Note 9 and Note 10, respectively, of the\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe SEC defines the term “disclosure controls and procedures” to mean a company’s controls and other procedures that are\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. “Disclosure\ncontrols and procedures” include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the\nissuer’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to\nprovide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management. Our management\n(with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness\nof our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act).\nBased on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.\n(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that occurred during the second quarter\nof fiscal 2025, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n(c) Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nFurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must\nbe considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\n33\nTable of Contents\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nInformation with respect to this Item may be found under the heading “Litigation contingencies” in Note 17 of the Notes to the\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nA description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below and in “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Legal Proceedings, and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures\nAbout Market Risk.” The list is not exhaustive, and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in\nour common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND INDUSTRY\nIf we are unable to develop new and enhanced solutions, or if we are unable to continually improve the performance,\nfeatures, and reliability of our existing solutions, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur future success depends on our ability to effectively respond to evolving threats to consumers, as well as competitive\ntechnological developments and industry changes, by developing or introducing new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis.\nIn the past, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant research and development expenses as we focus on organic\ngrowth through internal innovation. We believe that we must continue to dedicate significant resources to our research and\ndevelopment efforts to deliver innovative market competitive products and avoid being reliant on third-party technology and\nproducts. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed,\nour operating results may be adversely affected. We must continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating\nmarket trends and competitive developments. Customers may require features and capabilities that our current solutions do not\nhave. Our failure to develop new solutions and improve our existing solutions to satisfy customer preferences and effectively\ncompete with other market offerings in a timely and cost-effective manner may harm our ability to retain our customers and\nattract new customers.\nThe development and introduction of new solutions involve significant commitments of time and resources and are subject to\nrisks and challenges including but not limited to:\n• Lengthy development cycles;\n• Evolving industry and regulatory standards and technological developments, including AI and machine learning, by our\ncompetitors and customers;\n• Rapidly changing customer preferences and accurately anticipating technological trends or needs;\n• Evolving platforms, operating systems, and hardware products, such as mobile devices;\n• Product and service interoperability challenges with customer’s technology and third-party vendors;\n• The integration of products and solutions from acquired companies;\n• Availability of engineering and technical talent;\n• Entering new or unproven market segments; and\n• Executing new product and service strategies.\nIn addition, third parties, including operating systems and internet browser companies, have in the past and may in the future\nlimit the interoperability of our solutions with their own products and services, in some cases to promote their own offerings or\nthose of our competitors. Any such actions by third parties could delay the development of our solutions or our solutions may be\nunable to operate effectively. This could also result in decreased demand for our solutions, decreased revenue, harm to our\nreputation, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges, or if our new or improved solutions are not technologically\ncompetitive or do not achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment, and if we are unable to compete effectively, we could\nexperience a loss in market share and a reduction in revenue.\nWe operate in intensely competitive and dynamic markets that experience frequent and rapid technological developments,\nchanges in industry and regulatory standards, evolving market trends, changes in customer requirements and preferences, and\nfrequent new product introductions and improvements. If we are unable to anticipate or react to these continually evolving\nconditions, we could experience a loss of market share and a reduction in our revenues, which could materially and adversely\naffect our business and financial results. To compete successfully, we must maintain an innovative research and development\neffort to develop new solutions and enhance our existing solutions, and effectively adapt to changes in the technology, privacy\nand data protection standards or trends.\nWe face competition from a broad range of companies, including software vendors focusing on cyber safety solutions such as\nBitdefender, Kaspersky, McAfee and Trend Micro, operating system providers such as Apple, Google and Microsoft, and\ncompanies such as Nord, Life360, LastPass and others that currently specialize in one or a few particular segments of the\nmarket and many of which are expanding their product portfolios into different segments. Many of these competitors offer\n34\nTable of Contents\nsolutions or are currently developing solutions that directly compete with some or all of our offerings. We also face growing\ncompetition from other technology companies, as well as from companies in the identity threat protection space such as credit\nbureaus. Further, many of our competitors are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection\nsoftware and other competing cyber safety products such as antivirus protection or VPN, often free of charge, that compete with\nour offerings. Our competitive position could be adversely affected by the functionality incorporated into these products rendering\nour existing solutions obsolete and therefore causing us to fail to meet customer expectations. In addition, the introduction of new\nproducts or services by competitors, and/or market acceptance of products or services based on emerging or alternative\ntechnologies, could make it easier for other products or services to compete with our solutions.\nWe have seen and anticipate additional competition as new participants enter the cyber safety market and as our current\ncompetitors seek to increase their market share and expand their existing offerings. Some of our competitors have greater\nfinancial, technical, marketing, or other resources than we do, including in new cyber safety and digital life segments.\nConsequently, those competitors may influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours through investing more in\ninternal innovation than we can and through their unique access to customer engagement points. Further consolidation among\nour competitors and within our industry or, in addition to other changes in the competitive environment, such as greater vertical\nintegration from key computing and operating system suppliers could result in larger competitors that compete more frequently\nwith us.\nIn addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to end-users of our solutions, we compete with them for the\nopportunity to have our solutions bundled with the offerings of our strategic partners, such as computer hardware OEMs, internet\nservice providers, operating systems and telecom service providers. Our competitors could gain market share from us if any of\nthese strategic partners replace our solutions with those of our competitors or with their own solutions. Similarly, they could gain\nmarket share from us if these partners promote our competitors’ solutions or their own solutions more frequently or more\nfavorably than our solutions. In addition, software vendors who have bundled our solutions with theirs may choose to bundle their\nsolutions with their own or other vendors’ solutions or may limit our access to standard interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop\nsolutions for their platform. Further product development by these vendors could cause our solutions to become redundant,\nwhich could significantly impact our sales and operating results.\nWe cannot be sure that we will accurately predict how the markets in which we compete or intend to compete will evolve.\nFailure on our part to anticipate changes in our markets and to develop solutions and enhancements that meet the demands of\nthose markets or to effectively compete against our competitors will significantly impair our business, financial condition, results\nof operations, and cash flows.\nIssues in the development and deployment of AI may result in reputational harm and legal liability and could\nadversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have incorporated, and are continuing to develop and deploy, AI into many of our products, solutions and services. AI\npresents challenges and risks that could affect our products, solutions and services, and therefore our business. For example, AI\nalgorithms may have flaws, and datasets used to train models may be insufficient or contain biased information. These potential\nissues could subject us to regulatory risk, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions\nsuch as the EU and regulations being considered in other jurisdictions, and brand or reputational harm.\nThe rapid evolution of AI, including potential government regulation of AI, requires us to invest significant resources to\ndevelop, test, and maintain AI in our products and services in a manner that meets evolving requirements and expectations. The\nrules and regulations adopted by policymakers over time may require us to make changes to our business practices. Developing,\ntesting, and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost profile of our offerings due to the nature of the computing costs\ninvolved in such systems.\nThe intellectual property ownership and license rights surrounding AI technologies, as well as data protection laws related to\nthe use and development of AI, are currently not fully addressed by courts or regulators. The use or adoption of AI technologies\nin our products may result in exposure to claims by third parties of copyright infringement or other intellectual property\nmisappropriation, which may require us to pay compensation or license fees to third parties. The evolving legal, regulatory, and\ncompliance framework for AI technologies may also impact our ability to protect our own data and intellectual property against\ninfringing use.\nOur acquisitions and divestitures create special risks and challenges that could adversely affect our financial\nresults.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may acquire or divest businesses or assets. For example, in 2019, we completed the\nsale of certain of our enterprise security assets to Broadcom Inc. (the Broadcom sale), in January 2021, we completed the\nacquisition of Avira, and in September 2022, we completed the acquisition of Avast. Our acquisition and divestiture activities have\nand may continue to involve a number of risks and challenges, including:\n• Complexity, time and costs associated with managing these transactions, including the integration of acquired and the\nwinding down of divested business operations, workforce, products, IT systems and technologies;\n• Challenges in retaining the customers of acquired businesses, providing the same level of service to existing customers\nwith reduced resources, or retaining the third-party relationships, including with suppliers, service providers, and vendors,\namong others;\n• Diversion of management time and attention;\n35\nTable of Contents\n• Loss or termination of employees, including costs and potential institutional knowledge loss associated with the\ntermination or replacement of those employees;\n• Assumption of liabilities of the acquired and divested business or assets, including pending or future litigation,\ninvestigations or claims related to the acquired business or assets;\n• Addition of acquisition-related debt;\n• Difficulty entering into or expanding in new markets or geographies;\n• Increased or unexpected costs and working capital requirements;\n• Dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders;\n• Ongoing contractual obligations and unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations;\n• Substantial accounting charges for acquisition-related costs, asset impairments, amortization of intangible assets and\nhigher levels of stock-based compensation expense; and\n• Difficulty in realizing potential benefits, including cost savings and operational efficiencies, synergies and growth prospects\nfrom integrating acquired businesses.\nMacroeconomic factors, such as high inflation, high interest rates, and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and capital\nmarkets could negatively influence our future acquisition opportunities. Moreover, to be successful, large complex acquisitions\ndepend on large-scale product, technology, and sales force integrations that are difficult to complete on a timely basis or at all\nand may be more susceptible to the special risks and challenges described above. Any of the foregoing, and other factors, could\nharm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability or other financial benefits from our acquired or divested businesses,\nproduct lines or assets or to realize other anticipated benefits of divestitures or acquisitions.\nOur revenue and operating results depend significantly on our ability to retain our existing customers and expand\nsales to them, convert existing non-paying customers to paying customers and add new customers.\nWe generally sell our solutions to our customers on a monthly or annual subscription basis. It is important to our business that\nwe retain existing customers and that our customers expand their use of our solutions over time. Customers may choose not to\nrenew their membership with us at any time. Renewing customers may require additional incentives to renew, may not renew for\nthe same contract period, or may change their subscriptions. We therefore may be unable to retain our existing customers on the\nsame or more profitable terms, if at all. In addition, we may not be able to accurately predict or anticipate future trends in\ncustomer retention or effectively respond to such trends.\nOur customer retention rates may decline or fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including the following:\n• Our customers’ levels of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solutions and the value they place on our solutions;\n• The quality, breadth, and prices of our solutions, including solutions offered in emerging markets;\n• Our general reputation and events impacting that reputation;\n• The services and related pricing offered by our competitors; including increasing the availability and efficacy of free\nsolutions;\n• Disruption by new services or changes in law or regulations that impact the need for or efficacy of our products and\nservices;\n• Changes in auto-renewal and other consumer protection regulations;\n• Our customers’ dissatisfaction with our efforts to market additional products and services;\n• Our customer service and responsiveness to the needs of our customers;\n• Changes in our target customers’ spending levels as a result of general economic conditions, inflationary pressures or\nother factors; and\n• The quality and efficacy of our third-party partners who assist us in renewing customers’ subscriptions.\nDeclining customer retention rates could cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected or decline, and our operating\nresults, gross margins and business will be harmed. In addition, our ability to generate revenue and maintain or improve our\nresults of operations partly depends on our ability to cross-sell our solutions to our existing customers and to convert existing\nnon-paying customers to paying customers and add new customers. We may not be successful in cross selling our solutions\nbecause our customers may find our additional solutions unnecessary or unattractive. Our failure to sell additional solutions to\nour existing customers, failure to convert existing non-paying customers to paying customers or add new customers could\nadversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nAn important part of our growth strategy involves continued investment in direct marketing efforts, indirect partner distribution\nchannels, freemium channels, our sales force, and infrastructure to add new customers. The number and rate at which new\ncustomers purchase our products and services depends on a number of factors, including those outside of our control, such as\ncustomers’ perceived need for our solutions, competition, general economic conditions, market transitions, product\nobsolescence, technological change, public awareness of security threats to IT systems, macroeconomic conditions, and other\nfactors. New customers, if any, may subscribe or renew their subscriptions at lower rates than we have experienced in the past,\nintroducing uncertainty about their economic attractiveness and potentially impacting our financial results.\n36\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, there are inherent challenges in measuring the usage of our products and solutions across our brands,\nplatforms, regions, and internal systems, and therefore, calculation methodologies for direct customer counts may differ, which\nmay impact our ability to measure the addition of new customers. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require\njudgment and are also susceptible to algorithms or other technical errors. We continually seek to improve our estimates of our\nuser base, and these estimates are subject to change due to improvements or revisions to our methodology. From time to time,\nwe review our metrics and may discover inaccuracies or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in\nadjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other\nfactors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments.\nWe may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully.\nThe intense competition we face, in addition to general and economic business conditions (including economic volatility, bank\nfailures, and high inflation and interest rates, among other things), may put pressure on us to change our pricing practices. If our\ncompetitors offer deep discounts on certain solutions, provide offerings, or offer free introductory products that compete with\nours, we may need to lower our prices or offer similar free introductory products to compete successfully. Similarly, if external\nfactors, such as economic conditions, market trends, or business combinations require us to raise our prices, our ability to\nacquire new customers and retain existing customers may be diminished. Any such changes may reduce revenue and margins\nand could adversely affect our financial results.\nAdditionally, changes in the macroeconomic environment have previously and may continue to affect our business. Our\nsolutions are discretionary purchases, and customers may reduce or eliminate their discretionary spending on our solutions\nduring a difficult macroeconomic environment. We may experience a material increase in cancellations by customers or a\nmaterial reduction in our retention rate in the future, especially in the event of a prolonged recession or a worsening of current\nconditions as a result of inflation, changes in interest rates, or other macroeconomic events. We may have to lower our prices or\nmake other changes to our pricing model to address these dynamics, any of which could adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nMany of Avira’s and Avast’s users are freemium subscribers, meaning they do not pay for its basic services. Much of our\nanticipated growth in connection with the Avira and Avast acquisitions are attributable to attracting and converting Avira’s and\nAvast’s freemium users to a paid subscription option. Numerous factors, however, have previously and may continue to impede\nour ability to attract and retain free users, convert these users into paying customers and retain them as paying customers.\nIf we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively, or if our partners choose not to market and sell\nour solutions to their customers, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nA portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels, including, but not limited to, distributors that sell our\nproducts to end-users and other resellers, and partners that incorporate our products into, or bundle our products with, their\nproducts. These channels involve risks, including:\n• Our resellers, distributors and telecom service providers are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any\nobligation to market our solutions to their customers;\n• Our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause and\nour partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due to\ncompetitive conditions in our markets and other factors;\n• Our resellers, distributors and OEMs may encounter issues or have violations of applicable law or regulatory requirements\nor otherwise cause damage to our reputation through their actions;\n• Our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing solutions and may, from time to time, place\ngreater emphasis on the sale of competing solutions due to pricing, promotions and other terms offered by our\ncompetitors;\n• Any consolidation of electronics retailers can increase their negotiating power with respect to software providers such as\nus and any decline in the number of physical retailers could decrease the channels of distribution for us;\n• The consolidation of online sales through a small number of larger channels has been increasing, which could reduce the\nchannels available for online distribution of our solutions; and\n• Sales through our partners are subject to changes in general economic conditions, strategic direction, competitive risks,\nand other issues that could result in fewer sales, or cause our partners to suffer financial difficulty which could delay\npayments to us, affecting our operating results.\nIf we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully, these channels may conflict with one another or\notherwise fail to perform as we anticipate, which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our\ncompetitive position.\nChanges in industry structure and market conditions have and may continue to lead to charges related to\ndiscontinuance of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments.\nIn response to changes in industry structure and market conditions, we have been and may continue to be required to\nstrategically reallocate our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting certain businesses. Any\ndecision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses has and may continue to result in the recording of\nspecial charges, such as technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess\n37\nTable of Contents\nfacilities, or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. Our estimates with respect to the\nuseful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a\nresult of such assessments and decisions. Our loss contingencies have and may continue to include liabilities for contracts that\nwe cannot cancel, reschedule or adjust with suppliers.\nFurther, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions.\nAdditionally, we are required to evaluate goodwill impairment on an annual basis and between annual evaluations in certain\ncircumstances. Goodwill impairment evaluations have previously and may result in a charge to earnings.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\nOur international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses, adversely affect our operating results\nand require increased time and attention of our management.\nFollowing the acquisition of Avast, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the\nUnited States, and we have substantial operations outside of the United States, including engineering, finance, sales and\ncustomer support. Our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations,\nincluding:\n• Difficulties staffing, managing, and coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse\noperations;\n• Potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual\nproperty rights than U.S. laws or that may not be adequately enforced;\n• Requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls, including tariffs, trade barriers and labor restrictions, and\nrelated laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operations;\n• Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, economic instability and inflationary conditions could make our solutions more\nexpensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries;\n• Potential changes in trade relations arising from policy initiatives or other political factors;\n• Regulations or restrictions on the use, import or export of encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the\nacceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications;\n• Local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that\nwe are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations;\n• Central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash\nin international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the United States;\n• Limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest\nsufficiently in our international operations;\n• Difficulties in staffing, managing and operating our international operations;\n• Costs and delays associated with developing software and providing support in multiple languages;\n• Political, social or economic unrest, war, terrorism, regional natural disasters, or export controls and trade restrictions,\nparticularly in areas in which we have facilities; and\n• Multiple and possibly overlapping tax regimes.\nThe expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets has required and will\ncontinue to require significant management attention and financial resources. These increased costs may increase our cost of\nacquiring international customers, which may delay our ability to achieve profitability or reduce our profitability in the future. We\nalso have and may continue to face pressure to lower our prices in order to compete in emerging markets, which has previously\nand could in the future adversely affect revenue derived from our international operations.\nIt is not possible to predict the broader consequences of geopolitical conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the\nnumerous conflicts in the Middle East, and other conflicts that may arise in the future, which could include geopolitical instability\nand uncertainty; adverse impacts on global and regional economic conditions and financial markets, including significant volatility\nin credit, capital, and currency markets; reduced economic activity; changes in laws and regulations affecting our business,\nincluding further sanctions or counter-sanctions which may be enacted; and increased cybersecurity threats and concerns. The\nultimate extent to which such conflicts may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations will\ndepend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, difficult to predict and subject to change.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key management, technical (including cyber security and AI\nexperts), sales, marketing, e-commerce, finance, and other personnel. Our officers and other key personnel are “at will”\nemployees and we generally do not have employment or non-compete agreements with our employees. Competition is\n38\nTable of Contents\nsignificant for people with the specific skills that we require, including in the areas of AI and machine learning, and especially in\nthe locations where we have a substantial presence and need for such personnel.\nIn order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace, we must provide competitive pay packages, including\ncash and equity-based compensation. Additionally, changes in immigration laws could impair our ability to attract and retain\nhighly qualified employees. If we fail to attract, retain and motivate new or existing personnel, our business, results of operations\nand future growth prospects could suffer. Volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or\nretain employees. In addition, we may not have an adequate number of shares reserved under our equity compensation plans,\nforcing us to reduce awards of equity-based compensation, which could impair our efforts to attract, retain and motivate\nnecessary personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees, or conversely, if we fail to manage employee\nperformance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions, our business and operating results could be adversely\naffected.\nEffective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge\nand smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. From time to time, key\npersonnel leave our company and the frequency and number of such departures have widely varied and have, in the past,\nresulted, and may in the future result in significant changes to our executive leadership team. The loss of any key employee\ncould result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the\nsuccessful implementation and completion of company initiatives, our internal control over financial reporting and our results of\noperations. In addition, hiring, training and successfully integrating replacement personnel can be time consuming and\nexpensive, may cause additional disruptions to our operations and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future\nfinancial results.\nOur solutions, systems, websites and the data on these sources have been in the past and may continue to be\nsubject to cybersecurity events that could materially harm our reputation and future sales.\nWe expect to continue to be a target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance and availability of our\nofferings and harm our reputation as a leading cyber security company. In addition, we face the risk of cyberattacks by nation-\nstates and state-sponsored actors, which may increase or heighten due to geopolitical tensions. These attacks may target us,\nour partners, suppliers, vendors or customers. Similarly, experienced computer programmers or other sophisticated individuals or\nentities, including malicious hackers, state-sponsored organizations, and insider threats including actions by employees and\nthird-party service providers, have attempted to penetrate, and in some cases have penetrated, our network security or the\nsecurity of our vendors or suppliers. Such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication, including through\nthe use of AI, and have in the past and could in the future expose us and the affected parties, to risk of loss or misuse of\nproprietary, personal or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations.\nIn addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating\ninternally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies.\nWe also remain vigilant with the increasing use of generative AI models in our internal systems which may create new attack\nmethods for adversaries. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new\nthreats emerge, or new cybersecurity regulations emerge in jurisdictions worldwide.\nWhen a data breach occurs, our information technology systems and infrastructure can be subject to damage, compromise,\ndisruption, and shutdown due to attacks or breaches by hackers or other circumstances, such as error or malfeasance by\nemployees or third-party service providers, phishing, social engineering, account takeovers, vulnerability exploitation,\nmisconfigurations, ransomware, or technology malfunction. A data breach may result in significant legal, financial, and\nreputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. A series of breaches\nmay be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their\noccurrence. The occurrence of any of these events, as well as a failure to promptly remedy them when they occur, could\ncompromise our systems and the information stored in our systems. Any such circumstance could adversely affect our ability to\nattract and maintain customers as well as strategic partners, cause us to suffer negative publicity or damage to our brand, and\nsubject us to legal claims and liabilities or regulatory penalties. In addition, unauthorized parties might alter information in our\ndatabases, which would adversely affect both the reliability of that information and our ability to market and perform our services\nas well as undermine our ability to remain compliant with relevant laws and regulations. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized\naccess or to sabotage systems change frequently, are constantly evolving and generally are difficult to recognize and react to\neffectively. We are not always able to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate or timely preventive or reactive\nmeasures. Several recent, highly publicized data security breaches, such as the large-scale attacks by foreign nation state\nactors, the global incident involving the MOVEit file transfer software, and a significant uptick in ransomware/extortion attacks at\nother companies, have heightened consumer awareness of this issue and may embolden individuals or groups to target our\nsystems or those of our strategic partners or enterprise customers. Threat actors have previously and could in the future exploit a\nnew vulnerability before we complete our remediation work or identify a vulnerability that we did not effectively remediate. If that\nhappens, there could be unauthorized access to, or acquisition of, data we maintain, and damage to our systems.\nWe could also face legal action from individuals, business partners, and regulators in connection with data breaches, which\nwould result in increased costs and fees incurred in our defense against those proceedings, and/or payment of any regulatory\npenalties\nWe collect, use, disclose, store or otherwise process personal information, which subjects us to privacy and data\nsecurity laws and contractual commitments.\nWe collect, use, process, store, transmit or disclose (collectively, process) an increasingly large amount of confidential\ninformation, including personal information (which includes credit card information and other critical data from employees and\n39\nTable of Contents\ncustomers), in connection with the operation of our business, particularly in relation to our identity and information protection\nservice offerings.\nThe confidential and personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local and foreign\nlaws regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply\nwith such obligations has previously and may in the future result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, litigation or public\nstatements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could\nhave an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nAdditionally, changes to applicable privacy or data security laws could impact how we process personal information and\ntherefore limit the effectiveness of our solutions or our ability to develop new solutions. For example, the European Union\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for\nnoncompliance of up to the greater of €20 million or four percent of our worldwide annual revenues.\nData protection legislation is also increasing in the U.S. at both the federal and state level. For example, the California\nConsumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA) requires, among other things, covered companies to provide disclosures to California\nconsumers regarding the use of personal information, gives California residents expanded rights to access their personal\ninformation that has been collected and allows such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information.\nFurther, the California Privacy Rights Act (the CPRA) significantly modifies the CCPA and there are new similar and overlapping\nstate privacy laws in at least 10 other U.S. states, which all go into effect by January 1, 2026. These new laws may result in\nadditional uncertainty and require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our effort to comply. Additionally, the Federal\nTrade Commission (the FTC) and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to\nimpose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. The burdens imposed by the new state\nprivacy laws and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our data\nprocessing practices and policies, adapt our goods and services and incur substantial expenditures in order to comply.\nGlobal privacy and data protection legislation and enforcement are rapidly expanding and evolving, and may be inconsistent\nfrom jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We may be or become subject to data localization laws mandating that data collected in a foreign\ncountry be processed and stored only or primarily within that country. If any country in which we have customers were to adopt a\ndata localization law, we could be required to expand our data storage facilities there or build new ones in order to comply. The\nexpenditure this would require, as well as costs of compliance generally, could harm our financial condition.\nAdditionally, third parties with whom we work, such as vendors or developers, may violate applicable laws or our policies and\nsuch violations can place the personal information of our customers at risk. In addition, our customers may also accidentally\ndisclose their passwords or store them on a device that is lost or stolen, creating the perception that our systems are not secure\nagainst third-party access. This could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. In addition, such third parties could\nexpose us to compromised data or technology, or be the target of cyberattack and other data breaches which could impact our\nsystems or our customers’ records and personal information. Further, we could be the target of a cyberattack or other action that\nimpacts our systems and results in a data breach of our customers’ records and personal information. This could have an\nadverse effect on our reputation and business and potentially result in litigation and/or regulatory penalties.\nOur inability to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity event could impair our ability to\ndeliver our products and services and harm our business.\nWe are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers. For\nexample, we host many of our products using third-party data center facilities and we do not control the operation of these\nfacilities. These facilities are vulnerable to damage, interference, interruption or performance problems from earthquakes,\nhurricanes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, pandemics and similar events. They are also subject to break-\nins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. The occurrence of a natural disaster, an act\nof terrorism state-sponsored attacks, a pandemic, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, and similar events could result in a\ndecision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems, which in turn, could result in lengthy\ninterruptions in the delivery of our products and services, which could negatively impact our sales and operating results.\nFurthermore, our business administration, human resources, compliance efforts and finance services depend on the proper\nfunctioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. A disruption or failure of these\nsystems or operations because of a disaster, cyberattack or other business continuity event, such as a pandemic, could cause\ndata to be lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers. In\naddition, we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis, and deficiencies may arise in our\ninternal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results, all of which could adversely\naffect the trading value of our stock. There are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster would be effective or\noccur in an efficient manner. If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to\nexpend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.\nWe are dependent upon Broadcom for certain engineering and threat response services, which are critical to many\nof our products and business.\nOur Norton branded endpoint security solution has historically relied upon certain threat analytics software engines and other\nsoftware (the Engine-Related Services) that have been developed and provided by engineering teams that have transferred to\nBroadcom as part of the Broadcom sale. The technology, including source code, at issue is shared, and pursuant to the terms of\nthe Broadcom sale, we retain rights to use, modify, enhance and create derivative works from such technology. Broadcom has\n40\nTable of Contents\ncommitted to provide these Engine-Related Services substantially to the same extent and in substantially the same manner, as\nhas been historically provided under a license agreement with a limited term.\nAs a result, we are dependent on Broadcom for services and technology that are critical to our business, and if Broadcom\nfails to deliver these Engine-Related Services it would result in significant business disruption, and our business and operating\nresults and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, if our current sources become\nunavailable, and if we are unable to develop or obtain alternatives to integrate or deploy them in time, our ability to compete\neffectively could be impacted and have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, in connection with the Broadcom\nsale, we lost other capabilities, including certain threat intelligence data which were historically provided by our former Enterprise\nSecurity business, the lack of which could have a negative impact on our business and products.\nIf we fail to offer high-quality customer support, our customer satisfaction may suffer and have a negative impact on\nour business and reputation.\nMany of our customers rely on our customer support services to resolve issues, including technical support, billing and\nsubscription issues, that may arise. If demand increases, or our resources decrease, we may be unable to offer the level of\nsupport our customers expect. Any failure by us to maintain the expected level of support could reduce customer satisfaction and\nnegatively impact our customer retention and our business.\nOur solutions are complex and operate in a wide variety of environments, systems and configurations, which could\nresult in failures of our solutions to function as designed.\nBecause we offer very complex solutions, errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance problems with our solutions may\noccur and have occurred. For example, we may experience disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a\nvariety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, fraud, security attacks or capacity constraints due\nto an overwhelming number of users accessing our websites simultaneously. In some instances, we may not be able to identify\nthe cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. Interruptions in our solutions could\nimpact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to\nprotect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive\neffect on our operations. We could potentially lose customer data or personal information, or experience material adverse\ninterruptions to our operations or delivery of solutions to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario.\nNegative publicity regarding our brand, solutions and business could harm our competitive position.\nOur brand recognition and reputation as a trusted service provider are critical aspects of our business and key to retaining\nexisting customers and attracting new customers. Our business could be harmed due to errors, defects, disruptions or other\nperformance problems with our solutions causing our customers and potential customers to believe our solutions are unreliable.\nFurthermore, negative publicity, whether or not justified, including intentional brand misappropriation, relating to events or\nactivities attributed to us, our employees, our strategic partners, our affiliates, or others associated with any of these parties, may\ntarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. In addition, the rapid rise and use of social media has the potential to\nharm our brand and reputation. We may be unable to timely respond to and resolve negative and inaccurate social media posts\nregarding our company, solutions and business in an appropriate manner. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity\nmay reduce demand for our solutions and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nMoreover, any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands may be costly and time consuming, and\nsuch efforts may not ultimately be successful.\nOur reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.\nThe focus from regulators, customers, certain investors, employees, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social\nand governance (ESG) matters and related disclosures, both in the United States and internationally, has resulted in, and is likely\nto continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent\ncomplying with or meeting ESG-related requirements and expectations. For example, developing and acting on ESG-related\ninitiatives and collecting, measuring and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time\nconsuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC’s climate-related reporting requirements and the\nrecent California legislation, which includes disclosure requirements relating to voluntary carbon offsets and a wide range of\nenvironmental marketing claims. Similarly, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive will require large EU companies to\nmake detailed disclosures in relation to certain sustainability-related issues. We communicate certain ESG-related initiatives,\ngoals, and/or commitments regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments and other\nmatters on our website, in our filings with the SEC, and elsewhere. These initiatives, goals or commitments could be difficult to\nachieve and costly to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at\na sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the disclosure. Further, statements\nabout our ESG-related initiatives, goals or commitments and progress with respect to such initiatives, goals or commitments may\nbe based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve,\nand assumptions that are subject to change in the future. In addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of\nthese initiatives, goals or commitments, or for any revisions to them. If we fail to achieve progress with respect to our ESG-\nrelated initiatives, goals or commitments on a timely basis, or at all, or if our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are\nincomplete or inaccurate, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.\nWe are affected by seasonality, which may impact our revenue and results of operations.\nPortions of our business are impacted by seasonality. Seasonal behavior in orders has historically occurred in the third and\nfourth quarters of our fiscal year, which include the important selling periods during the holidays in our third quarter, as well as\n41\nTable of Contents\nfollow-on holiday purchases and the U.S. tax filing season, which is typically in our fourth quarter. Revenue generally reflects\nsimilar seasonal patterns, but to a lesser extent than orders. This is due to our subscription business model, as a large portion of\nour in-period revenue is recognized ratably from our deferred revenue balance. An unexpected decrease in sales over those\ntraditionally high-volume selling periods may impact our revenue and could have a disproportionate effect on our results of\noperations for the entire fiscal year.\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nOur solutions are highly regulated, which could impede our ability to market and provide our solutions or adversely\naffect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nOur solutions are subject to a high degree of regulation, including a wide variety of international and U.S. federal, state, and\nlocal laws and regulations, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Federal Trade Commission\nAct (the FTC Act), and comparable state laws that are patterned after the FTC Act. We have previously entered into consent\ndecrees and similar arrangements with the FTC and the attorney generals of 35 states as well as a settlement with the FTC\nrelating to allegations that certain of LifeLock’s advertising, marketing and security practices constituted deceptive acts or\npractices in violation of the FTC Act, which impose additional restrictions on our business, including prohibitions against making\nany misrepresentation of “the means, methods, procedures, effects, effectiveness, coverage, or scope of” our solutions. We\nsigned an Undertaking, effective June 14, 2021, with the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) requiring\nour NortonLifeLock Ireland Limited and NortonLifeLock UK entities to make certain changes to their policies and practices related\nto automatically renewing subscriptions in the United Kingdom as part of the CMA’s investigation into auto-renewal practices in\nthe antivirus sector launched in December 2018. Any of the laws and regulations that apply to our business are subject to\nrevision or new or changed interpretations, and we cannot predict the impact of such changes on our business.\nAdditionally, the nature of our identity and information protection products subjects us to the broad regulatory, supervisory and\nenforcement powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which may exercise authority with respect to our services, or\nthe marketing and servicing of those services, through the oversight of our financial institution or credit reporting agency\ncustomers and suppliers, or by otherwise exercising its supervisory, regulatory or enforcement authority over consumer financial\nproducts and services.\nIf we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our\nproducts and technology, our financial results could be harmed.\nMuch of our software and underlying technology is proprietary. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a\ncombination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws.\nHowever, these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties.\nThird parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain, use, distribute and sell our proprietary information\nwithout authorization.\nPatents may also not be issued from our pending patent applications and claims allowed on any future issued patents may\nnot be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Also, these protections may not preclude competitors from independently\ndeveloping products with functionality or features similar to our products.\nThird parties have previously and may in the future also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing\naround our patents. Our consumer agreements do not require a signature and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of\nsome jurisdictions. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary\nrights as the laws of the United States, and we may be subject to the unauthorized use of our products in those countries. The\nunauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products. Any legal\naction to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely\naffect our ability to access software, operating system and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor, or cause such partner\nor vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers. In addition, any legal action to protect proprietary information\nthat we may bring or be engaged in, could be costly, may distract management from day-to-day operations and may lead to\nadditional claims against us, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nFrom time to time we are party to lawsuits and investigations, and third parties have claimed and additional third\nparties in the future may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights, which has previously and could in the future\nrequire significant management time and attention, cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from\nselling our products.\nWe are frequently involved in litigation and other proceedings, including, but not limited to, class actions and governmental\nclaims or investigations, some of which may be material initially or become material over time. The expense of initiating and\ndefending, and in some cases settling, such matters may be costly and divert management’s attention from the day-to-day\noperations of our business, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, such matters may through the course of litigation or other proceedings change unfavorably which could alter the\nprofile of the matter and create potential material risk to the company. Any unfavorable outcome in a matter could result in\nsignificant fines, settlements, monetary damages, or injunctive relief that could negatively and materially impact our ability to\nconduct our business, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, in the event we did not previously accrue for such\nlitigation or proceeding in our financial statements, we may be required to record retrospective accruals that adversely affect our\nresults of operations and financial condition.\n42\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, third parties have claimed and, from time to time, additional third parties may claim that we have infringed their\nintellectual property rights, including claims regarding patents, copyrights and trademarks. For additional information on such\nclaims, please refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nBecause of constant technological change in the segments in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing\ntechnologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that the number of these claims may grow. In addition,\nformer employers of our former, current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed\nto us confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could result in\ncostly litigation and distract management from day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in defending such claims, we could\nbe required to stop selling, delay shipments of, or redesign our solutions, pay monetary amounts as damages, enter into royalty\nor licensing arrangements, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our partners. We cannot assure you\nthat any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially\nreasonable terms or at all. We have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to investigate, defend and\nsettle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk.\nIn addition, we license and use software from third parties in our business and generally must rely on those third parties to\nprotect the licensed rights. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at\nall and may expose us to additional liability. This liability, or our inability to use any of this third-party software, could result in\ndelivery delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nSome of our products contain “open source” software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of\nthese open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nCertain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under so-called “open\nsource” licenses. Some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or\nderivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works\nunder the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. By the\nterms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine\nour proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner. Some open source software may include generative\nartificial intelligence (AI) software or other software that incorporates or relies on generative AI. The use of such software may\nexpose us to risks as the intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, of generative AI software and\ntools, has not been fully interpreted by U.S. courts or been fully addressed by federal, state, or international regulations. In\naddition to risks related to license requirements, using open source software, including open source software that incorporates or\nrelies on generative AI, can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally\ndo not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks,\nincluding a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source. However, we\ncannot be sure that all open source, including open source that incorporates or relies on generative AI, is submitted for approval\nprior to use in our products. In addition, many of the risks associated with usage of open source, including open source that\nincorporates or relies on generative AI, may not or cannot be eliminated and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect\nour business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR LIQUIDITY AND INDEBTEDNESS\nThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial\ncondition.\nAs of September 27, 2024, we had an aggregate of $8,628 million of outstanding indebtedness that will mature in calendar\nyears 2025 through 2030, and $1,490 million, net of our letters of credit, available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor further information on our outstanding debt. Our ability to meet expenses, comply with the covenants under our debt\ninstruments, pay interest and repay principal for our substantial level of indebtedness depends on, among other things, our\noperating performance, competitive developments, and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by\nfinancial, business, economic and other factors. We are not able to control many of these factors. Accordingly, our cash flow may\nnot be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt, including our 5.0% Senior Notes due 2025, 6.75% Senior\nNotes due 2027 and 7.125% Senior Notes due 2030 (collectively, the Senior Notes), and meet our other obligations. Our level of\nindebtedness could have other important consequences, including the following:\n• We must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on the Amended Credit\nAgreement, our existing Senior Notes, and other indebtedness, which reduces funds available to us for other purposes\nsuch as working capital, capital expenditures, other general corporate purposes and potential acquisitions;\n• We may be unable to refinance our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures,\nacquisitions or general corporate purposes;\n• We have significant exposure to fluctuations in interest rates because borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities\nbear interest at variable rates;\n• Our leverage may be greater than that of some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and\nreduce our flexibility in responding to current and changing industry and financial market conditions;\n• We may be more vulnerable to an economic downturn or recession and adverse developments in our business;\n43\nTable of Contents\n• We may be unable to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt agreements, which could result in an event of\ndefault that, if not cured or waived, may result in acceleration of certain of our debt and would have an adverse effect on\nour business and prospects and could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation; and\n• Changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of our debt and/or our\ncommon stock, adversely affect our access to debt markets and increase the interest we pay on outstanding or future\ndebt.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. In addition, we conduct a\nsignificant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness will be dependent in\npart on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their respective abilities to make such cash available to us by\ndividend, debt repayment or otherwise, which may not always be possible. If we do not receive distributions from our\nsubsidiaries, we may be unable to make the required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nOur Amended Credit Agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions on us.\nOur Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n• Incur additional debt;\n• Create liens on certain assets to secure debt;\n• Enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions;\n• Pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; and\n• Consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, meet or otherwise address our capital needs,\npursue business opportunities, react to market conditions or may otherwise restrict activities or business plans. A breach of any\nof these covenants could result in a default. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could declare the indebtedness, together\nwith accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and, to the extent such indebtedness is secured,\nproceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness.\nThe failure of financial institutions or transactional counterparties could adversely affect our current and projected\nbusiness operations and our financial condition and result of operations.\nWe regularly maintain cash balances with other financial institutions in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. A failure of a\ndepository institution to return deposits could result in a loss or impact access to our invested cash or cash equivalents and could\nadversely impact our operating liquidity and financial performance.\nAdditionally, future adverse developments with respect to specific financial institutions or the broader financial services\nindustry may lead to market-wide liquidity shortages, impair the ability of companies to access near-term working capital needs,\nand create additional market and economic uncertainty. Our general business strategy, including our ability to access existing\ndebt under the terms of our Amended Credit Agreement may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, liquidity\nshortages, volatile business environment or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the current equity and\ncredit markets deteriorate, or if adverse developments are experienced by financial institutions, it may cause short-term liquidity\nrisk and also make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly, more onerous with respect to financial and\noperating covenants and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms\ncould have a material adverse effect on our operations, growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require\nus to alter our operating plans.\nHedging or other mitigation actions to mitigate against interest rate exposure may adversely affect our earnings,\nlimit our gains or result in losses, which could adversely affect cash available for distributions.\nWe have previously and may in the future enter into interest rate swap agreements or pursue other interest rate hedging\nstrategies. In March 2023, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate risks associated with the variable interest\nrate of our Term A Facility. These pay-fixed, receive-floating rate interest rate swaps have the economic effect of hedging the\nvariability of forecasted interest payments until their maturity on March 31, 2026. Pursuant to the agreements, we have\neffectively converted $1 billion of our variable rate borrowings under Term A Facility to fixed rates, with $500 million at a fixed rate\nof 3.762% and $500 million at a fixed rate of 3.550%. The objective of our interest rate swaps, all of which are designated as\ncash flow hedges, is to manage the variability of future cash interest expense.\nOur future hedging activity will vary in scope based on the level of interest rates, the type and expected duration of portfolio\ninvestments held, and other changing market conditions. Our current and future interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could\nadversely affect us because, among other things:\n• Interest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates;\n• Available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought;\n• The duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability or asset;\n• The credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability\nto sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction;\n• The party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay; and\n44\nTable of Contents\n• We may purchase a hedge that turns out not to be necessary (i.e., a hedge that is out of the money).\nAny hedging activity we engage in may adversely affect our earnings, which could adversely affect cash available for\ndistributions. Unanticipated changes in interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not\nengaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments\nused in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged or liabilities being hedged may vary\nmaterially. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging\ninstruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended\nhedge and expose us to risk of loss.\nGENERAL RISKS\nGovernment efforts to combat inflation, along with other interest rate pressures arising from an inflationary\neconomic environment, have led to and may continue to lead to higher financing costs.\nWe operate globally and as a result our business and revenues are impacted by global macroeconomic conditions. Inflation\nhas risen on a global basis, including in the United States, and government entities have taken various actions to combat\ninflation, such as raising interest rate benchmarks. While the Federal Reserve has recently held inflation rates steady, global\ninflation remains high and government entities may continue their efforts, or implement additional efforts, to combat inflation,\nwhich may include continuing to raise interest rate benchmarks or maintaining interest rate benchmarks at elevated levels. Such\ngovernment efforts, along with other interest rate pressures arising from an inflationary economic environment, have led to higher\nfinancing costs. For example, recent elevated interest rates have resulted in an increase in our cost of debt. These government\nactions and global macroeconomic conditions have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the trading price of our stock in the past and could affect\nthe trading price of our stock in the future.\nOur quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary in the future due to a number of factors, many\nof which are outside of our control. If our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet our\nexpectations or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, the trading price of our outstanding securities could be\nnegatively affected. Volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or\npursue acquisitions. Factors associated with our industry, the operation of our business, and the markets for our solutions may\ncause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate, including but not limited to:\n• Fluctuations in demand for our solutions;\n• Disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused by, among other things, terrorism or other intentional\nacts, outbreaks of disease, or earthquakes, floods or other natural disasters;\n• Entry of new competition into our markets;\n• Technological changes in our markets;\n• Our ability to achieve targeted operating income and margins and revenues;\n• Competitive pricing pressure or free offerings that compete with one or more of our solutions;\n• Our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced versions of our solutions;\n• The amount and timing of commencement and termination of major marketing campaigns;\n• The number, severity and timing of threat outbreaks and cyber security incidents;\n• Loss of customers or strategic partners or the inability to acquire new customers or cross-sell our solutions;\n• Changes in the mix or type of solutions and subscriptions sold and changes in consumer retention rates;\n• The rate of adoption of new technologies and new releases of operating systems, and new business processes;\n• Consumer confidence and spending changes;\n• The outcome or impact of litigation, claims, disputes, regulatory inquiries or investigations;\n• The impact of acquisitions (and our ability to achieve expected synergies or attendant cost savings), divestitures,\nrestructurings, share repurchase, financings, debt repayments, equity investments and other investment activities;\n• Changes in U.S. and worldwide economic conditions, such as economic recessions, the impact of inflation, fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates including the weakening of foreign currencies relative to USD, which has and may in the\nfuture negatively affect our revenue expressed in USD, changes in interest rates, geopolitical conflicts and other global\nmacroeconomic factors on our operations and financial performance;\n• The publication of unfavorable or inaccurate research reports about our business by cybersecurity industry analysts;\n• The success of our ESG initiatives;\n• Changes in tax laws, rules and regulations;\n• Changes in tax rates, benefits and expenses; and\n• Changes in consumer protection laws and regulations.\n45\nTable of Contents\nAny of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our outstanding securities to fluctuate significantly.\nRISKS RELATED TO TAXES\nChanges to our effective tax rate, including through the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional\nincome tax liabilities, could increase our income tax expense and reduce (increase) our net income (loss), cash flows\nand working capital. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.\nWe are a multinational company dual headquartered in the U.S. and the Czech Republic, with our principal executive offices\nin Tempe, Arizona. As such, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could\nbe adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n• Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws, including the potential for federal tax law changes put forward by Congress\nand the current administration including potentially increased corporate tax rates, new minimum taxes and other changes\nto the way that our US tax liability has been calculated following the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Certain of these\nproposals could have significant retroactive adjustments adding cash tax payments/liabilities if adopted;\n• Changes to other tax laws, regulations, and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, including actions\nresulting from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) base erosion and profit shifting\nproject including recent proposals for a global minimum tax rate, proposed actions by international bodies such as digital\nservices taxation, as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings. In October 2021, the OECD/G20 inclusive framework\non Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the Inclusive Framework) published a statement updating and finalizing the key\ncomponents of a two-pillar plan on global tax reform which has now been agreed upon by the majority of OECD members.\nOECD and many countries have proposed to reallocate a portion of profits of large multinational enterprises (MNE), with\nan annual global turnover exceeding €20 billion to markets where sales arise (Pillar One), as well as enact a global\nminimum tax rate of 15% for MNE with an annual global turnover exceeding €750 million (Pillar Two). On December 12,\n2022, the European Union reached an agreement to implement the Pillar Two Directive of the OECD’s reform of\ninternational taxation at the European Union level. The agreement affirms that all Member States must transpose the\nDirective by December 31, 2023. The rules will therefore first be applicable for fiscal years starting on or after December\n31, 2023. Ireland, Czech Republic and certain jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted legislation to implement\nPillar Two and other countries are actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD’s\nproposals. The enactment of Pillar Two legislation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our effective tax\nrate and Consolidated Financial Statements in the near term. We will continue to monitor and reflect the impact of such\nlegislative changes in future financial statements as appropriate;\n• Changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate\nthat have differing statutory tax rates;\n• Changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax\nreturn preparation process;\n• The ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision\nwe have recorded or reserved for;\n• The tax effects of, and tax planning and changes in tax rates related to significant infrequently occurring events (including\nacquisitions, divestitures and restructurings) that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods;\n• Tax assessments, or any related tax interest or penalties, that could significantly affect our income tax expense for the\nperiod in which the settlements take place; and\n• Taxes arising in connection to changes in our workforce, corporate and legal entity structure or operations as they relate to\ntax incentives and tax rates.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices that a tax authority in a particular jurisdiction believes that we owe a greater amount of\ntax than we have reported to such authority and we are consequently subject to tax audits. These audits can involve complex\nissues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Additionally, our ability to\nrecognize the financial statement benefit of tax refund claims is subject to change based on a number of factors, including but\nnot limited to, changes in facts and circumstances, changes in tax laws, correspondence with tax authorities, and the results of\ntax audits and related proceedings, which may take several years or more to resolve. If tax authorities disagree with certain tax\nreporting positions taken by us, as a result, they assess additional taxes against us. We are regularly engaged in discussions\nand sometimes disputes with these tax authorities. We ultimately sometimes have to engage in litigation to achieve the results\nreflected in our tax estimates, and such litigation can be time consuming and expensive. We regularly assess the likely outcomes\nof any audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any\nof these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for, our operating results, cash\nflows, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur corporate and legal entity structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various\njurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which would harm our results of operations.\nWe generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries and are or may be required to report\nour taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Our\nintercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various\njurisdictions. The amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on a variety of factors including the application of\nthe tax laws of those various jurisdictions (including the U.S.) to our international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or\n46\nTable of Contents\nrevised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent\nwith our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The relevant taxing authorities have in the past and may in the\nfuture disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a\ndisagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and\npenalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability\nof our operations.\nAny changes or interpretations to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may cause\nfluctuations in our reported results of operations or affect how we conduct our business.\nA change in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices could have a significant effect on our reported results\nand may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements, taxation\nrules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation rules have occurred in the past and may occur in the\nfuture. We could be required to modify a current tax or accounting position as a result of any such change, and this could\nadversely affect our reported financial results and could change the way we conduct our business.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nRepurchase of equity securities\nIn May 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program through which we may repurchase shares of\nour common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $3 billion with no fixed expiration. Under our stock repurchase program,\nshares may be repurchased on the open market and through accelerated stock repurchase transactions. As of September 27,\n2024, we have $2,728 million remaining authorized to be completed in future periods with no expiration date. No shares were\nrepurchased during the three months ended September 27, 2024.\nItem 5. Other Information\nInsider adoption or termination of trading arrangements\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended September 27, 2024, none of our directors or officers informed us of the adoption or\ntermination of a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as defined in Regulation S-K,\nItem 408, except as described in the table below:\nTrading Arrangement\nRule Non-Rule Total Shares to be\nName Title Action Date 10b5-1(1) 10b5-1(2) Sold Expiration Date(3)\nUp to 101,208\nBryan Ko Chief Legal Officer Adopt August 27, 2024 X shares August 27, 2025\n(1) Intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c).\n(2) Non-Rule Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\n(3) Except as indicated by footnote, each trading arrangement permitted or permits transactions through and including the earlier of (i) the\ncompletion of all purchases or sales; (ii) the date listed in the table; or (iii) such date the arrangement is otherwise terminated according to\nits terms.\n47\nTable of Contents\nItem 6.
