The Letter has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s ordinary shares or warrants on Nasdaq. The Letter stated that, under Nasdaq rules, the Company has until 60 calendar days after receipt of the Letter, which is January 21, 2025, to submit a plan to regain compliance, and that if a plan is submitted and accepted, Nasdaq could grant the Company an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the filing’s due date, or until May 14, 2025, to regain compliance. If Nasdaq does not accept the Company’s plan, then the Company will have the opportunity to appeal that decision to a Nasdaq hearings panel. The Company continues to work diligently to file its Annual Report as promptly as practical to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1).\n\n**About Carbon Revolution plc**\n\nCarbon Revolution plc (Nasdaq: CREV) (the “Company” or “Carbon Revolution”) is the parent of Carbon Revolution Pty Ltd, an early-stage growth company which has successfully innovated, commercialized and industrialized the advanced manufacture of carbon fiber wheels for the global automotive industry. The Company has progressed from single prototypes to designing and manufacturing lightweight wheels for cars and SUVs in the high performance, premium and luxury segments, for the world’s most prestigious automotive brands.

In connection with the release the Company issued to OIC a warrant to purchase a number of shares equal to 2.5% of the Company’s shares outstanding.\n\nProceeds from the OIC investment will be used to fund operations and investments in capacity in the near term.\n\nThe release of funds from escrow is the final release of the aggregate of US$35 million funded by OIC into escrow in connection with the closing of the Company’s business combination in November 2023. The Company currently does not have any additional committed financing, as the original Securities Purchase Agreement by and between the Company and OIC provides for up to US$40 million of additional funding by OIC for the purpose of funding a future manufacturing facility or material upgrades to the existing Australian facility. The Company continues to work with OIC to secure additional funding to support near-term liquidity requirements and is now in discussions with OIC in relation to the provision of some or all of US$40 million of additional funds for ongoing operations and incremental capacity expansion at the existing facility. Such funding is subject to the Company and OIC reaching agreement on the terms and conditions for such funding, and receipt of such funding will likely be dependent on the Company meeting performance milestones specified in such agreement. Such funding will also require the agreement of the holders of the outstanding notes issued by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company pursuant to the New Debt Program arranged by PIUS Limited LLC and its affiliates. However, the Company makes no assurances that it will be able to reach agreement with OIC on such conditions and obtain such financing on acceptable terms, or at all, or that it will reach agreement with the holders of such outstanding notes, or that it will meet any agreed performance milestones.\n\n**About Carbon Revolution plc**\n\nCarbon Revolution plc (Nasdaq: CREV) (the “Company” or “Carbon Revolution”) is the parent of Carbon Revolution Pty Ltd, an early-stage growth company which has successfully innovated, commercialized and industrialized the advanced manufacture of carbon fiber wheels for the global automotive industry.
