          "content": "FIFTH AMENDED AND RESTATED\nCHARTER FOR THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE\nOF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nOF MICROSTRATEGY INCORPORATED\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the Compensation Committee is to oversee the discharge of the\nresponsibilities of the Board of Directors relating to compensation of the Company’s executive\nofficers and directors and undertake those specific duties and responsibilities listed below and\nsuch other duties as the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe. For purposes of this\nCharter, “executive officer” means any “officer” of the Company as defined under Rule 16a-1(f)\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nStructure and Membership\nExcept as otherwise required by applicable law or permitted by Nasdaq rules, the\nCompensation Committee shall consist of at least two members of the Board of Directors.\nExcept as otherwise permitted by applicable Nasdaq rules, each member of the Compensation\nCommittee shall be an “independent director” as defined by the applicable Nasdaq rules.\nThe members of the Compensation Committee shall be appointed by and shall serve at\nthe discretion of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may remove any member of the\nCompensation Committee from such committee, with or without cause.\nUnless the Board of Directors elects a Chair of the Compensation Committee, the\nCompensation Committee may elect a Chair by majority vote.\nThe compensation of Compensation Committee members shall be as determined by the\nBoard of Directors.\nAuthority and Responsibilities\nThe Compensation Committee shall discharge its responsibilities and shall assess the\ninformation provided by the Company’s management in accordance with its business judgment.\nThe Compensation Committee shall have the resources and authority necessary to discharge its\nresponsibilities. The Compensation Committee shall have, in its sole discretion, the authority to\nretain and terminate outside counsel, compensation consultants, and other experts or consultants\nas it deems necessary to assist it in discharging its responsibilities as the Compensation\nCommittee of the Board of Directors, and the authority to approve the fees and terms of\nengagement for such counsel, consultants, or experts and cause the Company to pay such fees\nwithout further action of the Board of Directors. In selecting such counsel, consultants, and\nexperts, the Compensation Committee shall take into consideration the factors affecting\nindependence that are specified in applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules. The Compensation\nCommittee shall be directly responsible for the oversight of the work of the counsel, consultants,\nand experts that it engages. Any communications between the Compensation Committee and\nlegal counsel in the course of obtaining legal advice shall be considered privileged\ncommunications of the Company and the Compensation Committee shall take all necessary steps\nto preserve the privileged nature of those communications.\nExecutive Officer Compensation. The Compensation Committee shall review and\napprove, or recommend for approval by the Board of Directors, the goals and objectives of the\nCompany’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and other executive officers and shall evaluate the\nperformance of such executive officers in light of those goals and objectives. The Compensation\nCommittee shall take into account those goals and objectives, the performance of the executive\nofficers, and such other factors as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate and in the\nbest interests of the Company in reviewing and approving, or recommending for approval by the\nBoard of Directors, the compensation of the Company’s executive officers, including salary,\nbonus, and incentive compensation levels; deferred compensation; executive perquisites; equity\ncompensation (including awards to induce employment); severance arrangements; change-in-\ncontrol benefits and other forms of compensation. The Compensation Committee shall meet\nwithout the presence of the CEO when voting or deliberating on CEO compensation.\nPlan Recommendations and Approvals. The Compensation Committee may periodically\nreview and make recommendations to the Board of Directors with respect to incentive-\ncompensation plans and equity-based plans. In addition, in the case of any tax-qualified, non-\ndiscriminatory employee benefit plans (and any parallel nonqualified plans) for which\nstockholder approval is not sought and pursuant to which options or stock of the Company may\nbe acquired by officers, directors, employees, or consultants of the Company, the Compensation\nCommittee, or a majority of the independent directors of the Board of Directors, shall approve\nsuch plans.\nAdministration of Plans. The Compensation Committee may exercise all rights, authority,\nand functions of the Board of Directors under all of the Company’s stock option, stock incentive,\nemployee stock purchase, and other equity-based plans, including without limitation, the\nauthority to interpret the terms thereof, to grant, amend, modify, or terminate options thereunder,\nand to make stock awards thereunder; provided, however, that, except as otherwise expressly\nauthorized to do so by this Charter, any such plan or a resolution of the Board of Directors, the\nCompensation Committee shall not be authorized to amend any such plan. To the extent\npermitted by applicable law and the provisions of a given equity-based plan, and consistent with\nthe requirements of applicable law and such equity-based plan, the Compensation Committee\nmay delegate to one or more persons (including officers of the Company) or bodies the power to\ngrant options or other stock awards pursuant to such equity-based plan to employees of the\nCompany or any subsidiary of the Company who are not directors or executive officers of the\nCompany. The Compensation Committee, or a majority of the independent directors of the\nBoard of Directors, shall approve any inducement awards granted in reliance on the exemption\nfrom stockholder approval contained in Nasdaq Rule 5635(c)(4).\nDirector Compensation. The Compensation Committee may periodically review and\nmake recommendations to the Board of Directors with respect to director compensation.\nCompensation Committee Report on Executive Compensation. The Compensation\nCommittee shall prepare an annual report of the Compensation Committee on executive\ncompensation for inclusion in the Company’s annual proxy statement on Schedule 14A in\naccordance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.\nOversight of Compensation Risk Management. The Compensation Committee shall be\nresponsible for the oversight of risks associated with the Company’s compensation policies and\npractices.

Such electronic\nfacilities include: (i) all of the Company’s computer and telecommunications networks and systems, such as telephone,\nInternet, and email, (ii) all of the Company’s computer and other electronic equipment, such as personal computers\nand mobile devices, and (iii) the content of the foregoing networks, systems, and equipment.\nYou should not abuse the Company’s electronic facilities by engaging in:\n• activities that disrupt or interfere with your work or the operation of the Company’s electronic facilities;\n• posting or transmitting unlawful, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, profane, or otherwise objectionable\ninformation of any kind, including without limitation any transmission constituting or encouraging conduct that\nwould constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any local, state, national or\ninternational law, including without limitation the U.S. export control laws and regulations;\n• illegal activities (including illegal software downloads); or\n• other activities that could reflect negatively on the Company.\nYou should take reasonable steps to safeguard Company electronic facilities that are assigned to you.\nIf you use the Company’s electronic facilities, you expressly consent to the monitoring of your activities.

A conflict of interest arises when you have a personal interest that influences or\nreasonably could be expected to influence your judgment or action in conducting the Company’s business. This may\nput your objectivity in doubt when working with customers, suppliers, partners, competitors, or government officials. It\nis your responsibility to disclose any transaction, relationship, or other circumstance that constitutes a conflict of interest\nfor you to the General Counsel, provided that if you are the General Counsel or an executive officer or director of\nMicroStrategy Incorporated, you should make such disclosure to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Any\nsuch transaction, relationship, or circumstance fully disclosed to, and expressly approved by, the General Counsel or\nthe Audit Committee, as applicable, shall be deemed not to violate this Code of Conduct.\nIt is not possible to enumerate all situations that may present a conflict of interest. The facts of each case will determine\nwhether there is a conflict. Such facts would include the amount of business involved, the extent to which you could\ninfluence the Company’s decisions or the other party’s decisions in the applicable matter, and the extent to which your\nobjectivity, business judgment, or loyalty are affected, regardless of any actual or potential personal gain. For example,\nfamily relationships might influence your judgment either to your personal advantage or to the undue advantage of a\nrelative. You must disclose to the General Counsel or the Audit Committee, as applicable, any circumstance in which\nyou are aware that a relative has an interest in any Company transaction or has a material ownership interest in a\ncustomer, supplier, partner, or competitor, to the extent that such circumstance constitutes a conflict of interest for you.\nGenerally, a material ownership interest will involve ownership of at least 5% of a company, although any ownership\nlevel coupled with other circumstances could constitute a conflict of interest for you if it would influence your objectivity,\nbusiness judgment or loyalty.\nIn addition to the foregoing, employees must comply with the following:\n• Employees must not engage in any consulting or employment relationship with, nor serve as a director, officer,\npartner, agent, or representative of, a customer, supplier, partner, or competitor of the Company without the\nspecific written approval of the General Counsel or the Audit Committee, as applicable.\n• Employees must not have a material ownership interest in any customer, supplier, partner, or competitor of\nthe Company without the specific written approval of the General Counsel or the Audit Committee, as\napplicable. (Again, a material ownership interest will generally involve ownership of at least 5% of a company,\nalthough any ownership level coupled with other circumstances could constitute a conflict of interest for you if\nit would influence your objectivity, business judgment or loyalty.)\nFor more information regarding MicroStrategy’s conflicts of interest/outside employment policies, please reference\nthe Employment Policies section of the MicroStrategy Employee Handbook.\nCorporate Opportunities\nEmployees must not appropriate, or divert to any other person or entity, a business or financial opportunity which the\nemployee learns of or develops in the course of employment and which the employee knows, or reasonably could\nanticipate, the Company would have an interest in pursuing.\n5\nSigning Agreements and Making Other Commitments that Bind the Company\nDue to the legally binding nature of agreements, representations, obligations, and other commitments, it is essential\nthat you adhere to Company guidelines for the signing of agreements and making other commitments on behalf of the\nCompany. You are not authorized to sign any agreements or make any other commitments on behalf of MicroStrategy\nunless MicroStrategy granted a power of attorney to you authorizing you to do so or you are otherwise specifically\nauthorized or designated by MicroStrategy to do so and you are acting in accordance with such authorization.\nFor more information regarding MicroStrategy's contracts policies, please reference the Contracts policies on\nMicroStrategy’s intranet site.\nRecording and Reporting Information\nUnder no circumstances may you report or record information that you know or suspect is false. It is a violation of\nCompany policy to make false statements or to conceal a material fact in any communication to the Company, including\nfinancial records, expense reports, employment or employee benefit applications, statements made in connection with\ninvestigations or litigation, and any governmental reports.\nFalse reporting of information to people and organizations outside the Company, including customers, is strictly\nprohibited. For example, this prohibition applies to reports to auditors or investors, documents submitted to or\nmaintained for government agencies, or documents containing product quality or pricing information. This prohibition\nis also critical in situations where the Company is selling goods to the government or to a customer that is selling goods\nto the government.\nPublic Communications\nThe following persons (collectively, the “Authorized Public Spokespersons”) are the only persons who are authorized\nto communicate on behalf of the Company by any means (for example, press interviews, press releases, electronic\nchat rooms, electronic discussion boards, social media forums, news groups, or any other forums accessible by persons\nother than Company employees and persons authorized by the Company) to the general public, the media, market\nprofessionals (e.g. securities analysts, institutional investors, investment advisers, brokers, and dealers), and\nsecurityholders:\n• Executive Chairman,\n• Chief Executive Officer,\n• President,\n• Chief Financial Officer,\n• General Counsel, and\n• their respective designees (but only in accordance with and to the extent provided by the applicable\ndesignation), including, but not limited to, the Chief Technology Officer and the Chief Marketing Officer.\nAuthorized Public Spokespersons may make disclosures of material non-public information only pursuant to a\nconfidentiality arrangement approved by the Legal Department or by such other means that, after consultation with the\nLegal Department, are believed to be in compliance with Regulation FD and other applicable laws and stock exchange\nrules.\nIf you are not an Authorized Public Spokesperson:\n• You must not communicate on behalf of the Company with the general public, the media, market\nprofessionals or securityholders. If you receive any inquiries from the general public, media, market\nprofessionals, or securityholders concerning the Company or its business, you should not respond to such\ninquires other than to refer the person making the inquiry to the Chief Marketing Officer, or other equivalent\npositions, or an Authorized Public Spokesperson. If you have the occasion to speak publicly on matters\nunrelated to the Company or its business, you may not give the appearance of speaking or acting on behalf\nof the Company.\n6\n• You must not disclose material non-public information to anyone outside of the Company unless such\ndisclosure is (i) approved by management and (ii) pursuant to a confidentiality or other arrangement approved\nby the Legal Department.\n• You must not disclose any proprietary or confidential information to anyone outside the Company except in\nthe ordinary course of business as required in the performance of your Company duties and as otherwise\npermitted under this Code of Conduct.\n• You must not post any messages, even on an anonymous basis, concerning the Company or otherwise\ncontaining Company information (financial or non-financial) to financial discussion boards or forums (for\nexample, Google Finance or Yahoo! Finance).\nThe Company’s policies regarding public communications do not prohibit or restrict you from engaging in any activities\nprotected by the rules and regulations of the National Labor Relations Board or other applicable laws. In addition, the\nCompany’s policies regarding public communications do not prohibit or restrict any member of MicroStrategy’s Board\nof Directors from acting in a manner required to satisfy such member’s fiduciary duties to the Company.\nFor more information regarding MicroStrategy’s public communications policies, please reference the Public\nCommunications Policy, the Social Media Policy, and the Insider Trading Policy sections of the MicroStrategy\nEmployee Handbook.\nPolitical Activities\nExcept to the extent permitted by the Company’s Political Contribution and Expenditure Policy, the Company prohibits\nthe use of MicroStrategy funds, assets, services, or facilities on behalf of any political party or candidate. Additionally,\nMicroStrategy may not reimburse or otherwise compensate you for political contributions.\nThis policy is not intended to discourage employees from voluntarily making personal political contributions,\nparticipating in the political process on their own time and at their own expense, expressing their personal views on\nlegislative or political matters, or otherwise engaging in any other lawful political activities.\nFor more information regarding MicroStrategy’s political contribution and expenditure policies, please reference the\nPolitical Contribution and Expenditure Policy section of the MicroStrategy Employee Handbook.\nFair Competition\nMicroStrategy sells products and services on their merit. False or misleading statements and innuendoes about\ncompetitors are never appropriate. It is appropriate to stress the advantages of MicroStrategy’s products and services\nand be sure that all comparisons are accurate.\nAntitrust (Competition)\nIt is MicroStrategy’s policy to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations affecting competition (antitrust\nlaws). When conducting business, the Company and you are governed by various laws affecting competition. Under\nthese laws, companies may not enter into agreements with other companies, either formally or informally, that interfere\nunlawfully with free and open competition in the marketplace, such as agreeing to charge the same price for products,\nagreeing not to compete, or agreeing to control production.\nSome additional types of agreements, such as exclusive dealing arrangements (i.e., a company agrees with a supplier\nthat it will not distribute a product that competes with the product it is buying from the supplier), may be prohibited under\ncertain circumstances. Therefore, any contracts and arrangements between the Company and other entities that\ncontain terms that may raise antitrust concerns should be reviewed by MicroStrategy’s Legal Department.\nIf you have any questions about the application or interpretation of antitrust laws, you should contact the Legal\nDepartment immediately.\n7\nCharitable Contributions\nFor purposes of this section and the sections of this Code of Conduct below entitled “Gifts” and “Anti-Bribery Laws,”\nthe following definitions shall apply:\n• “Representative” means any director, officer, employee, official, agent, or any other individual who is acting\non behalf of a Third Party Organization;

For example, U.S. laws prohibit bribery of “U.S. Government Officials,” which for purposes of this section of\nthe Code of Conduct are: (i) Representatives of any U.S. federal or state or local governmental department, agency,\nor instrumentality, (ii) Representatives of any entity or company owned or controlled by any U.S. federal or state or\nlocal governmental department, agency, or instrumentality, or (iii) any person acting in an official capacity for or on\nbehalf of any of the foregoing. Similarly, the U.K. Bribery Act prohibits bribery of U.K. government officials. Laws in\nother countries similarly prohibit public sector bribery in those countries. These laws generally provide for civil and\ncriminal sanctions for those who fail to comply. Companies which fail to comply with these laws may also be subject\nto debarment from government contracting.\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) prohibits bribery of Foreign (non-U.S.) Government\nOfficials and provides very serious civil and criminal sanctions for companies and individuals who fail to comply with\nthis statute. For purposes of this section of the Code of Conduct, a “Foreign Government Official” includes any of the\nfollowing (with respect to non-U.S. governments), regardless of rank: (i) an officer or employee of a government or a\ngovernmental department, agency, or instrumentality (including someone who holds a legislative, administrative, or\njudicial position of any kind, whether appointed or elected); (ii) a political party, a party official, or candidate for political\noffice; (iii) an officer or employee of a government owned or controlled entity or company; (iv) a member of a military;\n(v) an officer or employee of a public international organization (such as the United Nations or the World Bank); or (vi)\nany person acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of any of the foregoing or otherwise exercising a public function.\nSimilarly, the U.K. Bribery Act prohibits the giving and taking of bribes in the public sector generally, and bribery of non-\nU.K. public officials is a specific offense under the Act. Many countries in which MicroStrategy operates have similar\nlaws. These laws generally define the term “bribe” broadly to include Anything of Value offered or given with the\npurpose of influencing improperly or rewarding improperly a decision or conduct.\nTo help ensure compliance with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other public sector anti-bribery laws, you are\nprohibited from, directly or indirectly, offering, giving, paying, promising to give or pay (or entering into an agreement to\ndo any of the foregoing) Anything of Value to:\n• any Foreign or U.S. Government Official;\n• any relative of a Foreign or U.S. Government Official;\n• any other person or entity while knowing or having reason to know that the benefit will be given to a Foreign or\nU.S. Government Official; or\n• any entity owned or controlled by a Foreign or U.S. Government Official or a relative of a Foreign or U.S.\nGovernment Official\nfor the purpose of (i) influencing, inducing, rewarding, or otherwise affecting an official act, decision, or omission thereof,\n(ii) securing any improper business advantage, or (iii) assisting in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing\nbusiness to, any person or entity. As indicated above, Anything of Value includes, without limitation, payment for meals,\ntravel, or entertainment.\nCommercial bribery (bribery of Representatives of non-governmental entities), including kickbacks, is also illegal in the\nU.S. and various other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. For example, in the U.S., a number of state laws\nprohibit commercial bribery. Similarly, the U.K. Bribery Act prohibits the giving and taking of bribes in the private sector.\nYou must never directly or indirectly (i.e., through a third party) offer, give, pay, promise to give or pay (or enter into an\nagreement to do any of the foregoing) a bribe to any person or entity doing or seeking to do business with the Company.\nYou must also never directly or indirectly request, agree to accept, or accept a bribe from any person or entity doing or\nseeking to do business with the Company.\nFor more information regarding MicroStrategy’s policies on anti-bribery laws, please reference the Anti-Bribery Laws\nCompliance Policy section of the MicroStrategy Employee Handbook.\n10\nInternational Business\nBecause MicroStrategy conducts business internationally, as well as in the U.S., it is subject to the laws and regulations\ngoverning the conduct of U.S. business outside the U.S. and the export and import of goods to and from the U.S. These\nlaws include the following U.S. laws:\n• Export control laws, including the Export Administration Regulations;\n• The Trading With the Enemy Act, embargoes, and economic sanctions;\n• Various U.S. supported trading sanctions; and\n• Country-of-origin certification requirements.\nMicroStrategy Incorporated’s direct and indirect subsidiaries are also subject to the laws and regulations of the U.S.\nand foreign jurisdictions in which they operate.\nMicroStrategy’s policy is to comply with these and all other applicable laws and regulations, both in its U.S. operations\nand in those of its international affiliates.\nThe laws and regulations in these areas are complex, and violations can result in severe criminal and civil penalties for\nthe Company and for individuals. Accordingly, if you are faced with an international business law issue, you should\ncontact the Legal Department immediately.\nImplementing This Code of Conduct\nIn general, if you have a question or concern about any matter discussed in this Code of Conduct, you should contact\nHuman Resources or the Legal Department.\nCertificate of Compliance\nAt least annually, at the request of the Company, you shall be required to sign a certificate of compliance with the Code\nof Conduct in the form provided by the Company.\nReporting and Investigation of Violations\nIf you know or suspect that a violation of law, regulation, this Code of Conduct, or other material Company policy has\ntaken place or is about to take place, you are required to report promptly the known or suspected violation, regardless\nof who the offender may be. Unless otherwise indicated in this Code of Conduct or the Employee Handbook, Human\nResources, the Legal Department, and the MicroStrategy EthicsLine represent the only officially recognized means of\nreporting a known or suspected violation to help ensure that such violation will be registered and considered by the\nCompany.\nThe MicroStrategy EthicsLine operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and is run by an independent, third-party\nprovider to help preserve confidentiality and anonymity.

You are encouraged to report any\ncomplaints or concerns you may have regarding accounting, financial reporting, bribery, fraud, harassment, internal\ncontrols, auditing matters, or working conditions.\nThe Company will seek to maintain the confidentiality or anonymity of anyone reporting suspected violations, except\nas may be required by law or otherwise as needed to investigate or resolve the matter. The Company will seek to\ninvestigate any allegations diligently and will take corrective action as warranted. You are expected to cooperate with\nthe Company in the investigation of any alleged violation of laws or regulations, the Code of Conduct, or the Company’s\n11\nother policies. The Company prohibits retaliation against or intimidation of anyone who, in good faith, reports a\nsuspected violation or who participates in an investigation.\nCompliance is your responsibility. Failure to report a suspected violation of law or material Company policy is\nunacceptable and constitutes a violation of this Code of Conduct in itself.\nThe Company, at its discretion, will take appropriate disciplinary actions for violations of the Code of Conduct; such\ndisciplinary actions may include termination of your relationship with the Company, reduction of your compensation, or\nother action as MicroStrategy may deem appropriate. Failure to comply with the standards contained in the Code of\nConduct may also result in referral of individual misconduct for criminal prosecution and reimbursement to the\nCompany, the government, or other parties for any losses or damages resulting from the violation.\nInterpretation of Code of Conduct and Other Policies\nThis Code of Conduct is intended to affirm, summarize, and supplement existing policies of the Company found in the\nMicroStrategy Employee Handbook. Interpretation of any provisions of this Code of Conduct and other policies of the\nCompany is at the sole discretion of MicroStrategy.\n12\nMicroStrategy\nCERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE WITH CODE OF CONDUCT\nName: __________________ Date: ________________________\nBy clicking on the \"I Acknowledge\" button below, I certify that:\n• I received a copy of, or have convenient access to, the Code of Conduct;\n• I have read and I understand the Code of Conduct;\n• I acknowledge that, in accordance with the Code of Conduct and to the extent permissible under applicable\nlaw, I have no expectation of privacy in any email or other electronic message or content I create, store, send,\naccess, or receive on the Company’s system, and expressly waive any right to privacy in such messages or\ncontent;\n• I understand that the provisions contained in the Code of Conduct: (i) represent policies of MicroStrategy\nIncorporated and its subsidiaries and (ii) are applicable to me;\n• I am aware of my continuing obligation to bring to the attention of the appropriate personnel (as described in\nthe Code of Conduct) any suspected violations of law or of the Code of Conduct; and\n• I have at all times complied with, and will continue to comply with, the Code of Conduct.\n13"
