(NASDAQ: SHIM), a leading water infrastructure company, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 27, 2024.\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights_**\n\n  * Settlement in the Company’s Golden Gate Bridge (\"GGB\") Project which will result in $97 million of cash collected before the end of 2024 and is the last major outstanding legal claim related to its Legacy Projects.\n  * Announced the hiring of Ural Yal as Chief Executive Officer to replace Steve Richards who is retiring after a 43-year career.\n  * Reported revenue of $166 million, which includes $101 million of Shimmick Project revenue.\n  * Reported Shimmick Project gross margin of 6% for the quarter, the highest gross margin reported year-to-date.\n  * Recognized a net loss of $2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $30 million.\n  * Backlog is over $834 million as of September 27, 2024, with over 85% being Shimmick Projects.\n  * Continued to execute on Transformation Plan.\n\n\n\n**_Golden Gate Bridge Project Settlement:_**\n\n  * As previously announced, the settlement between a consolidating joint venture of the Company, Shimmick/Danny’s Joint Venture (\"SDJV\") and the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District (the “District”) was entered into on October 31, 2024. \n  * Under the terms of the settlement, SDJV will receive total settlement proceeds of $97 million, a contract change order for reduced scope of work of $6 million and a contract change order for extension of project completion and costs incurred on the GGB Project.\n  * The District is required to pay SDJV $97 million before the end of 2024.\n  * After paying subcontractor pass-through claims, Shimmick plans to use the remaining proceeds for ongoing operations, including completion of the GGB Project.\n  * Shimmick is expected to reach substantial completion of its onsite portions of the project in the third quarter of 2025 with remaining work after that related to a subcontractor’s offsite equipment fabrication activities.\n\n\n\n**_Transformation Plan Update_**\n\nThe Company continues to advance its strategic transformation toward a more capital-efficient business model with optimized operating costs. In addition to the GGB Project Settlement, key progress includes:\n\n  * Hired Ural Yal to replace Steve Richards, who will be retiring after a 43-year career. Ural has extensive knowledge of both the California and the water and critical infrastructure market. Ural will be starting with Shimmick December 2, 2024. \n  * Completion of the previously announced sale-leaseback of the Company’s equipment yard in Tracy, California, which resulted in a $17 million gain in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. \n  * A strategic decision to enhance the Company’s current enterprise resource planning (ERP) system rather than implementing a new platform which, due to prior investments and remaining contractual obligations, which resulted in a one-time charge of $16 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The Company expects this system upgrade to result in reduced overhead in future periods. \n\n\n\nAdditional transformation initiatives are progressing as planned. The Company plans to provide further updates in future communications.\n\n“We believe the GGB Project settlement is a major step forward in our progress to a more capital light focused business focused on capturing the growth opportunity in the California water and critical infrastructure market,” said Steve Richards, Chief Executive Officer of Shimmick.\n\n\"We don’t expect the election to have a material impact as infrastructure typically has bipartisan support and the recently passed $10 billion water-focused California Proposition 4 should provide additional market support,\" Mr. Richards continued.\n\n**_Financial Results_**\n\nA summary of our results is included in the table below:\n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n** _(In millions, except per share data)_**| **September 27, 2024**| **September 29, 2023**| **September 27, 2024**| **September 29, 2023**  \nRevenue| $| 166| $| 175| $| 377| $| 495  \nGross margin| 12| $| 17| (35| )| 23  \nNet (loss) income attributable to Shimmick Corporation| (2| )| 35| (86| )| 15  \nAdjusted net income (loss)| 24| 37| (50| )| 25  \nAdjusted EBITDA| 30| 42| (34| )| 39  \nDiluted (loss) income per common share attributable to Shimmick Corporation| $| (0.05| )| $| 1.58| $| (2.96| )| $| 0.68  \nAdjusted diluted income (loss) per common share attributable to Shimmick Corporation| $| 0.72| $| 1.67| $| (1.72| )| $| 1.12  \n  \nThe following table presents revenue and gross margin data for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023:\n\n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n** _(In millions, except percentage data)_**| **September 27, 2024**| **September 29, 2023**| **September 27, 2024**| **September 29, 2023**  \n**Shimmick Projects(1)**  \nRevenue| $| 101| $| 110| $| 275| $| 301  \nGross Margin| 6| 15| 10| 29  \nGross Margin (%)| 6| %| 14| %| 4| %| 9| %  \n**Foundations Projects(2)**  \nRevenue| $| 11| $| 12| $| 26| $| 41  \nGross Margin| (2| )| (1| )| (8| )| (7| )  \nGross Margin (%)| (18| )%| (12| )%| (32| )%| (17| )%  \n**Legacy Projects(3)**  \nRevenue| $| 54| $| 54| $| 75| $| 153  \nGross Margin| 8| 3| (37| )| 1  \nGross Margin (%)| 15| %| 6| %| (49| )%| 1| %  \n**Consolidated Total**  \nRevenue| $| 166| $| 175| $| 377| $| 495  \nGross Margin| 12| 17| (35| )| 23  \nGross Margin (%)| 7| %| 10| %| (9| )%| 5| %  \n(1) Shimmick Projects are those projects started after the AECOM Sale Transactions that have focused on water infrastructure and other critical infrastructure.  \n(2) The Company entered into an agreement to sell the assets of non-core foundation projects in the second quarter of 2024 and is winding down any remaining work during the year. As the revenue will decline during the remainder of the 2024 fiscal year, the Company is reporting revenue and gross margin related to the projects separately for the periods presented (\"Foundations Projects\").  \n(3) Legacy Projects are those projects assumed as part of the AECOM Sale Transactions, that were started under AECOM ownership. _Shimmick Projects_  \n  \nProjects started after the AECOM Sale Transactions (\"Shimmick Projects\") have focused on water infrastructure and other critical infrastructure. Revenue recognized on Shimmick Projects was $101 million and $110 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The $9 million decrease in revenue was primarily the result of a $28 million decrease from lower activity on existing jobs and jobs winding down partially offset by $19 million of revenue from a new water infrastructure job. \n\nGross margin recognized on Shimmick Projects was $6 million and $15 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The decline in the gross margin was primarily the result of a $12 million decrease in gross margin on existing jobs that are winding down and completing partially offset by a $3 million increase in margin from a new water infrastructure job.\n\n_Foundations Projects_\n\nThe Company entered into an agreement to sell the assets of our non-core Foundations Projects in the second quarter of 2024 and will be winding down any remaining work during the remainder of the 2024 fiscal year. As a result, revenue from Foundations Projects will decline during the remainder of the 2024 fiscal year. Revenue recognized on Foundations Projects was $11 million and $12 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The decline in revenue was the result of timing of jobs winding down. \n\nGross margin recognized on Foundations Projects was $(2) million and $(1) million for the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The decline in gross margin was the result of cost overruns and jobs winding down.\n\n_Legacy Projects_\n\nAs part of the AECOM Sale Transactions, we assumed the Legacy Projects and backlog that were started under AECOM. Legacy Projects revenue was flat at $54 million for each of the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023. Included in the quarter is a $31 million adjustment to revenue to reflect the GGB Project settlement amount. Without the adjustment, Legacy Project revenue would have declined by $31 million reflecting the continued wind down of the Legacy Projects.\n\nGross margin was $8 million and $3 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The increase in gross margin was primarily as a result of the GGB Project settlement which was partially offset by continued impacts of Legacy Projects winding down, as well as additional legal fees to pursue contract modifications and recoveries and additional cost overruns on other Legacy Loss Projects (as defined below).\n\nA subset of Legacy Projects (\"Legacy Loss Projects\") have experienced significant cost overruns due to the COVID pandemic, design issues, legal costs and other factors. In the Legacy Loss Projects, we have recognized the estimated costs to complete and the loss expected from these projects. If the estimates of costs to complete fixed-price contracts indicate a further loss, the entire amount of the additional loss expected over the life of the project is recognized as a period cost in the cost of revenue. As these Legacy Loss Projects continue to wind down to completion, no further gross margin will be recognized and in some cases, there may be additional costs associated with these projects. Revenue recognized on these Legacy Loss Projects was $49 million and $27 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily as a result of the GGB Project settlement discussed above, partially offset by continued impacts of other Legacy Loss Projects winding down. Gross margin recognized on these Legacy Loss Projects was $10 million and $(1) million for the three months ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, respectively, the increase of which is primarily as a result of the GGB Project settlement.\n\n_Selling, general and administrative expenses_\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses remained approximately flat period over period.\n\n_Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures_\n\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was $1 million, compared to earnings of $3 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by increased costs due to schedule extensions experienced during the nine months ended September 27, 2024.\n\n_Gain on sale of assets_\n\nGain on sale of assets decreased by $13 million primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of non-core business contracts for $30 million during the three months ended September 29, 2023 that did not reoccur during the nine months ended September 27, 2024, partially offset by the $17 million gain recognized on the transaction for the sale-leaseback of our equipment yard in Tracy, California during the three months ended September 27, 2024.\n\n_ERP pre-implementation asset impairment and associated costs_\n\nERP pre-implementation asset impairment and associated costs increased by $16 million due to the strategic decision to enhance the Company’s current ERP system rather than implementing a new platform which, due to prior capitalized costs and remaining contractual obligations, resulted in a one-time charge of $16 million recorded in the three months ended September 27, 2024.\n\n_Interest expense_\n\nInterest expense increased by $2 million primarily due to interest charges on the Credit Facility which was not entered into until May 20, 2024.\n\n_Other expense, net_\n\nOther expense, net remained approximately flat period over period.\n\n_Income tax expense_\n\nIncome tax expense was flat period over period. Due to an expected tax loss for fiscal year ending 2024, no taxable income or tax expense is anticipated for 2024, and no taxable income was recorded for the prior year three months ended September 29, 2023.\n\n_Net (loss) income_\n\nNet (loss) income decreased by $36 million to a net loss of $2 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024, primarily due to an increase in ERP pre-implementation asset impairment and associated costs of $16 million, a decrease in gain on the sale of assets of $13 million, decrease in gross margin of $5 million, increase of interest expense of $2 million and decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures of $2 million all as described above.\n\nDiluted loss per common share was $(0.05) for the three months ended September 27, 2024, compared to diluted income per common share of $1.58 for the same period in 2023.\n\nAdjusted net income was $24 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024, compared to an adjusted net income of $37 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nAdjusted diluted income per common share was $0.72 for the three months ended September 27, 2024, compared to $1.67 for the same period in 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $30 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024, compared to $42 million for the same period in 2023.\n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Guidance**\n\nFor the full 2024 fiscal year, we now expect:\n\n  * After excluding Foundations Projects revenue of $64 million for the fiscal year ending December 29, 2023, Shimmick Projects revenue to remain generally flat with gross margin between 4 to 7 percent\n  * Legacy Projects revenue of $90 to $95 million with negative gross margin of (40%) to (50%), due to the Legacy Loss Project settlement, additional costs recorded for a Legacy Loss Project related to pending change orders and other cost overruns \n\n\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nShimmick will host an investor conference call Tuesday, November 12, at 8:30 am EST.

(NASDAQ: SHIM), a leading water infrastructure company, today announced that it has appointed Ural Yal as its new CEO and member of the Board of Directors effective December 2, 2024. Mr. Yal succeeds Steve Richards as he retires following a distinguished 43-year career.\n\nMr. Yal, 47, brings over 26 years of experience in water and critical infrastructure construction. Since joining in 2017, he served in various senior roles at Flatiron Construction, where he led teams and business units that won and executed large and complex water and heavy civil infrastructure projects. Most recently as an Executive Vice President, he oversaw the company’s growth into new markets and expansion into projects delivered through risk balanced, collaborative project delivery methods. Earlier in his career he served in progressive operating and leadership roles from Field Engineer to Area Manager, gaining a strong understanding of the industry from the ground up, with a focus in the California market. Throughout his career, Mr. Yal has adopted a client focused approach to engineering and construction while achieving successful financial outcomes and consistent and sustainable growth. Mr. Yal has an undergraduate degree in Civil engineering from Istanbul Technical University and an MBA from California State University, Dominguez Hills. He is also a California licensed civil engineer.\n\n“Ural’s deep expertise in both the California market and national infrastructure construction along with a proven track record of operational growth make him the ideal leader for Shimmick’s next chapter,” said Shimmick’s Executive Chairman Mitch Goldsteen. “With our recent major claim settlements and streamlined business strategy, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on market opportunities under his leadership.”\n\n“I am honored to join Shimmick and its team of dedicated professionals,” said Mr. Yal. “Shimmick has been known for undertaking and delivering challenging projects for decades. This reputation provides a strong foundation as we focus on growth through operational excellence, safety leadership, and client satisfaction.”\n\nSteve Richards has served as Shimmick’s CEO since 2021, culminating a career-long tenure with the Company and its predecessors. Under his leadership, Shimmick successfully completed its transition to a standalone public company through its IPO and established a strong market position. Following his retirement, Mr. Richards will transition to a strategic advisor role to assist with the leadership transition and he will remain a member of the Board of Directors until the 2025 annual meeting. \n\n“On behalf of the entire Board of Directors, I want to extend our gratitude to Steve for his strong leadership and critical contributions to Shimmick over the course of his career,” said Mr. Goldsteen. “His steadfast leadership through our IPO and strategic repositioning has created a solid platform for future success. We are grateful for his continued guidance during this transition period and wish him the very best in his well-deserved retirement.”\n\n“With our recent legacy project settlements, I believe this is the optimal time for the Company’s leadership transition,” said Mr. Richards. “Throughout my 43-year career, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside exceptional colleagues who consistently delivered quality work with an outstanding safety record. I believe Ural’s proven leadership capabilities make him exceptionally well-qualified to guide Shimmick through its next growth phase.”\n\n**About Shimmick Corporation**\n\nShimmick Corporation (\"Shimmick\", the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: SHIM) is a leading provider of water and critical infrastructure solutions throughout California and nationwide.
