This launch represents a pivotal moment in our growth strategy, reflecting our commitment to innovation and consumer trust. These efforts have also been supported by a strong third quarter, with 59.4% year-over-year revenue growth and 30.9% growth from the second quarter. Improved gross margins further highlight our focus on operational excellence and cost optimization, even as we invest in structuring the Company for IM8’s success—including the strategic acquisition of Europa to support our US expansion.”\n\nMr. Yeung continued, “With Tencent’s $30 million investment to purchase secondary shares, Insighta’s valuation of $200 million has been validated, further strengthening our financial position. This strategic collaboration will enhance our early cancer detection and diagnostic capabilities by leveraging AI and positions us for future growth. As we approach the close of 2024, we are energized by the growth opportunities arising from our strategic pivot to the US market and are confident in surpassing our FY 2024 revenue target of $33 million. IM8 is not just another launch—it’s the start of a transformative journey in consumer health, built on science, innovation, and trust, and we remain committed to driving additional value for our shareholders.”\n\n**About Prenetics** Prenetics (NASDAQ:PRE), a leading health sciences company, is dedicated to advancing consumer and clinical health.

Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the Company’s goals, targets, projections, outlooks, beliefs, expectations, strategy, plans, objectives of management for future operations of the Company, and growth opportunities are forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by words or phrases such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “target,” “aim,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “potential,” “continue,” “is/are likely to” or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and forecasts and reflect the views, assumptions, expectations, and opinions of the Company, which involve inherent risks and uncertainties, therefore they should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to: the Company’s ability to further develop and grow its business, including new products and services; its ability to execute on its new business strategy in genomics, precision oncology, and specifically, early detection for cancer; the results of case control studies and/or clinical trials; and its ability to identify and execute on M&A opportunities, especially in precision oncology. In addition to the foregoing factors, you should also carefully consider the other risks and uncertainties described in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s most recent registration statement and the prospectus therein, and the other documents filed by the Company from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

An explanation of this measure is also included below under the heading “Non-IFRS Financial Measure”.\n\n**Non-IFRS Financial Measure** To supplement Prenetics’ consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), the Company is providing non-IFRS measure, adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations. This non-IFRS financial measure is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by IFRS and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies. Management believes this non-IFRS financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results and trends.\n\nManagement is excluding from some or all of its non-IFRS results (1) Employee equity-settled share-based payment expenses, (2) depreciation and amortization, (3) Amortization of deferred expenses, (4) Acquisition and transaction-related costs, (5) Strategic realignment and discontinued products impact, and (6) finance income and exchange gain or loss, net — items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook, including but not limited to non-cash and/or non-recurring items. These non-IFRS financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact on the reported financial results. Management accounts for this limitation by analyzing results on an IFRS basis as well as a non-IFRS basis and also by providing IFRS measures in the Company’s public disclosures.\n\nIn addition, other companies, including companies in the same industry, may not use the same non-IFRS measures or may calculate these metrics in a different manner than management or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of these non-IFRS measures as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, the Company’s non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS. Investors are encouraged to review the non-IFRS reconciliations provided in the tables captioned “Reconciliation of loss from operations from continuing operations under IFRS and adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations (Non-IFRS)” set forth at the end of this document.\n\n**PRENETICS GLOBAL LIMITED****Unaudited consolidated statements of financial position** _(Expressed in United States

His career spanned 20 years with some of the most successful clubs in the world: Manchester United, Real Madrid, AC Milan, LA Galaxy, Paris Saint-Germain and the England team, which he captained for six years.\n\nSince retiring from football in 2013, Beckham has worked with world-leading brands including Adidas, Tudor, Hugo Boss, Stella Artois and Sands. In 2018, he became a founder and co-owner of Major League Soccer club Inter Miami CF, the culmination of his lifelong ambition to own a football club and the start of an exciting new chapter.\n\nIn 2019, David founded the content studio, Studio 99. The studio operates both editorial and commercial production, and specialises in developing and producing premium documentary features, series and formats for global platforms and networks, including Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video. Studio 99’s recent work has included the Emmy award-winning documentary series “BECKHAM” (Netflix) and the compelling documentaries “99”, about Manchester United's extraordinary treble-winning season, and “Ronnie O'Sullivan: The Edge of Everything” (both for Amazon Prime Video). The studio also produces commercial content for globally recognised brands such as Nespresso, EA Sports, Tudor and Maserati.\n\nIn February 2022, Authentic Brands Group (ABG), the world’s largest sports and entertainment licensing company, announced a strategic partnership with David Beckham to co-own and manage Beckham’s global brand. In connection with the partnership, David Beckham became a shareholder in ABG and joined a roster of ABG’s growing entertainment portfolio that includes some of the world’s most celebrated athletes and iconic sports brands, such as Muhammad Ali, Shaquille O’Neal, and Sports Illustrated.\n\nThroughout his life, Beckham has been committed to supporting charities and projects that seek to drive change for the better. In 2024, he was appointed Ambassador for The King’s Foundation, which looks to nature and tradition to build thriving, sustainable communities and transform lives by offering education programmes that protect traditional skills and knowledge for future generations. He has worked with UNICEF for nearly 20 years as a Goodwill Ambassador, a role that promotes and protects the rights of the world’s most vulnerable children. In 2015, David launched the 7 Fund with UNICEF—a unique partnership to give vulnerable and disadvantaged children the opportunity to reach their full potential. He also campaigns for Malaria No More, using his platform to ensure the world and its leaders hear the urgent message of the malaria fight. Additionally, in his position as Ambassadorial President of the British Fashion Council (BFC), David helps promote and nurture British fashion and the UK’s creative industries.\n\n***This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

This investment values Insighta at US$200 million and underscores Tencent’s endeavor to advancing AI-powered innovations in healthcare.\n\nFollowing the transaction, Prenetics’ stake in Insighta will be reduced from 50% to 35%. Insighta’s co-founders will retain their 50% shareholding. As part of the agreement, Prenetics has received US$30 million in cash from the sale of secondary shares to Tencent, boosting its pro forma cash and other current short-term assets1 to over US$90 million at closing of the transaction. Tencent will also gain a seat on Insighta’s Board of Directors, to be held by Alexander Ng, President of Tencent Healthcare.\n\nInsighta’s early cancer detection platform is powered by its proprietary FRAGMA technology, a cutting-edge system designed to detect DNA methylation aberrations in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in bodily fluids such as blood. By identifying specific fragment patterns associated with cancer cells, FRAGMA enables non-invasive, highly accurate early epigenetics-based detection of multiple cancers. Epigenetics is the study of biochemical modifications of the genome without changes in DNA sequences. This ingenious approach in detecting fragmented DNA signatures allows the cost-effective detection of cancer, making FRAGMA a crucial innovation in cancer detection.\n\nInsighta has commenced clinical trials in Mainland China, focusing initially on liver cancer, and will soon expand to include lung cancer detection. Insighta is also actively developing tests for additional cancer types, and plans on updating as appropriate.\n\nWith US$80 million in cash reserves, Insighta is well-capitalized to fund these trials and expedite the commercialization of its revolutionary cancer detection technology in the next few years.\n\n“We are excited to welcome Tencent as a strategic investor,” said Professor Allen Chan, co-founder of Insighta. “Their expertise in AI, combined with our proprietary FRAGMA technology, positions us to make significant strides in improving early cancer diagnosis, which can greatly enhance patient outcomes worldwide.”\n\nTencent’s robust AI resources and healthcare expertise are expected to propel Insighta’s technological advancements even further. This is conducive to facilitating the widespread application of FRAGMA technology in early screening for multiple types of cancer, thereby improving prevention strategies for cancer.\n\n“Tencent sees tremendous potential in Insighta’s FRAGMA-powered approach to early cancer detection,” said Alexander Ng, President of Tencent Healthcare. “We look forward to deepening our partnership with Insighta through various dimensions, including technical collaboration and financial investment. In the future, leveraging Tencent’s leading AI technology and service platform, we will strive to improve the accuracy of early cancer detection using FRAGMA technology, reduce service costs, and further enhance accessibility. Together, we believe we can make significant progress in improving the accuracy of early cancer diagnosis and ultimately save lives.”\n\nDanny Yeung, CEO of Prenetics, commented on the transaction: “This investment marks another significant step for Insighta as it continues its mission to transform cancer detection. With Tencent now on board, Insighta is well-positioned to accelerate clinical development and commercialization efforts. Prenetics remains committed to Insighta’s long-term success and will continue to support its groundbreaking work.”\n\n**ABOUT PRENETICS** Prenetics (NASDAQ:PRE), a leading health sciences company, is dedicated to advancing consumer and clinical health.

These statements are made under the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the Company’s goals, targets, projections, outlooks, beliefs, expectations, strategy, plans, objectives of management for future operations of the Company, and growth opportunities are forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by words or phrases such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “target,” “aim,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “potential,” “continue,” “is/are likely to” or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and forecasts and reflect the views, assumptions, expectations, and opinions of the Company, which involve inherent risks and uncertainties, therefore they should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to: the Company’s ability to further develop and grow its business, including new products and services; its ability to execute on its new business strategy in genomics, precision oncology, and specifically, early detection for cancer; the results of case control studies and/or clinical trials; and its ability to identify and execute on M&A opportunities, especially in precision oncology. In addition to the foregoing factors, you should also carefully consider the other risks and uncertainties described in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s most recent registration statement and the prospectus therein, and the other documents filed by the Company from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. All information provided in this press release is as of the date of this press release, and the Company does not undertake any duty to update such information, except as required under applicable law.\n\n**Investor Relations Contact:** investors@prenetics.comPRE@mzgroup.us\n\nAngela CheungInvestor Relations / Corporate FinancePrenetics Global Limitedangela.hm.cheung@prenetics.com\n\n**Basis of Presentation** Unaudited Non-IFRS Financial Measures has been provided in the financial statements tables included at the end of this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Unaudited Non-IFRS Financial Measures”.\n\n**Unaudited Non-IFRS Financial Measures** To supplement Prenetics’ consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), the Company is providing non-IFRS measures, adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations. These non-IFRS financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by IFRS and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies. Management believes these non-IFRS financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results and trends.\n\nManagement is excluding from some or all of its non-IFRS results (1) Employee equity-settled share-based payment expenses, (2) depreciation and amortization, (3) Amortization of deferred expenses, (4) Acquisition and transaction-related costs, (5) Strategic realignment and discontinued products impact, and (6) finance income and exchange gain or loss, net — items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook, including but not limited to non-cash and/ or non-recurring items. These non-IFRS financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact on the reported financial results. Management accounts for this limitation by analyzing results on an IFRS basis as well as a non-IFRS basis and also by providing IFRS measures in the Company’s public disclosures.\n\nIn addition, other companies, including companies in the same industry, may not use the same non-IFRS measures or may calculate these metrics in a different manner than management or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of these non-IFRS measures as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, the Company’s non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS. Investors are encouraged to review the non-IFRS reconciliations provided in the tables captioned “Reconciliation of loss from operations from continuing operations under IFRS and adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations (Non-IFRS)” set forth at the end of this document.\n\n**PRENETICS GLOBAL LIMITED****Unaudited consolidated statements of financial position** _(Expressed in United States
