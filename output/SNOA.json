AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n(Rounded to nearest thousand unless specified)\n\n(Unaudited)\n\n**Note 1.** | **Organization and Recent Developments**  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Organization_**\n\nSonoma Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of California in April 1999 and was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in December 2006. The Company moved its principal office from Petaluma, California to Woodstock, Georgia in June 2020 and to Boulder, Colorado in October 2022. The Company is a global healthcare leader for developing and producing stabilized hypochlorous acid (“HOCl”) products for a wide range of applications, including wound care, eye, oral and nasal care, dermatological conditions, podiatry, animal health care, and as a non-toxic disinfectant. The Company’s products are clinically proven to reduce itch, pain, scarring, and irritation safely and without damaging healthy tissue. In-vitro and clinical studies of HOCl show it to safely manage skin abrasions, lacerations, minor irritations, cuts, and intact skin. The Company sells its products either directly or via partners in 55 countries worldwide.\n\n**_Reverse Stock Split_**\n\nEffective August 29, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Every twenty shares of common stock were reclassified and combined into one share of common stock. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Instead, each fractional share was settled with cash. The reverse stock split reduced the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding from 21,174,693 to 1,058,447. The total number of authorized shares of common stock was not proportionally decreased and the par value per share of the common stock continues to be $0.0001. The reverse stock split has been retroactively applied to all share and per share amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes.\n\n**_Basis of Presentation_**\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial statements and are in the form prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024, and notes thereto included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on June 17, 2024.\n\n7  \n---  \n  \n**Note 2.** | **Liquidity and Financial Condition**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company reported a net loss of $610,000 and $1,484,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1,753,000 and $2,902,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company’s accumulated deficit amounted to $196,102,000 and $194,349,000, respectively. The Company had working capital of $8,912,000 and $8,829,000 as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The cash balance at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 was $4,078,000 and $3,128,000, respectively. During the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in operating activities amounted to $558,000 and $1,446,000, respectively.\n\nManagement believes that the Company has access to additional capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means; however, the Company cannot provide any assurance that other new financings will be available on commercially acceptable terms, if needed. If the economic climate in the U.S. deteriorates, the Company’s ability to raise additional capital could be negatively impacted. If the Company is unable to secure additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve its cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet its obligations. These measures could cause significant delays in the Company’s continued efforts to commercialize its products, which is critical to the realization of its business plan and the future operations of the Company. This uncertainty along with the Company’s history of losses indicates that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n\n**Note 3.** | **Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Use of Estimates_**\n\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the dates of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions include reserves and write-downs related to receivables and inventories, the valuation allowance relating to the Company’s deferred tax assets, valuation of equity and the estimated amortization periods of upfront product licensing fees received from customers. Periodically, the Company evaluates and adjusts estimates accordingly.\n\n**_Net Loss per Share_**\n\nThe Company computes basic net loss per share by dividing net loss per share available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period and excludes the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share, if presented, would include the dilution that would occur upon the exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities into common stock using the “treasury stock” and/or “if converted” methods as applicable.\n\nThe following table provides the net loss for each period along with the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share:\n\nSchedule of computation of basic and diluted net loss per share  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,** | **Six Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n(In thousands, except per share data) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNumerator:  \nNet loss | $| (610| ) | $| (1,484| ) | $| (1,753| ) | $| (2,902| )  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted-average number of common shares outstanding: basic and diluted | 1,034 | 258 | 943 | 253  \nNet loss per share: basic and diluted | $| (0.59| ) | $| (5.75| ) | $| (1.86| ) | $| (11.47| )  \n  \n8  \n---  \n  \nThe computation of basic loss per share for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 excludes the potentially dilutive securities summarized in the table below because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\n\nSchedule of anti-dilutive shares  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,** | **Six Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n(In thousands) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nStock options | 42 | 26 | 42 | 26  \nWarrants | – | 5 | – | 5  \nCommon stock units (1) | – | 2 | – | 2  \n42 | 33 | 42 | 33  \n(1) | Consists of 1,533 restricted stock units and warrants to purchase 766 shares of common stock.  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Revenue Recognition_**\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”). Revenue is recognized when the Company transfers promised goods or services to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations under the agreement, the Company performs the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that it will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\n\nThe Company derives the majority of its revenue through sales of its products directly to end users and to distributors. The Company also sells products to a customer base, including hospitals, medical centers, doctors, pharmacies, distributors and wholesalers. The Company has also entered into agreements to license its technology and products.\n\nThe Company considers customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements, to be the contracts with a customer. For each contract, the Company considers the promise to transfer products, each of which are distinct, to be the identified performance obligations. In determining the transaction price the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which it expects to be entitled.\n\nFor all of the Company’s sales to non-consignment distribution channels, revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e. when its performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs when title passes to the customer upon shipment but could occur when the customer receives the product based on the terms of the agreement with the customer. For product sales to its value-added resellers, non-stocking distributors and end-user customers, the Company grants return privileges to its customers, and because the Company has a long history with its customers, the Company is able to estimate the amount of product that will be returned.\n\nThe Company has entered into consignment arrangements, in which goods are left in the possession of another party to sell. As products are sold from the customer to third parties, the Company recognizes revenue based on a variable percentage of a fixed price. Revenue recognized varies depending on whether a patient is covered by insurance or is not covered by insurance. In addition, the Company may incur a revenue deduction related to the use of the Company’s rebate program.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \nSales to stocking distributors are made under terms with fixed pricing and limited rights of return (known as “stock rotation”) of the Company’s products held in their inventory. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon the transfer of control to the distributor.\n\nThe Company evaluates the creditworthiness of new customers and monitors the creditworthiness of its existing customers to determine whether an event or changes in their financial circumstances would raise doubt as to the collectability of a sale at the time in which a sale is made. Payment terms on sales are generally 30 to 90 days.\n\nThe Company assessed the promised goods and services in the technical support contract with Invekra for a ten-year period as being a distinct service that Invekra can benefit from on its own and as separately identifiable from any other promises within the contract. Given that the distinct service is not substantially the same as other goods and services within the Invekra contract, the Company accounted for the distinct service as a performance obligation.\n\n**_Accounts Receivable_**\n\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded net of allowances for cash discounts for prompt payment, doubtful accounts, and sales returns. Estimates for cash discounts and sales returns are based on analysis of contractual terms and historical trends.\n\nThe Company’s policy is to reserve for uncollectible accounts based on its best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company periodically reviews its accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other factors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Other factors that the Company considers include its existing contractual obligations, historical payment patterns of its customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region, and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company did not deem it necessary to record an allowance for doubtful accounts for probable credit losses at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. Additionally, at September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company has allowances of $66,000 and $27,000, respectively, related to potential discounts, returns, distributor fees and rebates. The allowances are included in Accounts Receivable, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\n**_Inventories_**\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost, cost being determined on a standard cost basis (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis), or net realizable value.\n\nDue to changing market conditions, estimated future requirements, age of the inventories on hand and production of new products, the Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value. At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company recorded provisions to reduce the carrying amounts of inventories to their net realizable value in the amounts of $254,000 and $296,000, respectively, which is included in Inventories, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n\n**_Recent Accounting Standards_**\n\nAccounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB, the SEC or other standard setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n**Note 4.** | **Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet**  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Inventories, net_**\n\nInventories, net consist of the following:\n\nSchedule of inventories, net  \n---  \nSeptember 30, | March 31,  \n2024 | 2024  \nRaw materials | $| 1,670,000 | $| 1,802,000  \nFinished goods | 1,421,000 | 1,213,000  \n**Inventories, gross** | 3,091,000 | 3,015,000  \nLess: allowance for obsolete and excess inventory | (254,000| ) | (296,000| )  \nTotal inventories, net | $| 2,837,000 | $| 2,719,000  \n  \n**_Leases_**\n\nThe Company’s operating leases are comprised primarily of facility leases.

While management believes that such matters are currently insignificant, matters arising in the ordinary course of business for which the Company is or could become involved in litigation may have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition of comprehensive loss.\n\n**_Employment Matters_**\n\nThe Company has employment agreements in place with two of its key executives. These executive employment agreements provide, among other things, for the payment of up to eighteen months of severance compensation for terminations under certain circumstances.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, with respect to these agreements, aggregated annual salaries was $586,000 and potential severance payments to these key executives is $1,300,000, if triggered.\n\n**Note 6.** | **Debt**  \n---|---  \n  \n_Financing of Insurance Premiums_\n\nOn February 6, 2024, the Company entered into a note agreement for $373,000 with an interest rate of 8.42% per annum with final payment on November 1, 2024. This instrument was issued in connection with financing insurance premiums. The note is payable in nine monthly installment payments of principal and interest of $42,000, with the first installment beginning March 1, 2024. At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the outstanding principal on the note amounted to $82,000 and $323,000, respectively.\n\n**Note 7.** | **Stockholders’ Equity**  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Authorized Capital_**\n\nEffective August 29, 2024, the Company increased its authorized shares from 24,000,000 to 50,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Additionally, the Company is authorized to issue 714,286 shares of convertible preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share.\n\n**_Sale of Common Stock_**\n\nIn connection with the Equity Distribution Agreement that the Company entered into on December 15, 2023 with Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim”), as amended, from May 13, 2024 to September 18, 2024 the Company sold 539,744 shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of $2,490,000 and net proceeds of $2,289,000 after deducting commissions and other offering expenses paid by the Company.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n**Note 8.** | **Stock-Based Compensation**  \n---|---  \n  \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred $14,000 and $130,000 of stock-based compensation expense, respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred $121,000 and $307,000 of stock-based compensation expense, respectively. All stock-based compensation incurred is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, there was unrecognized compensation costs of $229,000 related to stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average amortization period of 1.80 years.\n\nStock options award activity is as follows:\n\nSchedule of stock options award activity  \n---  \nNumber of Shares | Weighted- Average Exercise Price  \nOutstanding at April 1, 2024 | 51,675 | $| 62.60  \nOptions exercised | (9,250| ) | 3.60  \nOptions forfeited | (250| ) | 3.60  \nOptions expired | (10| ) | 2,402  \nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 | 42,165 | $| 75.77  \nExercisable at September 30, 2024 | 28,335 | $| 107.92  \n  \nThe aggregate intrinsic value of stock options is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying stock options and the fair value of the Company’s common stock, or $3.07 per share at September 30, 2024.\n\nRestricted stock award activity is as follows:\n\nSchedule of unvested restricted stock activity  \n---  \n**Number of** **Shares** | **Weighted** **Average Award** **Date Fair Value** **per Share**  \nUnvested restricted stock awards outstanding at April 1, 2024 | – | $| –  \nRestricted stock awards granted | 9,538 | 4.00  \nRestricted stock awards vested | (9,538| ) | 4.00  \nUnvested restricted stock awards outstanding at September 30, 2024 | – | $| –  \n  \nThe Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \n**Note 9.** | **Income Taxes**  \n---|---  \n  \nAt the end of each interim reporting period, the Company determines the income tax provision by using an estimate of the annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items occurring in the quarter.\n\nOur effective tax rate for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 was (31.5)% and (20.5)%, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to the valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets in the U.S., and permanent tax adjustment of intercompany interest expense in Mexico and Netherlands.\n\nJudgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdictional basis to estimate if deferred tax assets will be recognized and when it is more likely than not that all or some deferred tax assets will not be realized, and a valuation allowance must be established. As of September 30, 2024, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance in the U.S.\n\n**Note 10.** | **Revenue Disaggregation**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company generates product revenues from products which are sold into the human and animal healthcare markets, and the Company generates service revenues from laboratory testing services which are provided to medical device manufacturers.\n\nThe following table presents the Company’s disaggregated revenues by revenue source:\n\nSchedule of disaggregated revenue by source  \n---  \nThree Months Ended September 30, | Six Months Ended September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nHuman Care | $| 2,957,000 | $| 2,075,000 | $| 5,833,000 | $| 4,825,000  \nAnimal Care | 402,000 | 489,000 | 801,000 | 1,067,000  \nService and Royalty | 220,000 | 167,000 | 336,000 | 266,000  \n$| 3,579,000 | $| 2,731,000 | $| 6,970,000 | $| 6,158,000  \n  \nThe following table shows the Company’s revenues by geographic region:\n\nSchedule of revenues by geographic region  \n---  \nThree Months Ended September 30, | Six Months Ended September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nUnited States | $| 675,000 | $| 590,000 | $| 1,317,000 | $| 1,396,000  \nEurope | 1,506,000 | 1,201,000 | 2,794,000 | 2,271,000  \nAsia | 776,000 | 346,000 | 1,253,000 | 1,208,000  \nLatin America | 465,000 | 260,000 | 1,345,000 | 747,000  \nRest of the World | 157,000 | 334,000 | 261,000 | 536,000  \nTotal | $| 3,579,000 | $| 2,731,000 | $| 6,970,000 | $| 6,158,000  \n  \n14  \n---  \n  \n**Note 11.** | **Significant Customer Concentrations**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe following table shows major customers revenues as a percentage of net revenue:\n\nSchedule of customer concentrations of risk  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Six Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nCustomer A | –*% | 13% | –*% | 14%  \nCustomer B | 13% | 10% | 19% | 12%  \nCustomer C | 19% | 21% | 19% | 17%  \nCustomer D | 12% | –*% | –*% | –*%  \n  \nThe following table shows major customers accounts receivable balances as a percentage of net accounts receivables:\n\n**September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \nCustomer A | 16% | 11%  \nCustomer C | 11% | 13%  \nCustomer D | 20% | 20%  \n* | Represents less than 10%  \n---|---  \n**Note 12.** | **Subsequent Events**  \n---|---  \n  \nManagement has evaluated subsequent events or transactions occurring through the date the condensed consolidated financial statements were issued.

Our products are clinically proven to reduce itch, pain, scarring, and irritation safely and without damaging healthy tissue. In-vitro and clinical studies of HOCl show it to safely manage skin abrasions, lacerations, minor irritations, cuts, and intact skin. We sell our products either directly or via partners in 55 countries worldwide.\n\n16  \n---  \n  \n**Business Channels**\n\nOur core market differentiation is based on being the leading developer and producer of stabilized hypochlorous acid, or HOCl, solutions. We have been in business for over 20 years, and in that time, we have developed significant scientific knowledge of how best to develop and manufacture HOCl products backed by decades of studies and data collection. HOCl is known to be among the safest and most-effective ways to relieve itch, inflammation and burns while stimulating natural healing through increased oxygenation and eliminating persistent microorganisms and biofilms.\n\nWe sell our products into many markets both in the U.S. and internationally. In international markets, we ship a variety of products to 55 countries. Our core strategy is to work with partners both in the United States and around the world to market and distribute our products. In some cases, we market and sell our own products.\n\n_Dermatology_\n\nWe have developed unique, differentiated, prescription-strength and safe dermatologic products that support paths to healing among various key dermatologic conditions. Our products are primarily targeted at the treatment of redness and irritation, the management of scars and symptoms of eczema/atopic dermatitis. We are strategically focused on introducing innovative new products that are supported by human clinical data with applications that address specific dermatological procedures currently in demand. In addition, we look for markets where we can provide effective product line extensions and pricing to new product families.\n\nIn the United States, we sell our prescription and office dispense dermatology products through a distributor, including Epicyn® Facial Cleanser, Levicyn® Antimicrobial Dermal Spray, Levicyn® Gel, Levicyn® Spray Gel, Celacyn® Scar Management Gel, Lasercyn® Dermal Spray and Lasercyn Gel®.\n\nIn October 2022, we launched two new over-the-counter dermatology products in the United States, Reliefacyn® Advanced Itch-Burn-Rash-Pain Relief Hydrogel for the alleviation of red bumps, rashes, shallow skin fissures, peeling, and symptoms of eczema/atopic dermatitis, and Rejuvacyn® Advanced Skin Repair Cooling Mist for management of minor skin irritations following cosmetic procedures as well as daily skin health and hydration. \n\nIn June 2022, the Natural Products Association certified Rejuvacyn Advanced as a Natural Personal Care Product. Reliefacyn Advanced received the National Eczema Association Seal of AcceptanceTM in 2023.\n\nIn January 2023, we launched a line of office dispense products exclusively for skin care professionals, including two new prescription strength dermatology products, Reliefacyn Plus Advanced Itch-Burn-Rash-Pain Relief Hydrogel and Rejuvacyn Plus Skin Repair Cooling Mist. These products, along with Regenacyn Plus Scar Gel, are marketed and sold directly to dermatology practices and medical spas.\n\nIn January 2024, we launched LumacynTM Clarifying Mist, a direct-to-consumer skin care product in the United States. Lumacyn is an all-natural daily toner to soothe skin, reduce redness and irritation, and manage blemishes by reducing infection.\n\nOur consumer products are available through Amazon.com, our online store and third-party distributors.\n\nWe sell dermatology products in Europe and Asia through distributors. In these international markets, we have a network of partners, ranging from country specific distributors to large pharmaceutical companies to full-service sales and marketing companies. We work with our international partners to create products they can market in their home country. Some products we develop and manufacture are custom label while others use branding we have already developed. We have created or co-developed a wide range of products for international markets using our core HOCl technology.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \n_First Aid and Wound Care_\n\nOur HOCl-based wound care products are intended for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds as well as first- and second-degree burns, and as an intraoperative irrigation treatment. They work by first removing foreign material and debris from the skin surface and moistening the skin, thereby improving wound healing. Secondly, our HOCl products assist in the wound healing process by removing microorganisms. HOCl is an important constituent of our innate immune system, formed and released by the macrophages during phagocytosis. Highly organized cell structures such as human tissue can tolerate the action of our wound care solution while single-celled microorganisms cannot, making our products advantageous to other wound-irrigation and antiseptic solutions. Due to its unique chemistry, our wound treatment solution is also much more stable than similar products on the market and therefore maintains much higher levels of hypochlorous acid over its shelf life.\n\nIn the United States, we sell our wound care products directly to hospitals, physicians, nurses, and other healthcare practitioners and indirectly through non-exclusive distribution arrangements. In Europe, the Middle East and Asia, we sell our wound care products through a diverse network of distributors.\n\nIn March 2021, we received approval to market and use our HOCl products as biocides under Article 95 of the European Biocidal Products Regulation in France, Germany and Portugal. The approval applies to our products MucoClyns™ for human hygiene to be marketed and commercialized by us, MicrocynAH® for animal heath marketed and commercialized through our partner, Petagon Limited, and MicroSafe for disinfectant use to be marketed and commercialized through our partner, MicroSafe Group DMCC.\n\nIn June 2022, the Natural Products Association certified Microcyn OTC as a Natural Personal Care Product in the United States.\n\nIn June 2023, we announced a new application of our HOCl technology for intraoperative pulse lavage irrigation treatment, which can replace commonly used IV bags in a variety of surgical procedures. The intraoperative pulse lavage container is designed to be used in combination with a pulse lavage irrigation device, or flush gun, for abdominal, laparoscopic, orthopedic, and periprosthetic procedures. It is in trial use by hospitals in Europe and launched in the U.S. in November 2023.\n\nIn April 2024, we announced expansion of our Microcyn Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Solution products line, now available in 250mL, 450mL and 990mL sizes to meet the diverse needs of healthcare professionals and patients.\n\nIn July 2024, we announced an expansion of our distributor base in Europe through a new partnership with Smart Healthcare Company (SHC) s.r.o. for the distribution of Microdacyn60® wound care products into Ukraine.\n\nIn August, 2024, we entered into a distribution agreement with Medline Industries, LP, for the marketing and distribution of our wound care products in the United States. The agreement is for an initial term of five years, subject to automatic one-year renewal periods. In October 2024, we entered into an amendment to the agreement which allows Medline to also sell our wound care products in Canada, as well as to sell additional over-the-counter wound care products to retailers in both countries.\n\n_Eye Care_\n\nIn September 2021, we launched Ocucyn® Eyelid & Eyelash Cleanser, which is sold directly to consumers on Amazon.com, through our online store, and through third party distributors. Ocucyn Eyelid & Eyelash Cleanser, designed for everyday use, is a safe, gentle, and effective solution for good eyelid and eyelash hygiene.\n\nOur prescription product Acuicyn® Eyelid & Eyelash Cleanser is a prescription solution for symptoms of blepharitis and the daily hygiene of eyelids and lashes and helps manage red, itchy, crusty and inflamed eyes. It is strong enough to kill the bacteria that causes discomfort, fast enough to provide near instant relief, and gentle enough to use as often as needed.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \nIn international markets we rely on distribution partners to sell our eye products. In May 2020, we entered into an expanded license and distribution agreement with our existing partner, Brill International S.L., for our Microdacyn60® Eye Care HOCl-based product. Under the license and distribution agreement, Brill has the right to market and distribute our eye care product under the private label Ocudox in Italy, Germany, Spain, Portugal, France, and the United Kingdom for a period of 10 years, subject to meeting annual minimum sales quantities. In return, Brill paid us a one-time fee, and the agreed upon supply prices. In parts of Asia, Dyamed Biotech markets our eye product under the private label Ocucyn.\n\n_Oral, Dental and Nasal Care_\n\nWe sell a variety of oral, dental, and nasal products around the world.\n\nIn international markets, our product Microdacyn60 Oral Care treats mouth and throat infections and thrush. Microdacyn60 assists in reducing inflammation and pain, provides soothing cough relief and does not contain any harmful chemicals. It does not stain teeth, is non-irritating, non-sensitizing, has no contraindications and is ready for use with no mixing or dilution.\n\nOur international nasal care product Sinudox™ based on our HOCl technology is an electrolyzed solution intended for nasal irrigation.

In other parts of the world, we partner with distributors to sell Sinudox.\n\n_Podiatry_\n\nOur HOCl-based wound care products are also indicated for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. In the United States, we sell our wound care products directly to podiatrists as well as hospitals, nurses, and other healthcare practitioners and indirectly through non-exclusive distribution arrangements. In Europe, we sell our wound care products for podiatric use through a diverse network of distributors.\n\nIn April 2023, we launched PodiacynTM Advanced Everyday Foot Care direct to consumers for over-the-counter use in the United States, intended for management of foot odors, infections, and irritations, as well as daily foot health and hygiene. Podiacyn is available through Amazon.com, our online store and third-party distributors.\n\n_Animal Health Care_\n\nMicrocynAH® is an HOCl-based topical product that cleans, debrides and treats a wide spectrum of animal wounds and infections. It is intended for the safe and rapid treatment of a variety of animal afflictions including cuts, burns, lacerations, rashes, hot spots, rain rot, post-surgical sites, pink eye symptoms and wounds to the outer ear.\n\nFor our animal health products sold in the U.S. and Canada, we partner with Compana Pet Brands. Compana distributes non-prescription products to national pet-store retail chains and farm animal specialty stores, such as PetSmart, Tractor Supply, Cabela’s, PetExpress, Bass Pro Shops, and Menards. In August 2022, we announced the launch of a MicrocynVS® line of products exclusively for veterinarians for the management of wound, skin, ear and eye afflictions in all animal species.\n\nFor the Asian and European markets, in May 2019 we partnered with Petagon an international importer and distributor of quality pet food and products for an initial term of five years. We supply Petagon with all MicrocynAH products sold by Petagon. In August 2020, Petagon received a license from the People’s Republic of China for the import of veterinary drug products manufactured by us. This is the highest classification Petagon and Sonoma can receive for animal health products in China.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \n_Surface Disinfectants_\n\nOur HOCl technology has been formulated as a disinfectant and sanitizer solution for our partner MicroSafe and is sold in numerous countries. It is designed to be used to spray in aerosol format in areas and environments likely to serve as a breeding ground for the spread of infectious disease, which could result in epidemics or pandemics. The medical-grade surface disinfectant solution is used in hospitals worldwide to protect doctors and patients. In May 2020, Nanocyn® Disinfectant & Sanitizer received approval to be entered into the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, or ARTG for use against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, and was also authorized in Canada for use against COVID-19. Nanocyn has also met the stringent environmental health and social/ethical criteria of Good Environmental Choice Australia, or GECA, becoming one of the very few eco-certified, all-natural disinfectant solutions in Australia.\n\nThrough our partner MicroSafe, we sell hard surface disinfectant products into Europe, the Middle East and Australia.\n\nIn July 2021, we granted MicroSafe the non-exclusive right to sell and distribute Nanocyn in the United States provided that MicroSafe secure U.S. EPA approval. In April of 2022, MicroSafe secured the EPA approval for Nanocyn® Disinfectant & Sanitizer, meaning that it can now be sold in the United States as a surface disinfectant, and it was subsequently added to the EPA’s list N for use against COVID-19. In June 2022, the EPA added Nanocyn to List Q as a disinfectant for Emerging Viral Pathogens, including Ebola virus, Mpox, and SARS-CoV-2, and in March 2023 the EPA added Nanocyn to Lists G and H, for use against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), Salmonella, Norovirus, Poliovirus, and as a fungicide. Nanocyn also received the Green Seal® Certification after surpassing a series of rigorous standards that measure environmental health, sustainability and product performance. Nanocyn is currently sold by MicroSafe in Europe, the Middle East and Australia.\n\nIn August 2024, we announced that the Australian TGA approved extended claims for Nanocyn for use against Candida auris (C. auris) and Clostritium Difficile (C. diff.) in ten minutes.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nInvestors and others should note that we announce material financial information using our company website (www.sonomapharma.com), our investor relations website (ir.sonomapharma.com), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and webcasts.

The expense for each period is primarily related to the use of our deferred tax asset in Mexico and, to a lesser extent, our deferred tax asset in Netherlands.\n\n**_Net Loss_**\n\nThe following table provides the net loss for each period along with the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n(In thousands, except per share data) | 2024 | 2023  \nNet loss | $| (610| ) | $| (1,484| )  \nWeighted-average shares outstanding: basic and diluted | 1,034 | 258  \nNet loss per share: basic and diluted | $| (0.59| ) | $| (5.75| )  \n  \n22  \n---  \n  \n**Comparison of the Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023**\n\n**Revenue**\n\nThe following table shows our consolidated total revenue and revenue by geographic region for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\n**Six Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n---  \n(In thousands) | 2024 | 2023 | $ Change | % Change  \nUnited States | $| 1,317 | $| 1,396 | $| (79| ) | (6%| )  \nEurope | 2,794 | 2,271 | 523 | 23%  \nAsia | 1,253 | 1,208 | 45 | 4%  \nLatin America | 1,345 | 747 | 598 | 80%  \nRest of the World | 261 | 536 | (275| ) | (51%| )  \nTotal | $| 6,970 | $| 6,158 | $| 812 | 13%  \n  \nThe decrease in United States revenue of $79,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of fluctuations in timing of orders of over-the-counter animal health care products.\n\nThe increase in Europe revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024 of $523,000 was the result of a general increase in demand for our products.\n\nThe increase in Latin America revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024 of $598,000 was primarily due to an increase in manufacturing orders.\n\nThe increase in Asia revenue of $45,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to timing of customer orders. The decrease in Rest of World revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024 of $275,000 was primarily due to timing of customer orders. Revenues from these regions tend to be choppy when viewed on a quarterly basis due to customers placing larger, but less frequent, orders to benefit from quantity discounts and reduced shipping costs when ordering larger quantities.\n\n**_Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit_**\n\nThe cost of revenue and gross profit metrics for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n\n**Six Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n---  \n(In thousands, except for percentages) | 2024 | 2023 | $ Change | % Change  \nCost of Revenues | $| 4,303 | $| 3,964 | $| 339 | 9%  \nCost of Revenue as a % of Revenues | 62% | 64%  \nGross Profit | $| 2,667 | $| 2,194 | $| 473 | 22%  \nGross Profit as a % of Revenues | 38% | 36%  \n  \nThe increase in gross profit of $473,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in revenue, overall product mix, volume as compared to the prior period and transportation in the prior period.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \n**_Research and Development Expense_**\n\nThe research and development expense metrics for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n\n**Six Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n---  \n(In thousands, except for percentages) | 2024 | 2023 | $ Change | % Change  \nResearch and Development Expense | $| 976 | $| 861 | $| 115 | 13%  \nResearch and Development Expense as a % of Revenues | 14% | 14%  \n  \nIncreases in research and development expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2024 of $115,000 was primarily due to increased product development and expanded regulatory efforts in the U.S. and Europe to support new product releases and increases in regulatory demands in Europe.\n\n**_Selling, General and Administrative Expense_**\n\nThe selling, general and administrative expense metrics for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n\n**Six Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n---  \n(In thousands, except for percentages) | 2024 | 2023 | Change | % Change  \nSelling, General and Administrative Expense | $| 3,714 | $| 3,781 | $| (67| ) | (2%| )  \nSelling, General and Administrative Expense as a % of Revenues | 53% | 61%  \n  \nThe decline in selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2024 of $67,000 was the result of ongoing efforts to contain expenses across all parts of the company.\n\n**_Other Income (Expense), net_**\n\nOther income (expense), net for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was $563,000 compared to other income (expense), net of $(301,000) for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The change in other income (expense), net primarily relates to exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n**_Income Tax Expense_**\n\nIncome tax expense for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $293,000 and $153,000, respectively. The expense for each period is primarily related to the use of our deferred tax asset in Mexico and, to a lesser extent, our deferred tax asset in Netherlands.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n**_Net Loss_**\n\nThe following table provides the net loss for each period along with the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share:\n\nSix Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n(In thousands, except per share data) | 2024 | 2023  \nNet loss | $| (1,753| ) | $| (2,902| )  \nWeighted-average shares outstanding: basic and diluted | 943 | 253  \nNet loss per share: basic and diluted | $| (1.86| ) | $| (11.47| )  \n  \n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nWe reported a net loss of $610,000 and $1,484,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1,753,000 and $2,902,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, our accumulated deficit amounted to $196,102,000 and $194,349,000, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4,078,000 and $3,128,000, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had working capital of $8,912,000 and $8,829,000, respectively.\n\n**Sources of Liquidity**\n\nSince our inception, substantially all of our operations have been financed through sales of equity securities. Other sources of financing that we have used to date include our revenues, as well as various loans and the sale of certain assets to customers.\n\nSince October 1, 2023, substantially all of our operations have been financed through cash on hand and the following transactions:\n\n· | Proceeds of $1,446,000, net of offering expenses, from the sale of common stock on October 26, 2023.  \n---|---  \n· | Proceeds of $343,000, net of offering expenses, from the sale of common stock on January 11, 2024.  \n· | Proceeds of $2,289,000, net of offering expenses, from the sale of common stock in the six months ended September 30, 2024.  \n  \n**Cash Flows**\n\nThe following table presents a summary of our consolidated cash flows for operating, investing and financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as well balances of cash and cash equivalents and working capital:\n\nSix Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n(In thousands) | 2024 | 2023  \nNet cash provided by (used in):  \nOperating activities | $| (558| ) | $| (1,446| )  \nInvesting activities | (31| ) | (19| )  \nFinancing activities | 2,080 | (264| )  \nEffect of exchange rates on cash | (541| ) | 46  \nNet change in cash and cash equivalents | 950 | (1,683| )  \nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of the period | 3,128 | 3,820  \nCash and cash equivalents, end of the period | $| 4,078 | $| 2,137  \nWorking capital (1), end of period | $| 8,912 | $| 8,277  \n(1) | Defined as current assets minus current liabilities.  \n---|---  \n  \n25  \n---  \n  \nNet cash used in operating activities during the six months ended September 30, 2024 was $558,000, primarily due to a net loss of $1,753,000 offset by decrease in prepaid expenses of $1,134,000.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities during the six months ended September 30, 2023 was $1,446,000, primarily due to a net loss of $2,902,000, offset by a decrease in accounts receivables of $375,000, a decrease in inventory of $403,000 and stock compensation of $307,000.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $31,000 for six months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to the purchase of equipment.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $19,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to purchases of equipment.\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $2,080,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to net proceeds from the sale of common stock of $2,289,000 offset by $241,000 of principal payments on a short-term loan related to financing of insurance premiums.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities was $264,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to principal payments on short-term debt.\n\n**Material Trends and Uncertainties**\n\nWe rely on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. In the future, a small number of customers may continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in any given period. These customers may not consistently purchase our products at a particular rate over any subsequent period.\n\nWe are exposed to risk from foreign currency devaluation for both the Mexico Peso and the Euro versus the US dollar. Risk related to foreign currency valuation tends to be unpredictable and can be affected by various factors outside of our control.\n\nWe face a substantial Mexico tax liability, intercompany debt, unpaid technical assistance charges and accrued interest. These amounts are due in 2027. At this time, management believes there are sufficient assets on the balance sheet to more than cover any tax obligation without interrupting our operations or business. We have engaged tax professionals to review all options to limit our exposure to these amounts and to proceed in a manner that is most advantageous to us.\n\nWe also closely monitor overall economic conditions and consumer sentiment and the prospect of a recession in the United States which may impact our financial results.\n\n**Use of Estimates**\n\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the dates of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions include reserves and write-downs related to receivables and inventories, the valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets, valuation of equity and the estimated amortization periods of upfront product licensing fees received from customers. Periodically, we evaluate and adjust estimates accordingly.\n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Transactions**\n\nWe currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \n**Item 3.** | **Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**  \n---|---  \n  \nAs a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item.\n\n**Item 4.** | **Controls and Procedures**  \n---|---  \n  \n**Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures**\n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of our most recent fiscal quarter. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the fact that material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting exist at period end.\n\nNotwithstanding our ineffective disclosure controls and procedures, management believes the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n**Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting**\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the  _2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework_ issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2024. We determined that there was a lack of separation of duties with preparation and review of the reported numbers, among other things. We believe we have taken steps to correct this, but the controls are currently being tested and have not been working for a sufficient period of time to remove this weakness.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \n**Management’s Remediation Measures**\n\nManagement, with oversight from the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, is actively engaged in remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses identified in the management’s evaluation of internal controls and procedures. Management has taken a number of actions to remediate the material weaknesses described above, including the following:\n\n· | Improved monitoring and risk assessment activities to address these control deficiencies.  \n---|---  \n· | Hired an experienced Chief Financial Officer and Controller in 2023.  \n· | Separated the preparation of the financial reports from review of the financial reports.  \n· | Developed and delivered further internal controls training to individuals associated with these control deficiencies and enhanced training provided to all personnel who have financial reporting or internal control responsibilities in these areas. The training includes a review of individual roles and responsibilities related to internal controls, proper oversight and reemphasizes the importance of completing the control procedures.  \n  \nThese improvements are targeted at strengthening our internal control over financial reporting and remediating the material weaknesses. We remain committed to an effective internal control environment, and management believes that these actions and the improvements management expects to achieve as a result will effectively remediate the material weaknesses. However, the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing that these controls operate effectively. As of the date of filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management is in the process of testing and evaluating these additional controls to determine whether they are operating effectively. We have hired appropriate accounting staff to establish effective internal controls and processes.\n\n**Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting**\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not finished testing our controls and sufficient time has not elapsed to make the determination these controls are operating effectively.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \n**PART II - OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1.** | **Legal Proceedings**  \n---|---  \n  \nOn occasion, we may be involved in legal matters arising in the ordinary course of our business including matters involving proprietary technology. While management believes that such matters are currently insignificant, matters arising in the ordinary course of business for which we are or could become involved in litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of comprehensive loss.\n\n**Item 1A.** | **Risk Factors**  \n---|---  \n  \nThere have been no material changes from risk factors previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC June 17, 2024.\n\n**Item 2.** | **Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds**  \n---|---  \n  \nWe did not issue any unregistered securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and through November 7, 2024.\n\n**Item 3.** | **Default Upon Senior Securities**  \n---|---  \n  \nWe did not default upon any senior securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Item 4.** | **Mine Safety Disclosures**  \n---|---  \n  \nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 5.** | **Other Information**  \n---|---  \n  \nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer adopted or terminated any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\n\nAmendment to Code of Business Conduct\n\nOn November 5, 2024, our Board of Directors adopted changes to our Code of Business Conduct (the “Code”). The Code governs the conduct of all our employees, directors and officers, including our management. The changes to the Code were made to update the Code to current best practices. In addition to some clerical changes, the Code now explicitly reflects the definition of “code of ethics” in Item 406 of Regulation S-K. The Code also updates reporting procedures, including updates to our anonymous reporting hotline. No waivers have been granted under the Code to date.\n\nA copy of the Code of Business Conduct of Sonoma Pharmaceuticals, Inc., as adopted by the Board of Directors on November 5, 2024, is filed as Exhibit 14.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nBonus Award to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\n\nOn November 5, 2024, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved a one-time cash bonus of $7,500 to Bruce Thornton, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, for contributions in obtaining a new 510(k) clearance for the Company’s products.\n\nApproval of Tax Gross-Up\n\nOn June 16, 2023, the Compensation Committee approved an equity award of 100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to each of Ms. Trombly and Mr. Thornton, to be issued on June 30, 2023, at a valuation based on the five day weighted-average stock price on the date of grant. In addition, the Compensation Committee approved a one-time cash payment by the Company as reimbursement for estimated taxes payable with respect to such equity awards. On November 5, 2024, the Compensation Committee approved an additional tax payment in the amount of $8,411 to of Ms. Trombly and $10,925 to Mr. Thornton to make up a deficiency in the prior reimbursement.\n\n29  \n---  \n  \n**Item 6.** | **Exhibits**  \n---|---  \n  \n**Exhibit Index**\n\n**Exhibit No.** | **Description**  \n---|---  \n3.1 | [Restated Certificate of Incorporation of

Business\nCorporate Information\nWe originally incorporated as Micromed Laboratories, Inc. in 1999 under the laws of the State of California. We changed our name to Oculus Innovative Sciences, Inc. in 2001.\nIn December 2006 we reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, and in December 2016 we changed our name to Sonoma Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nIn 2022, we relocated our principal executive offices from 645 Molly Lane, Suite 150, Woodstock, Georgia, 30189 to 5445 Conestoga Court, Suite 150, Boulder, Colorado\n80301. We have two active wholly-owned subsidiaries: Oculus Technologies of Mexico, S.A. de C.V., and Sonoma Pharmaceuticals Netherlands, B.V. Our fiscal year end is\nMarch 31. Our corporate telephone number is (800) 759-9305. Our websites are www.sonomapharma.com and www.sonomapharma.eu. The websites and any information\ncontained therein or connected thereto is not intended to be incorporated into this report.\nOverview\nWe are a global healthcare leader for developing and producing stabilized hypochlorous acid, or HOCl, products for a wide range of applications, including wound care, eye\ncare, oral care, dermatological conditions, podiatry, animal health care and non-toxic disinfectants. Our products are clinically proven to reduce itch, pain, scarring, and\nirritation safely and without damaging healthy tissue. In-vitro and clinical studies of HOCl show it to safely manage skin abrasions, lacerations, minor irritations, cuts, and\nintact skin. We sell our products either directly or via partners in 55 countries worldwide.\nBusiness Update\nOver the past year, we have continued our focus on growing our revenues while maintaining costs. Our human care revenues have grown as a result of adding new customers\nand distributors, and through organic growth from existing customers and distributors. We have also focused on introducing new products into multiple markets around the\nworld and increasing our regulatory reach by seeking new approvals and clearances.\n1\nSome of our recent business updates include:\n· On May 9, 2024, we announced expansion of our MicrocynAH® animal health care products in the Menards® chain of home improvement stores in the United States,\nthrough our partner Compana Pet Brands.\n· On April 9, 2024, we announced expansion of our Microcyn® Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Solution products line, now available in 250mL, 450mL and 990mL\nsizes to meet the diverse needs of healthcare professionals and patients.\n· On January 23, 2024, we launched LumacynTM Clarifying Mist, a new direct-to-consumer skincare product, in the United States. Lumacyn is an all-natural daily toner\nformulated with Microcyn® technology to soothe the skin, reduce redness and irritation, and manage blemishes by reducing infection.\n· On November 3, 2023, we launched our intraoperative pulse lavage irrigation treatment in the United States, a new application of its wound care technology developed\nin response to an unmet need for a non-toxic irrigation solution that can prevent infection and improve healing time.\n· On August 15, 2023, we announced that Reliefacyn® Advanced Itch-Burn-Rash-Pain Relief Hydrogel had received the National Eczema Association (NEA) Seal of\nAcceptance™.\n· On August 3, 2023, we announced the establishment of a Scientific Advisory Board, which will serve to inform the company's research and development activities,\nefforts to address areas of unmet need, and potential new areas of interest.\nWe continue to invest in research and development, both in the U.S. and internationally, for our core performance-stabilized hypochlorous acid, or HOCl, technology. We have\nan active pipeline of products and we continue to seek new regulatory clearances to expand potential markets we can sell our products into.\nBusiness Channels\nOur core market differentiation is based on being the leading developer and producer of stabilized hypochlorous acid, or HOCl, solutions. We have been in business for over 20\nyears, and in that time, we have developed significant scientific knowledge of how best to develop and manufacture HOCl products backed by decades of studies and data\ncollection. HOCl is known to be among the safest and most-effective ways to relieve itch, inflammation and burns while stimulating natural healing through increased\noxygenation and eliminating persistent microorganisms and biofilms.\nWe sell our products into many markets both in the U.S. and internationally. In international markets, we ship a variety of products to 55 countries. Our core strategy is to work\nwith partners both in the United States and around the world to market and distribute our products. In some cases, we market and sell our own products.\nDermatology\nWe have developed unique, differentiated, prescription-strength and safe dermatologic products that support paths to healing among various key dermatologic conditions. Our\nproducts are primarily targeted at the treatment of redness and irritation, the management of scars and symptoms of eczema/atopic dermatitis. We are strategically focused on\nintroducing innovative new products that are supported by human clinical data with applications that address specific dermatological procedures currently in demand. In\naddition, we look for markets where we can provide effective product line extensions and pricing to new product families.\n2\nIn the United States, we partner with EMC Pharma, LLC to sell our prescription dermatology products. Pursuant to our March 2021 agreement with EMC Pharma, we\nmanufacture products for EMC Pharma and EMC Pharma has the right to market, sell and distribute them to patients and customers for an initial term of five years, subject to\nmeeting minimum purchase and other requirements.\nIn September 2021, we launched a new over-the-counter product, Regenacyn® Advanced Scar Gel, which is clinically proven to improve the overall appearance of scars while\nreducing pain, itch and redness. On the same day, we launched Regenacyn® Plus, a prescription-strength scar gel which is available as an office dispense product through\nphysician offices.\nIn October 2022, we launched two new over-the-counter dermatology products in the United States, Reliefacyn® Advanced Itch-Burn-Rash-Pain Relief Hydrogel for the\nalleviation of red bumps, rashes, shallow skin fissures, peeling, and symptoms of eczema/atopic dermatitis, and Rejuvacyn® Advanced Skin Repair Cooling Mist for\nmanagement of minor skin irritations following cosmetic procedures as well as daily skin health and hydration.\nIn June 2022, the Natural Products Association certified Rejuvacyn Advanced as a Natural Personal Care Product. Reliefacyn Advanced received the National Eczema\nAssociation Seal of AcceptanceTM in 2023.\nIn January 2023, we launched a line of office dispense products exclusively for skin care professionals, including two new prescription strength dermatology products,\nReliefacyn® Plus Advanced Itch-Burn-Rash-Pain Relief Hydrogel and Rejuvacyn® Plus Skin Repair Cooling Mist. These products, along with Regenacyn® Plus Scar Gel, are\nmarketed and sold directly to dermatology practices and medical spas.\nIn January 2024, we launched LumacynTM Clarifying Mist, a direct-to-consumer skin care product in the United States. Lumacyn is an all-natural daily toner to soothe skin,\nreduce redness and irritation, and manage blemishes by reducing infection.\nOur consumer products are available through Amazon.com, our online store and third-party distributors.\nWe sell dermatology products in Europe and Asia through distributors. In these international markets, we have a network of partners, ranging from country specific distributors\nto large pharmaceutical companies to full-service sales and marketing companies. We work with our international partners to create products they can market in their home\ncountry. Some products we develop and manufacture are custom label while others use branding we have already developed. We have created or co-developed a wide range of\nproducts for international markets using our core HOCl technology.\nFirst Aid and Wound Care\nOur HOCl-based wound care products are intended for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds as well as first- and second-degree burns, and as an intraoperative irrigation\ntreatment. They work by first removing foreign material and debris from the skin surface and moistening the skin, thereby improving wound healing. Secondly, our HOCl\nproducts assist in the wound healing process by removing microorganisms. HOCl is an important constituent of our innate immune system, formed and released by the\nmacrophages during phagocytosis. Highly organized cell structures such as human tissue can tolerate the action of our wound care solution while single-celled microorganisms\ncannot, making our products advantageous to other wound-irrigation and antiseptic solutions. Due to its unique chemistry, our wound treatment solution is also much more\nstable than similar products on the market and therefore maintains much higher levels of hypochlorous acid over its shelf life.\nIn the United States, we sell our wound care products directly to hospitals, physicians, nurses, and other healthcare practitioners and indirectly through non-exclusive\ndistribution arrangements. In Europe, the Middle East and Asia, we sell our wound care products through a diverse network of distributors.\n3\nTo respond to market demand for our HOCl technology-based products, we launched our first direct to consumer over-the-counter product in the United States in February\n2021. Microcyn® OTC Wound and Skin Cleanser is formulated for home use without prescription to help manage and cleanse wounds, minor cuts, and burns, including\nsunburns and other skin irritations. Microcyn OTC is available without prescription through Amazon.com, our online store and third-party distributors.\nIn March 2021, we received approval to market and use our HOCl products as biocides under Article 95 of the European Biocidal Products Regulation in France, Germany and\nPortugal. The approval applies to our products MucoClyns™ for human hygiene to be marketed and commercialized by us, MicrocynAH® for animal heath marketed and\ncommercialized through our partner, Petagon Limited, and MicroSafe for disinfectant use to be marketed and commercialized through our partner, MicroSafe Group DMCC.\nIn June 2022, the Natural Products Association certified Microcyn OTC as a Natural Personal Care Product in the United States.\nIn June 2023, we announced a new application of our HOCl technology for intraoperative pulse lavage irrigation treatment, which can replace commonly used IV bags in a\nvariety of surgical procedures. The intraoperative pulse lavage container is designed to be used in combination with a pulse lavage irrigation device, or flush gun, for\nabdominal, laparoscopic, orthopedic, and periprosthetic procedures. It is in trial use by hospitals in Europe and launched in the U.S. in November 2023.\nOn April 9, 2024, we announced expansion of our Microcyn® Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Solution products line, now available in 250mL, 450mL and 990mL sizes to\nmeet the diverse needs of healthcare professionals and patients.\nEye Care\nOur prescription product Acuicyn™ is an antimicrobial prescription solution for the treatment of blepharitis and the daily hygiene of eyelids and lashes and helps manage red,\nitchy, crusty and inflamed eyes. It is strong enough to kill the bacteria that causes discomfort, fast enough to provide near instant relief, and gentle enough to use as often as\nneeded. In the United States, our partner EMC Pharma sells Acuicyn through its distribution network.\nIn international markets we rely on distribution partners to sell our eye products. In May 2020, we entered into an expanded license and distribution agreement with our existing\npartner, Brill International S.L. for our Microdacyn60® Eye Care HOCl-based product. Under the license and distribution agreement, Brill has the right to market and distribute\nour eye care product under the private label Ocudox™ in Italy, Germany, Spain, Portugal, France, and the United Kingdom for a period of 10 years, subject to meeting annual\nminimum sales quantities. In return, Brill paid us a one-time fee, and the agreed upon supply prices. In parts of Asia, Dyamed Biotech markets our eye product under the private\nlabel Ocucyn.\nIn September 2021, we launched Ocucyn® Eyelid & Eyelash Cleanser, which is sold directly to consumers on Amazon.com, through our online store, and through third party\ndistributors. Ocucyn® Eyelid & Eyelash Cleanser, designed for everyday use, is a safe, gentle, and effective solution for good eyelid and eyelash hygiene.\nOral, Dental and Nasal Care\nWe sell a variety of oral, dental, and nasal products around the world.\nIn international markets, our product Microdacyn60® Oral Care treats mouth and throat infections and thrush. Microdacyn60 assists in reducing inflammation and pain,\nprovides soothing cough relief and does not contain any harmful chemicals.

Podiacyn is available through Amazon.com, our online store and third-party distributors.\nAnimal Health Care\nMicrocynAH® is an HOCl-based topical product that cleans, debrides and treats a wide spectrum of animal wounds and infections. It is intended for the safe and rapid\ntreatment of a variety of animal afflictions including cuts, burns, lacerations, rashes, hot spots, rain rot, post-surgical sites, pink eye symptoms and wounds to the outer ear.\nFor our animal health products sold in the U.S. and Canada, we partner with Compana Pet Brands. Compana distributes non-prescription products to national pet-store retail\nchains and farm animal specialty stores, such as PetSmart, Tractor Supply, Cabela’s, PetExpress, Bass Pro Shops, and Menards. In August 2022, we announced the launch of a\nMicrocynVS® line of products exclusively for veterinarians for the management of wound, skin, ear and eye afflictions in all animal species.\nFor the Asian and European markets, in May 2019 we partnered with Petagon an international importer and distributor of quality pet food and products for an initial term of\nfive years. We supply Petagon with all MicrocynAH products sold by Petagon. In August 2020, Petagon received a license from the People’s Republic of China for the import\nof veterinary drug products manufactured by us. This is the highest classification Petagon and Sonoma can receive for animal health products in China.\nSurface Disinfectants\nOur HOCl technology has been formulated as a disinfectant and sanitizer solution for our partner MicroSafe and is sold in numerous countries. It is designed to be used to spray\nin aerosol format in areas and environments likely to serve as a breeding ground for the spread of infectious disease, which could result in epidemics or pandemics.

In June 2022, the EPA added Nanocyn to List Q as a disinfectant for Emerging Viral Pathogens, including\nEbola virus, Mpox, and SARS-CoV-2, and in March 2023 the EPA added Nanocyn to Lists G and H, for use against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA),\nSalmonella, Norovirus, Poliovirus, and as a fungicide.

At March 31, 2024, customer B represented 13% of our net accounts receivable balance and customer D\nrepresented 17% of our net accounts receivable balance. At March 31, 2023, customer B represented 22% of our net accounts receivable balance and customer D represented\n21% of our net accounts receivable balance. For the year ended March 31, 2024, customer A represented 17%, customer B represented 15% and customer C represented 14% of\nnet revenues. For the year ended March 31, 2023, customer A represented 11%, customer B represented 16% and customer C represented 18% of net revenues.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part on an ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for product technology and know-how, to operate without infringing proprietary rights of\nothers, and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. We seek to protect a proprietary position by, among other methods, filing, when possible, U.S. and\nforeign patent applications relating to our technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the business. We have patented certain aspects of our HOCl\ntechnology in the United States and worldwide. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and\nmaintain a proprietary position.\nAlthough we work diligently to protect proprietary technology, there are no assurances that any patent will be issued from currently pending patent applications or from future\npatent applications. The scope of any patent protection may not exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages, and any patent may not be held valid if subsequently\nchallenged, and others may claim rights in or ownership of patents and proprietary rights. Furthermore, others may develop products similar to ours and may duplicate any of\nthe products or design around patents.\nWe have also filed for trademark protection for marks used with products in each of the following regions: United States, Europe, Canada, certain countries in Central and\nSouth America, including Mexico and Brazil, certain countries in the Middle East and certain countries in Asia, including Japan, China, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea,\nIndia and Australia. In addition to patents and trademarks, we rely on trade secret and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect\nintellectual property rights. We believe that in order to have a competitive advantage, we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of technologies. Employees,\nconsultants and advisors are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment, consulting or advisory relationships. Employees, consultants\nand advisors with whom we expect to work with are also required to disclose and assign to us all inventions made in the course of a working relationship with them, while\nusing intellectual property or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of\nthe products or to wrongfully obtain or use information that is regarded as proprietary.\nCompetition\nWe compete globally across six main channels: dermatology, eye, nasal and oral care, wound and acute care, podiatry, animal health care and surface disinfectants with our\nHOCl technology.\nDermatology\nOur dermatology products are at the forefront of HOCl-based solutions, a safe and highly effective active ingredient designed to relieve itching and burning and act as a highly\neffective antimicrobial agent. We believe no other solutions on the market provide the same patient benefits at the levels of safety and cost. Our HOCl-based solutions face\nsignificant competition in the United States from prescription products including corticosteroids, topical steroids and topical antibiotics. Our opportunity as an adjunct to these\nsteroids is based on the insight that many doctors and patients limit steroid and antibiotic use due to potential side effects. These side effects include bacterial resistance,\nstinging, burning and inflammation for topical antibiotics and stretch marks, easy bruising, tearing of the skin and, to a lesser extent, enlarged blood vessels for topical steroids.\nOur HOCl-based products are safe, non-toxic and have shown few side effects in clinical studies.\n14\nWound and Acute Care Markets\nSimilar to our dermatology products, our HOCl-based wound and acute care solutions provide improved efficacy at lower costs than traditional acute care products. Our HOCl-\nbased solutions compete with topical anti-infectives and antibiotics, as well as some advanced wound technologies, such as skin substitutes, growth factors and delayed release\nsilver-based dressings. Our opportunity in this space relative to antibiotics is based on the insight that competing antibiotic solutions may have resistance-building properties.\nFactors Affecting Competitive Position\nWhile some other companies are able to produce small molecule, HOCl-based formulations, based on our research, their products may become unstable after a relatively short\nperiod of time or have large ranges of effectiveness. We believe our HOCl-based solutions are among the most stable therapeutics available.\nSome of our competitors in the dermatology, wound care, eye, nasal and oral care, podiatry, animal health care and surface disinfectant markets enjoy several competitive\nadvantages. These include:\n· greater name recognition;\n· established relationships with healthcare professionals, patients and third-party payors;\n· established distribution networks;\n· additional product lines and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives;\n· experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, obtaining regulatory approval for products and marketing; and\n· financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patient support.\nGovernment Regulation\nGovernment authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and foreign countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development,\ntesting, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, sampling, marketing, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, biologics and medical devices. All\nof our products in development will require regulatory approval or clearance by government agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are\nsubject to rigorous pre-clinical and clinical trials and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries. Various federal, state, local\nand foreign statutes and regulations also govern testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, distribution and record-keeping related to such products and their marketing.\nThe process of obtaining these approvals and clearances, and the subsequent process of maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign\nstatutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In addition, statutes, rules, regulations and policies may change and new legislation\nor regulations may be issued that could delay such approvals.\nMedical Device Regulation\nTo date, we have received 21 510(k) clearances for use of products as medical devices in tissue care management, such as cleaning, debridement, lubricating, moistening and\ndressing, including for acute and chronic wounds, and in dermatology applications. Any future product candidates or new applications classified as medical devices will require\nclearance by the FDA.\nMedical devices are subject to FDA clearance and extensive regulation under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act,\nmedical devices are classified into one of three classes: Class I, Class II or Class III. The classification of a device into one of these three classes generally depends on the\ndegree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices may also be designated unclassified. Unclassified\ndevices are legally marketed pre-amendment devices for which a classification regulation has yet to be finalized and for which a pre-market approval is not required.\n15\nClass I devices are devices for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to a set of general controls. These general controls include compliance with the\napplicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, which sets forth good manufacturing practice requirements; facility registration, device listing and product\nreporting of adverse medical events; truthful and non-misleading labeling; and promotion of the device only for its cleared or approved intended uses. Class II devices are also\nsubject to these general controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Review and clearance by\nthe FDA for these devices is typically accomplished through the 510(k) pre-market notification procedure. When 510(k) clearance is sought, a sponsor must submit a pre-\nmarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device. If the FDA agrees that the proposed device is substantially\nequivalent to the predicate device, then 510(k) clearance to market will be granted. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its\nsafety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a pre-market approval.\nClinical trials are almost always required to support a pre-market approval application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) pre-market notification. These trials generally\nrequire submission of an application for an investigational device exemption. An investigational device exemption must be supported by pre-clinical data, such as animal and\nlaboratory testing results, which show that the device is safe to test in humans and that the study protocols are scientifically sound. The FDA must approve an investigational\ndevice exemption, in advance, for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and is eligible for more abbreviated investigational\ndevice exemption requirements.\nBoth before and after a medical device is commercially distributed, manufacturers and marketers of the device have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA\nreviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential\nproblems with marketed medical devices. Device manufacturers are subject to periodic and unannounced inspection by the FDA for compliance with the Quality System\nRegulation, which sets forth the Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for the design,\nmanufacture, packaging, servicing, labeling, storage, installation and distribution of all finished medical devices intended for human use.\nOn November 30, 2023, the FDA issued a proposed rule to classify certain wound dressings and liquid wound washes containing antimicrobials with a low level of\nantimicrobial resistance concern, including hypochlorous acid, into Class II medical devices. If finalized as proposed, we would be required to submit new 510(k) applications\nfor our products and to demonstrate compliance with special controls that require specific information relating to performance testing and technical specifications, specific\nlabeling requirements, and other requirements to mitigate the risks to health and demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Our existing devices could\nserve as predicates for the new devices. The FDA is proposing that manufacturers will need to demonstrate compliance with applicable special controls within six months after\nthe effective date of the rule, when finalized.\nFDA regulations prohibit the advertising and promotion of a medical device for any use outside the scope of a 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval or for unsupported\nsafety or effectiveness claims. Although the FDA does not regulate physicians’ practice of medicine, the FDA does regulate manufacturer communications with respect to off-\nlabel use.\nIf the FDA finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply with FDA laws and regulations or that a medical device is ineffective or poses an unreasonable health risk, it can\ninstitute or seek a wide variety of enforcement actions and remedies, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe actions such as:\n· imposing fines, injunctions and civil penalties\n· requiring a recall or seizure of products\n· implementing operating restrictions, which can include a partial suspension or total shutdown of production\n· refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products\n· withdrawing 510(k) clearance or pre-market approvals already granted\n· criminal prosecution\nThe FDA also has the authority to require a company to repair, replace, or refund the cost of any medical device.\nThe FDA also administers certain controls over the export of medical devices from the United States, as international sales of medical devices that have not received FDA\nclearance are subject to FDA export requirements. Additionally, each foreign country subjects such medical devices to its own regulatory requirements. In the European Union,\nthere is a single regulatory approval process and approval is represented by the presence of a CE marking.\n16\nOther Regulation in the United States\nThe Physician Payments Sunshine Act\nThe Physician Payments Sunshine Act signed into law in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act requires manufacturers of medical devices, drugs, biologicals, and medical\nsupplies to track and report certain payments made to and transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as to report certain ownership and investment\ninterests held by physicians and their immediate family members. These manufacturers must report annually to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services any direct or\nindirect payments and transfers of value of $10 or more, or annual aggregate of $100 or more, made to physicians or to a third party at the request of or on behalf of a\nphysician, including dentists. Payment includes: consulting fees, compensation for services other than consulting, honoraria, gifts, entertainment, food, travel (including the\nspecified destinations), education, research, charitable contribution, royalty or license, current or prospective ownership or investment interest, direct compensation for serving\nas faculty or as a speaker for a medical education program, grants, any other nature of the payment, or other transfer of value. Manufacturers face monetary penalties for non-\ncompliance. Certain payments related to research must be reported separately. Product samples intended for patient use need not be reported.\nHealth Care Coverage and Reimbursement by Third-Party Payors\nCommercial success in marketing and selling products depends, in part, on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party health care payors, such as\ngovernment and private health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services.\nGovernment and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, and managed-care arrangements, are\ncontinuing in many countries where we do business, including the United States. These changes are causing the marketplace to be more cost-conscious and focused on the\ndelivery of more cost-effective medical products. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies, and managed-care plans\ncontrol costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or treatments. This has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among\ncustomers for our products. Some third-party payors also require that a favorable coverage determination be made for new or innovative medical devices or therapies before\nthey will provide reimbursement of those medical devices or therapies. Even though a new medical product may have been cleared or approved for commercial distribution, we\nmay find limited demand for the product until adequate coverage and reimbursement have been obtained from governmental and other third-party payors.\nFraud and Abuse Laws\nIn the United States, we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, which, among other things, prohibit the offer or acceptance of\nremuneration intended to induce or in exchange for the purchase of products or services reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and the submission of false or\nfraudulent claims with the government. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act and comparable state laws. These laws regulate the\nactivities of entities involved in the healthcare industry, such as Sonoma, by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements such entities may have with healthcare providers who\nuse or recommend the use of medical products, including, for example, sales and marketing programs, advisory boards and research and educational grants. In addition, in order\nto ensure that healthcare entities comply with healthcare laws, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that\nhealthcare entities institute effective compliance programs. To assist in the development of effective compliance programs, the Office of Inspector General has issued model\nCompliance Program Guidance, materials for a variety of healthcare entities which, among other things, identify practices to avoid that may implicate the federal Anti-\nKickback Statute and other relevant laws and describes elements of an effective compliance program. While compliance with the Compliance Program Guidance materials is\nvoluntary, a California law requires pharmaceutical and devices manufacturers to initiate compliance programs that incorporate the Compliance Program Guidance and the July\n2002 Pharmaceuticals Research and Manufacturers of America Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals.\nDue to the scope and breadth of the provisions of some of these laws, it is possible that some of our practices might be challenged by the government under one or more of\nthese laws in the future. Violations of these laws, which are discussed more fully below, can lead to civil and criminal penalties, damages, imprisonment, fines, exclusion from\nparticipation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. Any such violations could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n17\nAnti-Kickback Laws\nOur operations are subject to federal and state anti-kickback laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving,\noffering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual for a good or service reimbursed under a federal healthcare program, or the\nfurnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The\ndefinition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, waiver\nof co-payments, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Because the Anti-Kickback Statute makes illegal a wide variety of common, even beneficial, business\narrangements, the Office of Inspector General was tasked with issuing regulations, commonly known as “safe harbors,” that describe arrangements where the risk of illegal\nremuneration is minimal. As long as all of the requirements of a particular safe harbor are strictly met, the entity engaging in that activity will not be prosecuted under the\nfederal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that\nprosecution will be pursued. However, business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement\nauthorities, such as the Office of Inspector General. Our agreements to pay compensation to our advisory board members and physicians who provide other services for us may\nbe subject to challenge to the extent they do not fall within relevant safe harbors under state and federal anti-kickback laws. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar\nto the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which apply to the referral of patients for health care services reimbursed by Medicaid, and some have adopted such laws with respect to\nprivate insurance. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are subject to significant fines and penalties and may lead to a company being excluded from participating in federal\nhealth care programs.\nFalse Claims Laws\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly filing a false claim, knowingly causing the filing of a false claim, or knowingly using false statements to obtain payment\nfrom the federal government. Certain violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitute per se violations of the False Claims Act. Under the False Claims Act, such suits are\nknown as “qui tam” actions. Individuals may file suit on behalf of the government and share in any amounts received by the government pursuant to a settlement. In addition,\ncertain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, where the federal government created financial incentives\nfor states to enact false claims laws consistent with the federal False Claims Act. As more states enact such laws, we expect the number of qui tam lawsuits to increase. Qui tam\nactions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend false claims actions, pay fines or be excluded from\nMedicare, Medicaid or other federal or state government healthcare programs as a result of investigations arising out of such actions.\nHIPAA\nTwo federal crimes were created under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare\nmatters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. The false\nstatements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in\nconnection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\n18\nHealth Information Privacy and Security\nIndividually identifiable health information is subject to an array of federal and state regulation. Federal rules promulgated pursuant to HIPAA regulate the use and disclosure of\nhealth information by “covered entities.” Covered entities include individual and institutional health care providers from which we may receive individually identifiable health\ninformation. These regulations govern, among other things, the use and disclosure of health information for research purposes, and require the covered entity to obtain the\nwritten authorization of the individual before using or disclosing health information for research. Failure of the covered entity to obtain such authorization could subject the\ncovered entity to civil and criminal penalties. We may experience delays and complex negotiations in dealing with each entity’s differing interpretation of the regulations and\nwhat is required for compliance. Also, where our customers or contractors are covered entities, including hospitals, universities, physicians or clinics, we may be required by\nthe HIPAA regulations to enter into “business associate” agreements that subject the company to certain privacy and security requirements. In addition, many states have laws\nthat apply to the use and disclosure of health information, and these laws could also affect the manner in which we conduct research and other aspects of business. Such state\nlaws are not preempted by the federal privacy law when such laws afford greater privacy protection to the individual than the federal law. While activities to assure compliance\nwith health information privacy laws are a routine business practice, we are unable to predict the extent to which resources may be diverted in the event of an investigation or\nenforcement action with respect to such laws.\nForeign Regulation\nWhether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, approval of a product by the applicable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained before clinical trials\nor marketing of the product in those countries can begin. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA\napproval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement also vary greatly from country to country. Although governed\nby the applicable country, clinical trials conducted outside of the United States typically are administered under a three-phase sequential process similar to that discussed above\nfor medical devices.\nEuropean Union Regulation\nMedical Device Regulation\nOur products are classified as medical devices in the European Union. In order to sell medical device products within the European Union, we are required to comply with the\nrequirements of the Medical Devices Regulation, and its national implementations, including affixing CE markings on products. The CE marking indicates a product’s\ncompliance with EU legislation and so enables the sale of products throughout the European Economic Area, or the EEA, comprising the 28 Member States of the EU and\nEuropean Free Trade Association, or EFTA, countries Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein. In order to comply with the Medical Devices Regulation, we must meet certain\nrequirements relating to the safety and performance of products and, prior to marketing products, we must successfully undergo verification of products’ regulatory compliance,\nor conformity assessment.\nThe Medical Devices Regulation was adopted in the EU on May 26, 2017 to replace the existing Medical Device Directive, and became applicable on May 26, 2021, with a\ntransition period until May 26, 2024, which was been extended to December 31, 2028 for non-implantable Class IIb and lower risk devices. Under the new Medical Devices\nRegulation, certain devices are classified in higher classes, new devices are classified, and certain new obligations are imposed on manufacturers and distributors.\nManufacturers are required to engage a medical device expert and carry insurance for possible liability claims. In addition, the pre-market approval and post-market\nsurveillance requirements are enhanced. The European Database for Medical Devices, or Eudamed, will hold and publish information on medical devices collected from the\nEuropean Commission and the national authorities.\n19\nMedical devices are divided into three regulatory classes: Class I, Class IIB and Class III. The nature of the conformity assessment procedures depends on the regulatory class\nof the product. In order to comply with the examination, we completed, among other things, a risk analysis and presented clinical data, which demonstrated that our products\nmet the performance specifications claimed by us, provided sufficient evidence of adequate assessment of unwanted side effects and demonstrated that the benefits to the\npatient outweigh the risks associated with the device. We are subject to continued supervision and are required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate\nauthorities. We are also required to comply with additional national requirements that are beyond the scope of the Medical Devices Regulation.\nWe received a CE certificate for 39 of our Class IIB medical devices, which allows us to affix CE markings on these products and sell them in Europe. We may not be able to\nmaintain the requirements established for CE markings for any or all of our products or be able to produce these products in a timely and profitable manner while complying\nwith the requirements of the Medical Devices Regulation and other regulatory requirements.\nEuropean Good Manufacturing Process\nIn the European Union, the manufacture of pharmaceutical products and clinical trial supplies is subject to good manufacturing practice as set forth in the relevant laws and\nguidelines. Compliance with good manufacturing practice is generally assessed by the competent regulatory authorities. They may conduct inspections of relevant facilities, and\nreview manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each drug manufacturing\nfacility must be approved. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product.\nMexican Regulation\nThe Ministry of Health is the authority in charge of sanitary controls in Mexico. Sanitary controls are a group of practices related to the orientation, education, testing,\nverification and application of security measures and sanctions exercised by the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health is responsible for the issuance of Official Mexican\nStandards and specifications for drugs subject to the provisions of the General Health Law, which govern the process and specifications of drugs, including the obtaining,\npreparing, manufacturing, maintaining, mixing, conditioning, packaging, handling, transporting, distributing, storing and supplying of products to the public at large. In\naddition, a medical device is defined as a device that may contain antiseptics or germicides used in surgical practice or in the treatment of continuity solutions, skin injuries or\nits attachments.\nUnder the General Health Law, a business that manufactures drugs is either required to obtain a “Sanitary Authorization” or to file an “Operating Notice.” Our Mexican\nsubsidiary, Oculus Technologies of Mexico, S.A. de C.V., is considered a business that manufactures medical devices and therefore is not subject to a Sanitary Authorization,\nbut rather only required to file an Operating Notice.\nIn addition to its Operating Notice, our Mexico subsidiary has obtained a “Good Processing Practices Certificate” issued by Mexican Federal Commission for the Protection\nagainst Sanitary Risks, which demonstrates that the manufacturing at our facility located in Zapopan, Mexico, operates in accordance with the applicable official standards.\nIn addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the United States, which could result in lengthy negotiations delaying our ability to\ncommercialize products. We face the risk that the prices which result from the regulatory approval process would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return.\nAvailable Information\nWe make available on sonomapharma.com, free of charge, copies of our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and\namendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing or furnishing such materials to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.\nSonomapharma.com and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this annual report on Form 10-K. The SEC maintains\nan Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.\n20\nITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses, we expect to continue to incur losses and we may never achieve profitability and our March 31, 2024 audited consolidated financial statements\nincluded disclosure that casts substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe reported a net loss of $4,835,000 and $5,151,000 for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At March 31, 2024 and 2023, our accumulated deficit\namounted to $194,349,000 and $189,514,000, respectively. We had working capital of $8,829,000 and $10,081,000 as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the\nyears ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in operating activities amounted to $2,398,000 and $6,152,000, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash\nequivalents of $3,128,000.\nWe spent the most recent years working to reduce our losses and have made significant progress. However, we expect to continue incurring losses for the foreseeable future. We\nmay never achieve or sustain profitability. We must raise additional capital to pursue our product development initiatives, penetrate markets for the sale of our products and\ncontinue as a going concern. We cannot provide any assurance that we will raise additional capital. We believe that we have access to capital resources through possible public\nor private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations, or other means. If we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to curtail our research\nand development initiatives and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve our cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations.\nThese measures could cause significant delays in our efforts to further commercialize our products, which are critical to the realization of our business plan and to our future\noperations. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern or become profitable.\nWe depend on third party distributors and intend to continue to license or collaborate with third parties in various potential markets, and events involving these strategic\npartners or any future collaboration could delay or prevent us from developing or commercializing products.\nOur business strategy and our short- and long-term operating results depend in part on our ability to execute on existing strategic collaborations and to license or partner with\nnew strategic partners. We believe collaborations allow us to leverage our resources and technologies and to access markets that are compatible with our own core areas of\nexpertise while avoiding the cost of establishing or maintaining a direct sales force in each market. We may incur significant costs in the use of third parties to identify and\nassist in establishing relationships with potential collaborators. We currently use distributors for most of our products.\nWe have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our current partners or any future collaborators devote to our collaborations or potential products. These\npartners may breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner. Further, our partners\nmay not develop or commercialize products that arise out of our collaborative arrangements or devote sufficient resources to the development, manufacture, marketing or sale\nof these products.\nTo penetrate our target markets, we may need to enter into additional collaborative agreements to assist in the development and commercialization of products. Establishing\nstrategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or intellectual\nproperty position and our internal capabilities. Our discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of new collaborations on favorable terms and may\nhave the potential to provide collaborators with access to our key intellectual property filings and next generation formations. By entering into collaboration, we may preclude\nopportunities to collaborate with other third parties who do not wish to associate with our existing third-party strategic partners. Moreover, in the event of termination of a\ncollaboration agreement, termination negotiations may result in less favorable terms.\n21\nMexican tax law prevents us from deducting intercompany interest expense incurred by our Mexico subsidiary Oculus Technologies of Mexico, S.A. de C.V and requires\nwithholding tax on payments remitted to the US. At the same time, we are unable to recognize tax benefits for foreign tax credits for U.S. tax purposes.\nSince 2004, we loaned substantial amounts to our Mexico subsidiary Oculus Technologies of Mexico, S.A. de C.V. at various interest rates to fund their operations. As of March\n31, 2024, our Mexico subsidiary owes approximately $13.4 million in principal, $9.8 million in technical assistance payments and $12.6 million in accrued interest. The\nintercompany loans mature in 2027. There is no guarantee that our Mexican subsidiary will be able to pay any or all of the amounts due. If we were to forgive the debt or if we\nwere to convert the debt to equity, it would be subject to Mexico income tax at 30%, or approximately $10.7 million, as well as Mexican withholding tax of 15%.\nMexico’s thin capitalization rules also require taxpayers to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of 3:1. Any interest paid to foreign related parties that results in indebtedness\nexceeding a ratio of 3:1 to their stockholder’s equity is not deductible for Mexican corporate income tax purposes and we did not meet that condition. Therefore, we have not\nbeen able to deduct the intercompany interest on our Mexico tax returns since 2004. It has prevented our Mexico subsidiary from accruing net operating losses in Mexico to\noffset potential future profits. At the same time the intercompany interest income in the United States decreases our U.S. net operating losses and reduces our ability to apply\nthese carryforwards to offset future taxable income in the United States.\nIn addition, any interest paid to a foreign lender is subject to Mexico withholding tax of 15%. We also have interest owed on our intercompany technical assistance agreement\nand royalty withholding of 10% on our technical assistance agreement. This would amount to approximately $4.7 million in Mexico withholding tax at March 31, 2024, if all of\nthe interest and technical assistance were to be repaid to us. In general, the foreign related party parent can then claim a credit for these withholding taxes on their U.S. income\ntax return. However, because of our substantial U.S. net operating losses, we are prevented from claiming any credit on any withholding tax for U.S. income tax purposes. Any\nsuch failure to pay intercompany debt, inability to deduct income taxes or apply credits, or liability for tax payments could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on a number of key customers who may not consistently purchase our products in the future and if we lose any one of these customers, our revenues may decline.\nAlthough we have a significant number of customers in each of the geographic markets that we operate in, we rely on certain key customers for a significant portion of our\nrevenues. For the year ended March 31, 2024, customer A represented 17%, customer B represented 15% and customer C represented 14% of net revenues. For the year ended\nMarch 31, 2023, customer A represented 11%, customer B represented 16% and customer C represented 18% of net revenues. In the future, a small number of customers may\ncontinue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in any given period. These customers may not consistently purchase our products at a particular rate over any\nsubsequent period. The loss of any of these customers could adversely affect our revenues.\nA majority of our business is conducted outside of the United States, exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the United States, which in turn could cause our\nbusiness and operating results to suffer.\nWe have material international operations in Mexico, Asia and Europe. During the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 76% and 74% of our total revenue,\nrespectively, were generated from sales outside of the United States. Our business is highly regulated for the use, marketing and manufacturing of our HOCl-based products\nboth domestically and internationally. Our international operations are subject to risks, including:\n· local political or economic instability;\n· continuing restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic;\n22\n· changes in exchange rates;\n· changes in governmental regulation;\n· changes in import/export duties;\n· trade restrictions;\n· lack of experience in foreign markets;\n· difficulties and costs of staffing and managing operations in certain foreign countries;\n· work stoppages or other changes in labor conditions;\n· difficulties in collecting accounts receivables on a timely basis, or at all; and\n· adverse tax consequences or overlapping tax structures.\nWe plan to continue to market and sell our products internationally to respond to customer requirements and market opportunities. We currently have manufacturing facilities in\nMexico. Establishing operations in any foreign country or region presents risks such as those described above as well as risks specific to the particular country or region. In\naddition, until a payment history is established over time with customers in a new geographic area or region, the likelihood of collecting receivables generated by such\noperations could be less than our expectations. As a result, there is a greater risk that the reserves set with respect to the collection of such receivables may be inadequate. If our\noperations in any foreign country are unsuccessful, we could incur significant losses and we may not achieve profitability.\nIn addition, changes in policies or laws of the United States or foreign governments resulting in, among other things, changes in regulations and the approval process, higher\ntaxation, currency conversion limitations, restrictions on fund transfers or the expropriation of private enterprises, could reduce the anticipated benefits of our international\nexpansion. If we fail to realize the anticipated revenue growth of our future international operations, our business and operating results could suffer.\nIf we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, additional regulatory clearances or approvals to market our current or future products, we may be unable\nto commercialize these products.\nThe developing, testing, manufacturing, marketing and selling of medical technology products is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the\nUnited States and other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory clearance and approval of medical technology products is costly and time consuming. Even though their\nunderlying product formulations may be the same or similar, our products are subject to different regulations and approval processes depending upon their intended use.\nThe FDA generally clears marketing of a medical device through the 510(k) pre-market clearance process if it is demonstrated the new product has the same intended use and\nthe same or similar technological characteristics as another legally marketed Class II device, such as a device already cleared by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket\nnotification process, and otherwise meets the FDA’s requirements. Product modifications, including labeling the product for a new intended use, may require the submission of\na new 510(k) clearance and FDA approval before the modified product can be marketed.\n23\nOn November 30, 2023, the FDA issued a proposed rule to classify certain wound dressings and liquid wound washes, including hypochlorous acid, into Class II medical\ndevices. If finalized, we would be required to submit new 510(k) applications for our products and to demonstrate compliance with special controls that require specific\ninformation relating to performance testing and technical specifications, specific labeling requirements, and other requirements. While we believe we will be able to\ndemonstrate compliance with these special controls if the proposed rule is finalized, there is no guarantee that the FDA will issue new clearance letters for our products, and the\nprocess of obtaining additional clearances may be costly and time consuming.\nIn addition, we do not know whether the necessary approvals or clearances will be granted or delayed for future products. The FDA could request additional information,\nchanges to product formulation(s) or clinical testing that could adversely affect the time to market and sale of products as drugs. If we do not obtain the requisite regulatory\nclearances and approvals, we will be unable to commercialize our products and may never recover any of the substantial costs we have invested in the development of HOCl.\nDistribution of our products outside the United States is subject to extensive government regulation. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance to\nmarket, the time required for regulatory review and the sanctions imposed for violations, vary from country to country. We do not know whether we will obtain regulatory\napprovals in such countries or that we will not be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining these regulatory approvals. In addition, the export by us of\ncertain of our products that have not yet been cleared for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to FDA export restrictions. Failure to obtain necessary regulatory\napprovals, the restriction, suspension or revocation of existing approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements would have a material adverse effect on\nour future business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or\nwithdrawal from the market.\nRegulatory approvals or clearances that we currently have and that we may receive in the future are subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be\nmarketed, and any future approvals could contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or\nactivities constitute promotion of an unapproved use or we otherwise fail to comply with FDA regulations, we may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions, including\nwarning letters, injunctions, seizures, civil fines or criminal penalties. In addition, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storing, advertising,\npromoting, distributing and record-keeping for approved products are subject to extensive regulation. We are subject to continued supervision by European regulatory agencies\nrelating to our CE markings and are required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities. Our manufacturing facilities, processes and specifications are\nsubject to periodic inspection by the FDA, Mexican and other regulatory authorities and, from time to time, we may receive notices of deficiencies from these agencies as a\nresult of such inspections. Our failure to continue to meet regulatory standards or to remedy any deficiencies could result in restrictions being imposed on our products or\nmanufacturing processes, fines, suspension or loss of regulatory approvals or clearances, product recalls, termination of distribution, product seizures or the need to invest\nsubstantial resources to comply with various existing and new requirements. In the more egregious cases, criminal sanctions, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits or closure\nof our manufacturing facilities are possible. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with HOCl, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or\nfrequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of our products, and could include voluntary or mandatory recall or withdrawal of products from the market.\nNew government regulations may be enacted and changes in FDA policies and regulations and, their interpretation and enforcement, could prevent or delay regulatory approval\nof our products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the\nUnited States or abroad. Therefore, we do not know whether we will be able to continue to comply with any regulations or that the costs of such compliance will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we will not be permitted to\nmarket our products and our business would suffer.\n24\nIf any of our third-party contractors fail to perform their responsibilities to comply with FDA rules and regulations, the manufacture, marketing and sales of our products\ncould be delayed, which could decrease our revenues.\nSupplying the market with our HOCl technology products requires us to manage relationships with an increasing number of collaborative partners, suppliers and third-party\ncontractors. As a result, our success depends partially on the success of these third parties in performing their responsibilities to comply with FDA rules and regulations.\nAlthough we pre-qualify our contractors and we believe that they are fully capable of performing their contractual obligations, we cannot directly control the adequacy and\ntimeliness of the resources and expertise that they apply to these activities. For example, we and our suppliers are required to comply with the FDA’s quality system regulations,\nwhich cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA\nenforces the quality system regulation through inspections.\nIf any of our partners or contractors fail to perform their obligations in an adequate and timely manner or fail to comply with the FDA’s rules and regulations, including failure\nto comply with quality systems regulations or a corrective action submitted to the FDA after notification by the FDA of a deficiency is deemed insufficient, then the\nmanufacture, marketing and sales of our products could be delayed. Our products could be detained or seized, the FDA could order a recall, or require our partner to replace or\noffer refunds for our products. The FDA could also require our partner, and depending on our agreement with our partner, us, to notify healthcare professionals and others that\nthe products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. If any of these events occur, the manufacture, marketing and sales of our products could be\ndelayed which could decrease our revenues.\nIf we fail to comply with the FDA’s rules and regulations and are subject to an FDA recall as part of an FDA enforcement action, the associated costs could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Company, our products, the manufacturing facilities for our products, the distribution of our products, and our promotion and marketing materials are subject to strict and\ncontinual review and periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory agencies for compliance with pre-approval and post-approval regulatory requirements.\nIf we fail to comply with the FDA’s rules and regulations, we could be subject to an enforcement action by the FDA. The FDA could undertake regulatory actions, including\nseeking a consent decree, recalling or seizing our products, ordering a total or partial shutdown of production, delaying future marketing clearances or approvals, and\nwithdrawing or suspending certain of our current products from the market. A product recall, restriction, or withdrawal could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures,\ndestruction of product inventory, and lost revenues due to the unavailability of one or more of our products for a period of time, which could reduce profitability and cash flow.\nIn addition, a product recall or withdrawal could divert significant management attention and financial resources. If any of our products are subject to an FDA recall, we could\nincur significant costs and suffer economic losses. Production of our products could be suspended and we could be required to establish inventory reserves to cover estimated\ninventory losses for all work-in-process and finished goods related to products we, or our third-party contractors, manufacture. A recall of a material amount of our products\ncould have a significant, unfavorable impact on our future gross margins.\nIf our products fail to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations, or our products are deemed defective, we may be required to recall our products and we could\nsuffer adverse public relations that could adversely impact our sales, operating results, and reputation which would adversely affect our business operations.\nWe may be exposed to product recalls, including voluntary recalls or withdrawals, and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to cause injury or illness, or if we are\nalleged to have mislabeled or misbranded our products or otherwise violated governmental regulations. Governmental authorities can also require product recalls or impose\nrestrictions for product design, manufacturing, labeling, clearance, or other issues. For the same reasons, we may also voluntarily elect to recall, restrict the use of a product or\nwithdraw products that we consider below our standards, whether for quality, packaging, appearance or otherwise, in order to protect our brand reputation.\nProduct recalls, product liability claims, even if unmerited or unsuccessful, or any other events that cause consumers to no longer associate our brand with high quality and safe\nproducts may also result in adverse publicity, hurt the value of our brand, harm our reputation among our customers and other healthcare professionals who use or recommend\nthe products, lead to a decline in consumer confidence in and demand for our products, and lead to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies of our operations,\nany of which could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, performance, prospects, value, results of operations and financial condition.\n25\nIf our products do not gain market acceptance, our business will suffer because we might not be able to fund future operations.\nA number of factors may affect the market acceptance of our products or any other products we develop or acquire, including, among others:\n· the price of our products relative to other products for the same or similar treatments;\n· the perception by patients, physicians and other members of the healthcare community of the effectiveness and safety of our products for their indicated applications and\ntreatments;\n· changes in practice guidelines and the standard of care for the targeted indication;\n· our ability to fund our sales and marketing efforts; and\n· the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts or our partners’ sales and marketing efforts.\nOur ability to effectively promote and sell any approved products will also depend on pricing and cost-effectiveness, including our ability to produce a product at a competitive\nprice and our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement, if any. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community on the benefits of our product\ncandidates may require significant resources, may be constrained by FDA rules and policies on product promotion, and may never be successful. If our products do not gain\nmarket acceptance, we may not be able to fund future operations, including developing, testing and obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates and expanding\nour sales and marketing efforts for our approved products, which would cause our business to suffer.\nIf our competitors develop products with similar characteristics to HOCl, we may need to modify or alter our business strategy, which may delay the achievement of our\ngoals.\nCompetitors have and may continue to develop products with similar characteristics to HOCl. Such similar products marketed by larger competitors can hinder our or our\npartners’ efforts to penetrate the market. As a result, we may be forced to modify or alter our business and regulatory strategy and sales and marketing plans, as a response to\nchanges in the market, competition and technology limitations, among others. Such modifications may pose additional delays in achieving our goals.\nNegative economic conditions increase the risk that we could suffer unrecoverable losses on our customers’ accounts receivable which would adversely affect our financial\nresults.\nWe grant credit to our business customers, which are primarily located in Mexico, Europe and the United States. Collateral is generally not required for trade receivables. We\nmaintain allowances for potential credit losses. We rely on certain key customers for a significant portion of revenues. At March 31, 2024, customer B represented 13% of our\nnet accounts receivable balance and customer D represented 17% of our net accounts receivable balance. At March 31, 2023, customer B represented 22% of our net accounts\nreceivable balance and customer D represented 21% of our net accounts receivable balance. While we believe we have a varied customer base and have experienced strong\ncollections in the past, if current economic conditions disproportionately impact any one of our key customers, including reductions in their purchasing commitments to us or\ntheir ability to pay their obligations, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and liquidity. We have not purchased insurance on our accounts receivable balances.\n26\nWe may experience difficulties in manufacturing our products, which could prevent us from commercializing one or more of our products.\nThe machines used to manufacture our products are complex, use complicated software and must be monitored by highly trained engineers. Slight deviations anywhere in our\nmanufacturing process, including quality control, labeling, and packaging, could lead to a failure to meet the specifications required by the FDA, the Environmental Protection\nAgency, European notified bodies, Mexican regulatory agencies and other foreign regulatory bodies, which may result in lot failures or product recalls. If we are unable to\nobtain quality internal and external components, mechanical and electrical parts, if our software contains defects or is corrupted, or if we are unable to attract and retain\nqualified technicians to manufacture our products, our manufacturing output of HOCl, or any other product candidate based on our platform that we may develop, could fail to\nmeet required standards, our regulatory approvals could be delayed, denied or revoked, and commercialization of one or more of our products may be delayed or foregone.\nManufacturing processes that are used to produce the smaller quantities of HOCl-based products needed for clinical tests and current commercial sales may not be successfully\nscaled up to allow production of significant commercial quantities. Any failure to manufacture our products to required standards on a commercial scale could result in reduced\nrevenues, delays in generating revenue and increased costs.\nOur competitive position depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies.\nOur ability to compete and to achieve and maintain profitability depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. We currently rely on a\ncombination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, license agreements and invention assignment agreements to protect our\nintellectual property rights. We also rely upon unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. These\nmeasures may not be adequate to safeguard our HOCl technology. If we do not protect our rights adequately, third parties could use our technology, and our ability to compete\nin the market would be reduced.\nOur pending patent applications and any patent applications we may file in the future may not result in issued patents, and we do not know whether any of our in-licensed\npatents or any additional patents that might ultimately be issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or foreign regulatory body will protect our HOCl technology. Any\nclaims that are issued may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing substitutes and may be infringed, designed around, or invalidated by\nthird parties. Even issued patents may later be found to be invalid or may be modified or revoked in proceedings instituted by third parties before various patent offices or in\ncourts. For example, our European patent that was initially issued on May 30, 2007 was revoked by the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office in December 2009\nfollowing opposition proceedings instituted by a competitor.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is more uncertain in part because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights,\nand we will not be able to ensure that:\n· we were the first to invent the inventions described in patent applications;\n· we were the first to file patent applications for inventions;\n· others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our products without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n· any patents licensed or issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantages;\n· we will develop proprietary technologies that are patentable; or\n· the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business.\n27\nThe policies we use to protect our trade secrets may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our trade secrets by others. In addition, confidentiality and invention\nassignment agreements executed by our employees, consultants and advisors may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other\nproprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosures.\nWe cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation and use of our intellectual property in the United States, or in foreign countries where the\nlaws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.\nWe may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming, costly to defend and could result in our loss of significant rights and, in the case of\npatent infringement claims, the assessment of treble damages.\nOn occasion, we may receive notices of claims of infringement, misappropriation, or misuse of other parties’ proprietary rights. We may have disputes regarding intellectual\nproperty rights with the parties that have licensed those rights to us. We may also initiate claims to defend our intellectual property. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of\nits outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert management’s attention from our business and have a material negative effect on our business, operating\nresults, or financial condition. In addition, the outcome of such litigation may be unpredictable. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to\npay substantial damages, including treble damages if we were to be found to have willfully infringed a third party’s patent, to the party claiming infringement, develop non-\ninfringing technology, stop selling our products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property or enter into royalty or license agreements that\nmay not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all. Our failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely\nbasis could harm our business. In addition, modifying our products to exclude infringing technologies could require us to seek re-approval or clearance from various regulatory\nbodies for our products, which would be costly and time consuming. Also, we may be unaware of pending patent applications that relate to our technology. Parties making\ninfringement claims on future issued patents may be able to obtain an injunction that would prevent us from selling our products or using technology that contains the allegedly\ninfringing intellectual property, which could harm our business.\nWe could be required to indemnify third parties for alleged intellectual property infringement, which could cause us to incur significant costs.\nSome of our distribution agreements contain commitments to indemnify our distributors against liability arising from infringement of third-party intellectual property, such as\npatents. We may be required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them or to contribute to license fees they are required to pay. If we are forced to indemnify for\nclaims or to pay license fees, our business and financial condition could be substantially harmed.\nOur international operations are subject to trade policies and trade agreements and unfavorable changes could harm our business.\nWe have significant international operations in Mexico and Europe, and we manufacture products for export in Mexico. There may be changes to existing trade agreements, like\nthe USMCA, which went to effect on July 1, 2020, greater restrictions on free trade generally, and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States,\nparticularly tariffs on products manufactured in Mexico, among other possible changes. Any changes to USMCA (or subsequent trade agreements) could impact our operations\nin countries where we manufacture or sell products or source components, or materials, which could adversely affect our operating results and our business.\n28\nOur sales in international markets subject us to foreign currency exchange and other risks and costs which could harm our business.\nA substantial portion of our revenues are derived from outside the United States, primarily from Mexico and Europe. We anticipate that revenues from international customers\nwill continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Because we generate revenues in foreign currencies, we are subject to the effects of\nexchange rate fluctuations. The functional currency of our Mexican subsidiary is the Mexican Peso and the functional currency of our Netherlands subsidiary is the Euro. For\nthe preparation of our consolidated financial statements, the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates during the\napplicable period. If the U.S. dollar appreciates against the Mexican Peso or the Euro, as applicable, the revenues we recognize from sales by our subsidiaries will be adversely\nimpacted. Foreign exchange gains or losses as a result of exchange rate fluctuations in any given period could harm our operating results and negatively impact our revenues.\nAdditionally, if the effective price of our products were to increase as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, demand for our products could decline and\nadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If our competitors are better able to develop and market products that\nare less expensive or more effective than any products that we may develop, our commercial opportunity may be reduced or eliminated.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to stay at the forefront of technological change and to maintain a competitive position. We compete with large healthcare,\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, along with smaller or early-stage companies that have collaborative arrangements with larger pharmaceutical companies,\nacademic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and\nexpertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we\ndo. Our competitors may:\n· develop and patent processes or products earlier than we will;\n· develop and commercialize products that are less expensive or more efficient than any products that we may develop;\n· obtain regulatory approvals for competing products more rapidly than we will; and\n· improve upon existing technological approaches or develop new or different approaches that render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive.\nAs a result, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any future products.\nThe success of our research and development efforts may depend on our ability to find suitable collaborators to fully exploit our capabilities. If we are unable to establish\ncollaborations or if these future collaborations are unsuccessful, our research and development efforts may be unsuccessful, which could adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nAn element of our business strategy is to enter into collaborative or license arrangements under which we license our HOCl technology to other parties for development and\ncommercialization. We expect to seek collaborators for our potential products because of the expense, effort and expertise required to conduct clinical trials and further develop\nthose potential product candidates. Because collaboration arrangements are complex to negotiate, we may not be successful in our attempts to establish these arrangements. If\nwe need third party assistance in identifying and negotiating one or more acceptable arrangements, it might be costly. Also, we may not have products that are desirable to other\nparties, or we may be unwilling to license a potential product because the party interested in it is a competitor. The terms of any arrangements that we establish may not be\nfavorable to us. Alternatively, potential collaborators may decide against entering into an agreement with us because of our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position\nor for scientific, commercial or other reasons. If we are unable to establish collaborative agreements, we may not be able to develop and commercialize new products, which\nwould adversely affect our business and our revenues.\n29\nIn order for any of these collaboration or license arrangements to be successful, we must first identify potential collaborators or licensees whose capabilities complement and\nintegrate well with ours. We may rely on these arrangements for not only financial resources, but also for expertise or economies of scale that we expect to need in the future\nrelating to clinical trials, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and for licensing technology rights. However, it is likely that we will not be able to control the amount and timing\nof resources that our collaborators or licensees devote to our programs or potential products. If our collaborators or licensees prove difficult to work with, are less skilled than\nwe originally expected, or do not devote adequate resources to the program, the relationship will not be successful. If a business combination involving a collaborator or\nlicensee and a third party were to occur, the effect could be to diminish, terminate or cause delays in development of a potential product.\nIf we are unable to comply with broad and complex federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including state and federal anti-kickback laws, we could face substantial\npenalties and our products could be excluded from government healthcare programs.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, which include, among other things, “anti-kickback” laws that prohibit payments to\ninduce the referral of products and services, and “false claims” statutes that prohibit the fraudulent billing of federal healthcare programs. Our operations are subject to the\nFederal Anti-Kickback Statute, a criminal statute that, subject to certain statutory exceptions, prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or\nreceiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward a person either (i) for referring an individual for the furnishing of items or services for which payment may be\nmade in whole or in part by a government healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid, or (ii) for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the\npurchasing, leasing or ordering of an item or service for which payment may be made under a government healthcare program. Because of the breadth of the Federal Anti-\nKickback Statute, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was authorized to adopt regulations setting forth additional exceptions\nto the prohibitions of the statute commonly known as “safe harbors.” If all of the elements of an applicable safe harbor are fully satisfied, an arrangement will not be subject to\nprosecution under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute.\nIn addition, if there is a change in law, regulation or administrative or judicial interpretations of these laws, we may have to change our business practices or our existing\nbusiness practices could be challenged as unlawful, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse laws are complex, and even minor, inadvertent irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that a statute or regulation has been violated. The\nfrequency of suits to enforce these laws has increased significantly in recent years and has increased the risk that a healthcare company will have to defend a false claim action,\npay fines or be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid or other federal and state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action. We cannot\nguarantee that we will not become subject to such litigation. Any violations of these laws, or any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend\nagainst it, could harm our reputation, be costly to defend and divert management’s attention from other aspects of our business. Similarly, if the physicians or other providers or\nentities with which we do business are found to have violated abuse laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on us.\nWe may not be able to maintain sufficient product liability insurance to cover claims against us.\nProduct liability insurance for the healthcare industry is generally expensive to the extent it is available at all. We may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable\nterms or be able to secure increased coverage if the commercialization of our products progresses, nor can we be sure that existing or future claims against us will be covered\nby our product liability insurance. Moreover, the existing coverage of our insurance policy or any rights of indemnification and contribution that we may have may not be\nsufficient to offset existing or future claims. A successful claim against us with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of insurance coverage and not subject to any\nindemnification or contribution could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n30\nOur ability to generate revenue will be diminished if our partners are unable to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement from third-party payors, or\nour partners may face pricing pressure from private third-party payers, including customers, from rebates and restrictive reimbursement practices.\nOur partner’s ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for the cost of our\nproducts and related treatment are obtained from governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations, or HMOs.\nIn the United States, governmental and private payors have limited the growth of health care costs through price regulation or controls, competitive pricing programs and drug\nrebate programs.\nThere is significant uncertainty concerning third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved medical products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the\nprices charged for medical products and services. Also, the trend toward managed healthcare in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as HMOs, as\nwell as the “Affordable Care Act,” or any new healthcare laws may result in lower prices for or rejection of our products. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors\nand providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform or changes to managed healthcare could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect\nour partner’s abilities to sell our products profitably, and thus lead to decreased demand for our products and revenues for us. We were able to negotiate minimum purchase\nrequirements in certain of our third-party distributor agreements. However, we have limited control over purchases by our distributors, to meet the minimum purchase\nthresholds or above the minimum purchase thresholds.\nIncreasingly, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been raising co-payments required from beneficiaries and looking for other ways to shift\nmore of the cost burden to manufacturers and patients. This cost shifting has given consumers greater control of medication choices, as they pay for a larger portion of their\nprescription costs and may cause consumers to favor lower cost generic alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals. Additionally, patients continue to face cost reduction pressures\nthat may cause them to curtail their use of, or seek reimbursement for, our products, to negotiate reduced fees or other concessions or to delay payment. Third-party payors may\nreduce or limit reimbursement for our products in the future, such as by withdrawing their coverage policies, canceling any future contracts, reviewing and adjusting the rate of\nreimbursement, or imposing limitations on coverage. Any such changes could negatively impact the sales of our products by our partners, and therefore, have a material adverse\neffect on our revenues.\nOur ability to generate revenue will be diminished if our partners are unable to manage customer product substitutions for our prescription products.\nSimilar to other pharmaceutical companies, patients are increasingly seeking lower-cost substitutes to our products. Even if our patients have a prescription for our product, the\npharmacist may recommend a less expensive product even if that product is less effective or designed for conditions different from what the patient is seeking to treat. As a\nresult, the patient may choose to abandon purchasing our prescribed product for a less expensive alternative product resulting in a lost sale for our partners. If the number of\nconsumers substituting our products increases, it could have a material adverse effect on sales of our products by our partners, and therefore, our revenues, financial position,\ncash flows and results of operations.\nOur inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the future may cause us to curtail certain operational activities, including regulatory trials, sales and\nmarketing, and international operations, in order to reduce costs and sustain the business, and such inability would have a material adverse effect on our business and\nfinancial condition.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future in order to, among other things:\n· increase our sales and marketing efforts to drive market adoption and address competitive developments;\n· sustain commercialization of our current products or new products;\n31\n· acquire or license technologies;\n· develop new products;\n· expand our manufacturing capabilities; and\n· finance capital expenditures and our general and administrative expenses.\nOur present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n· the level of research and development investment required to maintain and improve our technology position;\n· cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n· our efforts to acquire or license complementary technologies or acquire complementary businesses;\n· changes in product development plans needed to address any difficulties in commercialization;\n· competing technological and market developments; and\n· changes in regulatory policies or laws that affect our operations.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, it will result in dilution to our stockholders. Any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or\nprivileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and\nprivileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise\nadditional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or products, or grant licenses on\nterms that are not favorable to us. A failure to obtain adequate funds may cause us to curtail certain operational activities, including regulatory trials, sales and marketing, and\ninternational operations, in order to reduce costs and sustain our business, and would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur information technology and infrastructure may be breached or attacked, which could expose us to liability, damage our reputation, compromise our confidential\ninformation or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store a limited amount of sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of\nour customers, suppliers, business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure\nprocessing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and\ninfrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks\nand the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or\nproceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, and\ndamage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.\n32\nOur cash and cash equivalents may be exposed to failure of our banking institutions.\nWe maintain our cash at financial institutions, in balances that exceed current FDIC insurance limits. If the banks where we hold deposits were to become insolvent or enter\nreceivership, our ability to access our cash, cash equivalents and investments, including transferring funds, making payments or receiving funds, may be threatened, and this\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline significantly.\nThe trading price for our common stock has been, and we expect it to continue to be, volatile. The price at which our common stock trades depends upon a number of factors,\nincluding our historical and anticipated operating results, our financial situation, announcements of new products by us or our competitors, our ability or inability to raise the\nadditional capital we may need and the terms on which we raise it, and general market and economic conditions. Some of these factors are beyond our control. Broad market\nfluctuations may lower the market price of our common stock and affect the volume of trading in our stock, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business\nor prospects. It is impossible to assure you that the market price of our shares of common stock will not fall in the future.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to decrease.\nFluctuations in our operating results may lead to fluctuations, including declines, in our share price. Our operating results and our share price may fluctuate from period to\nperiod due to a variety of factors, including:\n· demand by physicians, other medical staff and patients for our HOCl-based products;\n· clinical trial results published by others in our industry and publication of results in peer-reviewed journals or the presentation at medical conferences;\n· the inclusion or exclusion of our HOCl-based products in large clinical trials conducted by others;\n· actual and anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n· developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n· issues in manufacturing our product candidates or products;\n· new or less expensive products and services or new technology introduced or offered by our competitors or by us;\n· reimbursement decisions by third-party payors and announcements of those decisions;\n· the development and commercialization of product enhancements;\n· changes in the regulatory environment;\n33\n· delays in establishing new strategic relationships;\n· costs associated with collaborations and new product candidates;\n· introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n· litigation or public concern about the safety of our product candidates or products;\n· changes in recommendations of securities analysts or lack of analyst coverage;\n· failure to meet analyst expectations regarding our operating results;\n· additions or departures of key personnel; and\n· general market conditions.\nVariations in the timing of our future revenues and expenses could also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from period to period and may result in\nunanticipated earning shortfalls or losses. In addition, The Nasdaq Capital Market, in general, and the market for life sciences companies, in particular, have experienced\nsignificant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law may make it more difficult for stockholders to change our management\nand may also make a takeover difficult.\nOur corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to change our management and may also enable our management to resist a\ntakeover. These provisions include:\n· the ability of our Board of Directors to issue and designate, without stockholder approval, the rights of up to 714,286 shares of convertible preferred stock, which rights\ncould be senior to those of common stock;\n· limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n· advance notice procedures required for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before meetings of stockholders.\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits “business combinations” between a publicly-held\nDelaware corporation and an “interested stockholder,” which is generally defined as a stockholder who became a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation’s\nvoting stock for a three-year period following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder.\nThese provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control in our management. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult\nfor you and other stockholders to elect directors and cause us to take other corporate actions. In addition, the existence of these provisions, together with Delaware law, might\nhinder or delay an attempted takeover other than through negotiations with our Board of Directors.\n34\nOur stockholders may experience substantial dilution in the value of their investment if we issue additional shares of our capital stock or other securities convertible into\ncommon stock.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, allows us to issue up to 24,000,000 shares of our common stock and to issue and designate, without stockholder\napproval, the rights of up to 714,286 shares of preferred stock. In the event we issue additional shares of our capital stock, dilution to our stockholders could result. In addition,\nif we issue and designate a class of convertible preferred stock, these securities may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nAdditionally, if we issue preferred stock, it may convert into common stock at a ratio of 1:1 or greater because our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, allows us\nto designate a conversion ratio without limitations.\nShares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options may substantially increase the number of shares available for sale in the public market and depress the price of\nour common stock.\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 1,032,999 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $2.42 per share\nand a weighted average contractual term of 8.91 years. In addition, 125,556 shares of our common stock were available on March 31, 2024 for future option grants under our\n2016 Equity Incentive Plan and our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan. To the extent any additional options are granted and exercised, there will be further dilution to stockholders and\ninvestors. Until the options expire, these holders will have an opportunity to profit from any increase in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risks of\nownership. Holders of options may convert or exercise these securities at a time when we could obtain additional capital on terms more favorable than those provided by the\noptions. The exercise of the options will dilute the voting interest of the owners of presently outstanding shares by adding a substantial number of additional shares of our\ncommon stock.\nWe have filed several registration statements with the SEC, so that substantially all of the shares of our common stock which are issuable upon the exercise of outstanding\nwarrants and options may be sold in the public market. The sale of our common stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of the warrants and options described above, or the\nperception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur failure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our common stock.\nOn September 22, 2023, we received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) indicating that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2),\nwhich requires companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share for continued listing. On March 21, 2024, we received a notice\nthat Nasdaq had granted us an additional 180 calendar days, or until September 16, 2024, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement for continued\nlisting. Nasdaq’s letter has no immediate impact on the listing of our common stock, which will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq, subject to our compliance with the\nother continued listing requirements. We may regain compliance at any time during this compliance period if the minimum bid price for our common stock is at least $1 for a\nminimum of ten consecutive business days.\nUntil Nasdaq has reached a final determination that we have regained compliance with all of the applicable continued listing requirements, there can be no assurances regarding\nthe continued listing of our common stock or warrants on Nasdaq. The delisting of our common stock and warrants from Nasdaq would have a material adverse effect on our\naccess to capital markets, and any limitation on market liquidity or reduction in the price of its common stock as a result of that delisting would adversely affect our ability to\nraise capital on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.\n35\nITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot Applicable.\nITEM 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe identify and address cybersecurity threats and risks related to our business with an approach that includes assessments by our management and use of an outside consultant\nto manage our information technology. In addition, we rely on operating systems and software from established and reliable third-party service providers to provide security.\nWe have employee policies in place designed to reduce risk of cyber-attacks and educate employees on protocol in the event of a potential cybersecurity incident.\nCurrently we are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected our business\nstrategy, results of operations or financial condition or are reasonably likely to have such a material effect. However, cyber-attacks are increasing in frequency, sophistication\nand intensity, and despite our ongoing efforts we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or provide assurances that we have not experienced undetected\ncybersecurity incidents. Please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for more information on the risks posed to us by cybersecurity threats.\nGovernance\nThe Board of Directors takes an active role, as a whole, in overseeing management regarding our Company’s risks, including cybersecurity risks. Our management, including\nour Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, keeps the Board of Directors apprised of significant risks facing our Company and the approach being taken to\nunderstand, manage, and mitigate such risks, including with respect to potential cybersecurity threats.\nITEM 2. Properties\nAt March 31, 2024, we have a corporate office in Boulder, Colorado and our manufacturing facility in Zapopan, Mexico. We currently lease the following material properties:\nLocation Rent per month Purpose\n5445 Conestoga Court, Unit 150, Boulder, CO 80301 USD 3,573 Principal executive office\nIndustria Vidriera 81, & 87 Zapopan Industrial Norte, Zapopan, Jalisco, 45135, Mexico MXN 209,811 Office, manufacturing\nIndustria Maderera 124, 106, 115 & 815 Zapopan Industrial Norte, Zapopan, Jalisco, 45135, Mexico MXN 213,625 Warehouse\nWe believe that our properties will be adequate to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months.\nITEM 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe may be involved in legal matters arising in the ordinary course of our business including matters involving proprietary technology. While management believes that such\nmatters are currently insignificant, matters arising in the ordinary course of business for which we are or could become involved in litigation may have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition or results of comprehensive (loss) income.\nITEM 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\n36\nPART II\nITEM 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “SNOA.” Previously, it traded under the symbol “OCLS” until December 6, 2016. Our common\nstock has been trading since our initial public offering on January 25, 2007.\nHolders\nAs of June 12, 2024, we had approximately 291 holders of record of our common stock. Holders of record include nominees who may hold shares on behalf of multiple\nowners.\nDividends\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings for the operation of our business and we\ndo not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nThe information required to be disclosed by Item 201(d) of Regulation S-K, “Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans,” is incorporated herein by\nreference. Refer to Item 12 of Part III of this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nWe did not issue any unregistered securities during the year ended March 31, 2024 and through June 17, 2024.\nITEM 6. Selected Financial Data\nAs a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations\nand therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item.\n37\nITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to\nexercise its judgment. We exercise considerable judgment with respect to establishing sound accounting policies and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of our assets and liabilities, our recognition of revenues and expenses, and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. Areas in which we exercise significant judgment include, but are not necessarily limited to, our valuation of\naccounts receivable, inventory, income taxes, equity transactions (compensatory and financing) and contingencies.\nWe base our estimates and judgments on a variety of factors including our historical experience, knowledge of our business and industry, current and expected economic\nconditions, the attributes of our products, the regulatory environment, and in certain cases, the results of outside appraisals. We periodically re-evaluate our estimates and\nassumptions with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications are necessary.\nWhile we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies, we cannot guarantee that the results\nwill always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results could differ from such estimates.\nFor a Summary of all Accounting Policies, please refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3.\nResults of Continuing Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nRevenue\nThe following table shows our consolidated total revenue and revenue by geographic region for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:\nYear Ended\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nUnited States $ 3,058 $ 3,428 $ (370) (11%)\nEurope 4,781 4,051 730 18%\nAsia 2,298 2,451 (153) (6%)\nLatin America 1,726 2,383 (657) (28%)\nRest of the World 872 959 (87) (9%)\nTotal $ 12,735 $ 13,272 $ (537) (4%)\n38\nThe decrease in United States revenue of $370,000 for the year ended March 31, 2024, was primarily the result of fluctuations in over-the-counter animal health care sales.\nThe increase in Europe revenue for the year ended March 31, 2024 of $730,000 was the result of a general increase in demand for our products and, more specifically, an\nincrease in demand for our wound care products from our customer in Poland due to recent world events.\nThe decrease in Asia revenue of $153,000 for the year ended March 31, 2024, was primarily due to timing of orders. Revenues from our international distributors tend to\nfluctuate from period to period due to customer placement of larger but less frequent orders to benefit from quantity discounts and reduced shipping costs.\nThe decrease in Latin America revenue for the year ended March 31, 2024 of $657,000 was primarily due to a one-time event in the prior year related to the sale of machinery\nto a customer. We recorded $750,000 of service revenue in the prior year in connection with this transaction.\nThe decrease in Rest of World revenue for the year ended March 31, 2024 of $87,000 was primarily due to timing of customer orders.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nThe cost of revenue and gross profit metrics for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\nYear Ended\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands, except for percentages) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nCost of Revenues $ 7,990 $ 8,795 $ (805) (9%)\nCost of Revenue as a % of Revenues 63% 66%\nGross Profit $ 4,745 $ 4,477 $ 268 6%\nGross Profit as a % of Revenues 37% 34%\nThe increase in gross profit margin of $268,000 for the year ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to overall product mix, redeployment of\nlabor to research and development projects in the current year and higher costs of materials and transportation in the prior year.\nResearch and Development Expense\nThe research and development expense metrics for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\nYear Ended\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands, except for percentages) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nResearch and Development Expense $ 1,871 $ 207 $ 1,664 804%\nResearch and Development Expense as a % of Revenues 15% 2%\nIncreases in research and development expenses for the year ended March 31, 2024 of $1,664,000 was primarily due to increased product development and expanded\nregulatory efforts in the U.S. and Europe to support new product releases.\n39\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nThe selling, general and administrative expense metrics for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\nYear Ended\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands, except for percentages) 2024 2023 Change % Change\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense $ 7,575 $ 8,840 $ (1,265) (14%)\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense as a % of Revenues 59% 67%\nThe decline in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2024 of $1,265,000 was the result of ongoing efforts to contain expenses across all\nparts of the company.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net for the year ended March 31, 2024 was $330,000 compared to $614,000 for the year ended March 31, 2023. The changes in other expense, net primarily\nrelate to exchange rate fluctuations.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $196,000 and $33,000, respectively. The increase is primarily related to the release of our valuation\nallowance on deferred tax assets in Europe.\nNet Loss\nThe following table provides the net loss for each period along with the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share:\nFor the Year Ended March 31,\n(In thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (4,835) $ (5,151)\nWeighted-average shares outstanding: basic and diluted 9,090 3,394\nNet loss per share: basic and diluted $ (0.53) $ (1.52)\n40\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe reported a net loss of $4,835,000 and $5,151,000 for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At March 31, 2024 and 2023, our accumulated deficit\namounted to $194,349,000 and $189,514,000, respectively. As of March 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3,128,000 and $3,820,000, respectively.\nSince our inception, substantially all of our operations have been financed through sales of equity securities. Other sources of financing that we have used to date include our\nrevenues, as well as various loans and the sale of certain assets to customers.\nSince April 1, 2023, substantially all of our operations have been financed through cash on hand and the following transactions:\n· Proceeds of $1,446,000, net of offering expenses, from the sale of common stock on October 26, 2023.\n· Proceeds of $343,000, net of offering expenses, from the sale of common stock on January 11, 2024.\nThe following table presents a summary of our consolidated cash flows for operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 as well\nbalances of cash and cash equivalents and working capital:\nYear ended March 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ (2,398) $ (6,152)\nInvesting activities (2) (258)\nFinancing activities 1,676 2,489\nEffect of exchange rates on cash 32 345\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents (692) (3,576)\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of the period 3,820 7,396\nCash and cash equivalents, end of the period $ 3,128 $ 3,820\nWorking capital (1), end of period $ 8,829 $ 10,081\n(1) Defined as current assets minus current liabilities.\nAs of March 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3,128,000 and $3,820,000, respectively.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2024 was $2,398,000, primarily due to our net loss of $4,835,000, offset by stock compensation of\n$516,000, a decrease in inventory of $184,000, and a decrease in prepaid expenses of $1,107,000.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2023 was $6,152,000, primarily due to net loss of $5,151,000 and a decline in deferred revenue.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2024 was $2,000, primarily related to the purchase of capital property and equipment.\n41\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2023 was $258,000, primarily related to the purchase of capital property and equipment.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2024 was $1,676,000 primarily related to proceeds of $1,784,000 from the sale of common stock.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2023 was $2,489,000 primarily related to proceeds of $2,868,000 from the sale of common stock,\nproceeds of $515,000 from short-term notes, offset by payments on our PPP loan and short-term notes.\nWe expect revenues to fluctuate and may incur losses in the foreseeable future and may need to raise additional capital to pursue our product development initiatives, to\npenetrate markets for the sale of our products and continue as a going concern. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital.\nManagement believes that we have access to capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or other means;\nhowever, we cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If the economic climate in the U.S. deteriorates, our\nability to raise additional capital could be negatively impacted. If we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to reduce costs in\norder to conserve our cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. These measures could cause significant delays in our continued efforts to\ncommercialize our products, which is critical to the realization of our business plan and our future operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue\nas a going concern.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe currently forecast capital expenditures in order to execute on our business plan and maintain growth; however, the actual amount and timing of such capital expenditures\nwill ultimately be determined by the volume of business. We currently do not anticipate that a material amount will be purchased for the year ended March 31, 2025. If we\npurchase capital equipment, we expect to pay cash for those expenditures or to finance them through equipment leases.\nMaterial Trends and Uncertainties\nWe rely on certain key customers for a significant portion of our revenues. In the future, a small number of customers may continue to represent a significant portion of our\ntotal revenues in any given period. These customers may not consistently purchase our products at a particular rate over any subsequent period.\nWe are exposed to risk from decline in foreign currency for both the Euro and the Mexico Peso versus the US dollar. Most recently there has been a sharp decline in the Euro\nversus the U.S. Dollar which has impacted our financial results.\nWe face a substantial Mexico tax liability, intercompany debt, unpaid technical assistance charges and accrued interest. These amounts are due in 2027. At this time,\nmanagement believes there are sufficient assets on the balance sheet to more than cover any tax obligation without interrupting the Company’s operations or business. We have\nengaged tax professionals to review all options to limit our exposure to these amounts and to proceed in a manner that is most advantageous to the Company.\nThe effects of the recent pandemic continue to impact economies worldwide, and we are closely watching inflation, increased volatility within financial markets, shipping costs,\nsupply chain issues and labor costs. Any impact to our business operations, customer demand and supply chain due to increased shipping costs may ultimately impact sales. We\ncontinue to evaluate our end-to-end supply chain and assess opportunities to refine the impact on sales. Currently, most of our customers pay for shipping expenses, including\nincreased shipping costs, if any. We have not yet faced labor shortages however it is possible we may have difficulties retaining and finding qualified employees in a tight labor\nmarket in the future. Furthermore, overall inflation tendencies may put pressure on our product pricing and/or costs.\nWe also closely monitor overall economic conditions and consumer sentiment and the prospect of a recession in the United States which may impact our financial results.\n42\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions include\nreserves and write-downs related to receivables and inventories, the recoverability of long-lived assets, the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets, valuation of\nequity and derivative instruments, debt discounts, valuation of investments and the estimated amortization periods of upfront product licensing fees received from customers.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nWe currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in\nfinancial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nAs a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations\nand therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item.\nITEM 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nSonoma Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB No. 215) F-1\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2024 and 2023 F-2\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss for the Years Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 F-3\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity for the Years Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 F-4\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 F-5\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements F-6\n43\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of\nSonoma Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sonoma Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, and the\nrelated consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nSubstantial Doubt About the Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and\nsustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described\nin Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to\nperform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but\nnot for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of\nthe consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,\nor complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Frazier & Deeter, LLC\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2021.\nTampa, Florida\nJune 17, 2024\nF-1\nSONOMA PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 – Organization and Recent Developments\nOrganization\nSonoma Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of California in April 1999 and was reincorporated under the laws of the State of\nDelaware in December 2006. The Company moved its principal office from Petaluma, California to Woodstock, Georgia in June 2020 and to Boulder, Colorado in October\n2022. The Company is a global healthcare leader for developing and producing stabilized hypochlorous acid (“HOCl”) products for a wide range of applications, including\nwound care, eye, oral and nasal care, dermatological conditions, podiatry, animal health care, and as a non-toxic disinfectant. The Company’s products are clinically proven to\nreduce itch, pain, scarring, and irritation safely and without damaging healthy tissue. In-vitro and clinical studies of HOCl show it to safely manage skin abrasions, lacerations,\nminor irritations, cuts, and intact skin. The Company sells its products either directly or via partners in 55 countries worldwide.\nNOTE 2 – Liquidity and Financial Condition\nThe Company reported a net loss of $4,835,000 and $5,151,000 for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s\naccumulated deficit amounted to $194,349,000 and $189,514,000, respectively. The Company had working capital of $8,829,000 and $10,081,000 as of March 31, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. During the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in operating activities amounted to $2,398,000 and $6,152,000, respectively.\nManagement believes that the Company has access to additional capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations\nor other means; however, the Company cannot provide any assurance that other new financings will be available on commercially acceptable terms, if needed. If the economic\nclimate in the U.S. deteriorates, the Company’s ability to raise additional capital could be negatively impacted. If the Company is unable to secure additional capital, it may be\nrequired to take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve its cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet its obligations. These measures could\ncause significant delays in the Company’s continued efforts to commercialize its products, which is critical to the realization of its business plan and the future operations of the\nCompany. This uncertainty along with the Company’s history of losses indicates that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern\nwithin one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be\nnecessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 3 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Aquamed Technologies, Inc. (“Aquamed”),\nOculus Technologies of Mexico S.A. de C.V. (“OTM”), and Sonoma Pharmaceuticals Netherlands, B.V. (“SP Europe”). Aquamed has no current operations. All significant\nintercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The functional currency for the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries incorporated outside the\nUnited States (“U.S.”) is denominated in local currency. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nF-6\nBasis of presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”) and are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s fiscal year end is March 31. Unless otherwise\nstated, all years and dates refer to the fiscal year.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased. The Company’s cash\nequivalents are held in prime money market investments with strong sponsor organizations which are monitored on a continuous basis.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements\nand the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions include\nreserves and write-downs related to receivables and inventories, the valuation allowance relating to the Company’s deferred tax assets, valuation of equity and the estimated\namortization periods of upfront product licensing fees received from customers. Periodically, the Company evaluates and adjusts estimates accordingly.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”). Revenue\nis recognized when the Company transfers promised goods or services to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in\nexchange for those goods or services. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations under the agreement, the\nCompany performs the following steps: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are\nperformance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable\nconsideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance\nobligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that it will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or\nservices it transfers to the customer.\nThe Company derives the majority of its revenue through sales of its products directly to end users and to distributors. The Company also sells products to a customer base,\nincluding hospitals, medical centers, doctors, pharmacies, distributors and wholesalers. The Company has also entered into agreements to license its technology and products.\nThe Company considers customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements, to be the contracts with a customer. For each contract, the\nCompany considers the promise to transfer products, each of which are distinct, to be the identified performance obligations. In determining the transaction price the Company\nevaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which it expects to be entitled.\nFor all of the Company’s sales to non-consignment distribution channels, revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e. when its\nperformance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs when title passes to the customer upon shipment but could occur when the customer receives the product based on\nthe terms of the agreement with the customer. For product sales to its value-added resellers, non-stocking distributors and end-user customers, the Company grants return\nprivileges to its customers, and because the Company has a long history with its customers, the Company is able to estimate the amount of product that will be returned.\nF-7\nThe Company has entered into consignment arrangements, in which goods are left in the possession of another party to sell. As products are sold from the customer to third\nparties, the Company recognizes revenue based on a variable percentage of a fixed price. Revenue recognized varies depending on whether a patient is covered by insurance or\nis not covered by insurance. In addition, the Company may incur a revenue deduction related to the use of the Company’s rebate program.\nSales to stocking distributors are made under terms with fixed pricing and limited rights of return (known as “stock rotation”) of the Company’s products held in their\ninventory. Revenue from sales to distributors is recognized upon the transfer of control to the distributor.\nThe Company assessed the promised goods and services in the technical support contract with Invekra for a ten-year period as being a distinct service that Invekra can benefit\nfrom on its own and as separately identifiable from any other promises within the contract. Given that the distinct service is not substantially the same as other goods and\nservices within the Invekra contract, the Company accounted for the distinct service as a performance obligation.\nConcentration of Credit Risk and Major Customers\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Cash and cash\nequivalents are maintained in financial institutions in the United States, Mexico and the Netherlands. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by these\nfinancial institutions for amounts in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. Cash and cash equivalents held in foreign banks are intentionally kept\nat minimal levels, and therefore have minimal credit risk associated with them. We currently have $1,185,000 of deposits above federally insured limits.\nThe following table shows major customers revenues as a percentage of net revenue:\nFor the Year Ended March 31,\n2024 2023\nCustomer A 17% 11%\nCustomer B 15% 16%\nCustomer C 14% 18%\nCustomer D *% *%\nThe following table shows major customers accounts receivable balances as a percentage of net accounts receivables:\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nCustomer A *% *%\nCustomer B 13% 22%\nCustomer C *% *%\nCustomer D 17% 21%\n* Represents less than 10%\nF-8\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded net of allowances for cash discounts for prompt payment, doubtful accounts, and sales returns. Estimates for cash discounts and sales\nreturns are based on analysis of contractual terms and historical trends.\nThe Company’s policy is to reserve for uncollectible accounts based on its best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The\nCompany periodically reviews its accounts receivable to determine whether an allowance for doubtful accounts is necessary based on an analysis of past due accounts and other\nfactors that may indicate that the realization of an account may be in doubt. Other factors that the Company considers include its existing contractual obligations, historical\npayment patterns of its customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region, and a review of the local\neconomic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. Account balances deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance\nafter all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company did not deem it necessary to record an allowance for\ndoubtful accounts for probable credit losses at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023. Additionally, at March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has allowances of $27,000 and\n$16,000, respectively, related to potential discounts, returns, distributor fees and rebates. The allowances are included in Accounts Receivable, net in the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost, cost being determined on a standard cost basis (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis), or net realizable value.\nDue to changing market conditions, estimated future requirements, age of the inventories on hand and production of new products, the Company regularly reviews inventory\nquantities on hand and records a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value. At March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company\nrecorded provisions to reduce the carrying amounts of inventories to their net realizable value in the amounts of $296,000 and $236,000, respectively. which is included in\ninventories, net on the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities\nFinancial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are carried at cost, which management believes approximates fair value\ndue to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of capital lease obligations and equipment loans approximates their carrying amounts as a market rate of\ninterest is attached to their repayment. The Company measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the\nmeasurement date. The Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The Company uses three\nlevels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\nLevel 2 – quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived\nvaluations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets\nF-9\nLevel 3 – inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)\nLevel 3 liabilities are valued using unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the liabilities. For fair value\nmeasurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the Company’s accounting and finance department, who report to the Chief Financial Officer, determine its\nvaluation policies and procedures. The development and determination of the unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements and fair value calculations are the\nresponsibility of the Company’s accounting and finance department and are approved by the Chief Financial Officer.\nAs of March 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no transfers in or out of Level 3 from other levels in the fair value hierarchy.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method\nover the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Depreciation of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated\nuseful life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease. Estimated useful asset life by classification is as follows:\nYears\nOffice equipment 3\nManufacturing, lab and other equipment 5\nFurniture and fixtures 7\nUpon retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations.\nMaintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company periodically reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances would indicate that it is more likely than not that their\ncarrying values may exceed their realizable values, and records impairment charges when considered necessary. Specific potential indicators of impairment include, but are not\nnecessarily limited to:\n· a significant decrease in the fair value of an asset;\n· a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant physical change in an asset;\n· a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that affects the value of an asset;\n· an adverse action or assessment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or another regulator; and\n· an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset; and operating or cash flow losses combined with a\nhistory of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an income-producing asset.\nWhen circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred, the Company tests such assets for recoverability by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash\nflows expected to result from the use of such assets and their eventual disposition to their carrying amounts. In estimating these future cash flows, assets and liabilities are\ngrouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other such groups. If the undiscounted future\ncash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss, measured as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value, will be\nrecognized. The cash flow estimates used in such calculations are based on estimates and assumptions, using all available information that management believes is reasonable.\nThe Company did not record impairment losses for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nF-10\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred and consists primarily of personnel expenses, clinical and regulatory services and supplies. For the\nyears ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, research and development expense amounted to $1,871,000 and $207,000, respectively.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are charged to operations as incurred. Advertising costs amounted to $156,000 and $156,000 for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAdvertising costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nThe Company classifies amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling in sale transactions as product revenues. The corresponding shipping and handling costs\nincurred are recorded in cost of product revenues. For the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded revenue related to shipping and handling costs of\n$28,000 and $42,000, respectively. These amounts are included in product revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nForeign Currency Reporting\nThe Company’s subsidiary, OTM, uses the local currency (Mexican Pesos) as its functional currency and its subsidiary, SP Europe, uses the local currency (Euro) as its\nfunctional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenue and expense accounts are translated at average\nexchange rates during the period. Resulting translation adjustments amounted to $695,000 and $894,000 for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These\namounts were recorded in other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nForeign currency transaction losses relate primarily to trade payables and receivables and intercompany transactions between subsidiaries OTM and SP Europe. These\ntransactions are expected to be settled in the foreseeable future. The Company recorded foreign currency transaction losses of $825,000 and $692,000 for the years ended\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The related amounts were recorded in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based awards exchanged for employee services at the estimated grant date fair value of the award. The Company estimates the fair value of\nemployee stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company amortizes the fair value of employee stock options on a straight-line basis over the\nrequisite service period of the awards. Compensation expense includes the impact of forfeitures for all stock options as incurred.\nThe Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to\nperiodic adjustment as the underlying equity instrument vests or becomes non-forfeitable. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges are amortized over the vesting\nperiod or as earned.\nF-11\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit\ncarryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to impact taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary\nto reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.\nTax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is\nonly recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax\nbenefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of\nbeing realized upon ultimate resolution. Uncertain tax positions have had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of comprehensive loss or cash\nflows.\nComprehensive Loss\nOther comprehensive loss includes all changes in stockholders’ equity during a period from non-owner sources and is reported in the consolidated statements of changes in\nstockholders’ equity. To date, other comprehensive loss consists of changes in accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments. Accumulated other comprehensive losses\nat March 31, 2024 and 2023 were $2,723,000 and $3,418,000, respectively.\nNet Loss per Share\nThe Company computes basic net loss per share by dividing net loss per share available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding for the period and excludes the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share, if presented, would include the dilution that would occur\nupon the exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities into common stock using the “treasury stock” and/or “if converted” methods as applicable.\nFor the Year Ended March 31,\n(In thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (4,835) $ (5,151)\nWeighted-average shares outstanding: basic and diluted 9,090 3,394\nNet loss per share: basic and diluted $ (0.53) $ (1.52)\nF-12\nThe computation of basic loss per share for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 excludes the potentially dilutive securities summarized in the table below because their\ninclusion would be anti-dilutive.\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nCommon stock to be issued upon exercise of options 1,033 565\nCommon stock to be issued upon exercise of warrants – 104\nCommon stock to be issued upon exercise of common stock units (1) – 46\n1,033 715\n(1) Consists of 30,668 restricted stock units and warrants to purchase 15,332 shares of common stock\nCommon Stock Purchase Warrants and Other Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company classifies common stock purchase warrants and other free standing derivative financial instruments as equity if the contracts (i) require physical settlement or\nnet-share settlement or (ii) give the Company a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The Company\nclassifies any contracts that (i) require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the\nCompany), (ii) give the counterparty a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement), or (iii) contain reset provisions as\neither an asset or a liability. The Company assesses classification of its freestanding derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification between\nassets and liabilities is required. The Company determined that its freestanding derivatives, which principally consist of warrants to purchase common stock, satisfied the\ncriteria for classification as equity instruments, other than certain warrants that contained reset provisions and certain warrants that required net-cash settlement that the\nCompany classified as derivative liabilities. The company currently does not have any active derivative financial instruments.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company applies the accounting standards for distinguishing liabilities from equity when determining the classification and measurement of its preferred stock. Shares that\nare subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. The Company classifies conditionally redeemable preferred\nshares, which includes preferred shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain\nevents not solely within the Company’s control, as temporary equity. At all other times, preferred shares are classified as stockholders' equity.\nSubsequent Events\nManagement has evaluated subsequent events or transactions occurring through the date these consolidated financial statements were issued.\nSale of Common Stock\nIn connection with the Equity Distribution Agreement that the Company entered into on December 15, 2023 with Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim”), as amended, from May 13,\n2024 to May 22, 2024 the Company sold 3,166,202 shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of $786,000 and net proceeds of $762,000 after deducting commissions and\nother estimated offering expenses paid by the Company.\nEquity Grants\nOn June 14, 2024, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved an equity award of 53,586 Restricted Stock Units to each of Ms. Trombly, Mr. Dvonch and\nMr. Thornton, to be issued to on June 20, 2024, at a valuation based on the Company’s five day weighted-average stock price prior to the date of grant.\nF-13\nRecent Accounting Standards\nThe Company has evaluated all the recent accounting standards and determined that none of them are material to it.\nNOTE 4 – Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable, net consists of the following:\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nAccounts receivable $ 2,925,000 $ 2,588,000\nLess: discounts, rebates, distributor fees and returns (27,000) (16,000)\nTotal accounts receivable, net $ 2,898,000 $ 2,572,000\nNOTE 5 – Inventories\nInventories, net consists of the following:\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nRaw materials $ 1,802,000 $ 1,764,000\nFinished goods 1,213,000 1,330,000\n3,015,000 3,094,000\nLess: allowance for obsolete and excess inventory (296,000) (236,000)\nTotal inventories $ 2,719,000 $ 2,858,000\nNOTE 6 – Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following:\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nPrepaid insurance $ 340,000 $ 438,000\nTax prepaid to Mexican tax authorities 3,096,000 3,845,000\nOther prepaid expenses and other current assets 105,000 25,000\n$ 3,541,000 $ 4,308,000\nF-14\nNOTE 7 – Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, net consists of the following:\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nManufacturing, lab, and other equipment $ 1,776,000 $ 1,624,000\nOffice equipment 236,000 202,000\nFurniture and fixtures 128,000 122,000\nLeasehold improvements 605,000 554,000\n2,745,000 2,502,000\nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization (2,380,000) (2,014,000)\nTotal property and equipment, net and equipment, net $ 365,000 $ 488,000\nDepreciation and amortization expense amounted to $176,000 and $125,000 for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNOTE 8 – Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following:\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nSalaries and related costs $ 1,419,000 $ 1,463,000\nOther 694,000 566,000\nTotal accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 2,113,000 $ 2,029,000\nNOTE 9 – Debt\nFinancing of Insurance Premiums\nOn February 6, 2024, the Company entered into a note agreement for $373,000 with an interest rate of 8.42% per annum with final payment on November 1, 2024.

These executive employment agreements provide, among other things, for the payment of\nup to eighteen months of severance compensation for terminations under certain circumstances.\nAmendments\nOn June 16, 2023, we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, Amy Trombly. The amended and restated agreement\nprovides that, in the event of termination upon change of control either without cause or for good reason, Ms. Trombly is entitled to receive, in addition to the other benefits\ndescribed therein, a lump sum severance equal to one and a half times her base salary and one and a half times her target annual bonus.

Additionally, the Company is authorized to issue 714,286 shares of convertible preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share.\nDescription of Common Stock\nEach share of common stock has the right to one vote. The holders of common stock are entitled to dividends when funds are legally available and when declared by the board\nof directors.\nDescription of Series B Preferred Stock\nOn October 18, 2016, the Company’s board of directors approved, and the Company entered into, a Section 382 rights agreement, or the Rights Agreement, with\nComputershare Inc., or the Rights Agent. The Rights Agreement provides for a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right, or a Right, for each share of common stock, par\nvalue $0.0001 per share, of the Company outstanding on November 1, 2016, or the Record Date. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company one one-\nthousandth of a share of Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, or the Preferred Stock, for a purchase price of $10.00, subject to adjustment as provided in the\nRights Agreement. The description and terms of the rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement.\nIn connection with the adoption of the Rights Agreement, the Company’s board of directors adopted a Certificate of Designation of Series B Preferred Stock. The Certificate of\nDesignation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and became effective on October 18, 2016.\nThe Company’s board of directors adopted the Rights Agreement to protect shareholder value by guarding against a potential limitation on the Company’s ability to use its net\noperating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and other tax benefits, which may be used to reduce potential future income tax obligations. The Company has experienced and\ncontinues to experience substantial operating losses, and under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and rules promulgated thereunder, the Company may “carry\nforward” these NOLs and other tax benefits in certain circumstances to offset any current and future earnings and thus reduce our income tax liability, subject to certain\nrequirements and restrictions. To the extent that the NOLs and other tax benefits do not otherwise become limited, the Company believes that it will be able to carry forward a\nsignificant amount of NOLs and other tax benefits, and therefore these NOLs and other tax benefits could be a substantial asset to the Company. However, if the Company\nexperiences an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Code, its ability to use its NOLs and other tax benefits will be substantially limited. Generally, an\nownership change would occur if our shareholders who own, or are deemed to own, 5% or more of the Company’s common stock increase their collective ownership in the\nCompany by more than 50% over a rolling three-year period.\nSale of Common Stock\nOn October 26, 2023, the Company entered into a placement agency agreement with Maxim, pursuant to which Maxim agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit offers\nto purchase up to an aggregate of 8,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The Company agreed to pay Maxim a cash fee equal to 8.0%\nof the gross proceeds from the offering, plus reimbursement of up to $75,000 of legal fees and other expenses. Additionally, on October 26, 2023, the Company entered into a\nsecurities purchase agreement with the purchasers party thereto for the sale and issuance of an aggregate of up to 8,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at a public\noffering price of $0.20 per share. The closing of the offering occurred on October 30, 2023. In connection with the offering, the Company sold 8,500,000 shares of the\nCompany’s common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,700,000 and net proceeds of $1,446,000, after deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering\nexpenses paid by the Company.\nF-18\nOn December 15, 2023, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Agreement”), with Maxim Group LLC, pursuant to which the Company may offer\nand sell, from time to time, through Maxim, as sales agent or principal, shares of its common stock, $0.0001 par value per share. Subject to the terms and conditions of the\nAgreement, Maxim will use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices, applicable state and federal law, rules and regulations and\nthe rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market to sell shares from time to time based upon the Company’s instructions, including any price, time or size limits specified by the\nCompany. Under the Agreement, Maxim may sell shares by any method deemed to be an “at the market” offering as defined in Rule 415 under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933,\nas amended, or any other method permitted by law, including in privately negotiated transactions. Maxim’s obligations to sell shares under the Agreement are subject to\nsatisfaction of certain conditions, including customary closing conditions for transactions of this nature. The Company will pay Maxim a commission of 3% of the aggregate\ngross proceeds from each sale of shares and has agreed to provide Maxim with customary indemnification and contribution rights. The Company also agreed to reimburse\nMaxim for certain specified expenses of up to $20,000. On January 11, 2024, the Company sold 1,923,100 shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of approximately\n$392,000 and net proceeds of $338,000 after deducting commissions and other estimated offering expenses paid by the Company.\nNOTE 13 – Stock-Based Compensation\n2016 Stock Plan\nOn September 2, 2016, upon recommendation of the board, the stockholders approved the Company’s 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”). The 2016 Plan is effective\nas of September 2, 2016 and has a ten year term.\nThe 2016 Plan provides for the grant of options, including incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code to employees, stock appreciation\nrights, restricted awards, performance share awards and performance compensation awards to employees, non-employee directors, advisors and consultants.\nOptions issued under the 2016 Plan generally have a ten-year term.\nIn accordance with the 2016 Plan, the stated exercise price of an employee incentive stock option or a non-statutory stock option shall not be less than 100% of the estimated\nfair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant. An employee who owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of outstanding\nstock of the Company shall not be eligible for the grant of an employee incentive stock option unless such grant satisfies the requirements of Section 422(c)(5) of the Internal\nRevenue Code.\nShares subject to awards that expire unexercised or are forfeited or terminated for any other reason will again become available for issuance under the 2016 Plan. No participant\nin the 2016 Plan can receive more than 11,112 option grants, or other awards with respect to more than 13,334 shares in the aggregate in any calendar year.\nThe board has authorized 44,445 of the Company’s common stock for issuance under the 2016 Plan, in addition to automatic increases provided for in the 2016 Plan through\nApril 1, 2026. The number of shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan will automatically increase, with no further action by the\nstockholders, at the beginning of each fiscal year by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 8% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock on the last day of the\nimmediately preceding year, or (ii) an amount determined by the Company’s board of directors. During the year ended March 31, 2019, the board of directors approved an\nincrease of 4,860 shares authorized for issuance. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the board of directors approved an increase of 105,306 shares authorized for issuance.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2022, the board of directors approved an increase of 167,432 shares authorized for issuance.\nAt March 31, 2024 there were 1,467 shares available for future issuance.\nF-19\n2021 Stock Plan\nOn September 21, 2021, upon recommendation of the board, the stockholders approved the Company’s 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). The 2021 Plan is\neffective as of September 21, 2021 and has a five year term.\nThe 2021 Plan provides for the grant of options, including incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code to employees, stock appreciation\nrights, restricted awards, performance share awards and performance compensation awards to employees, non-employee directors, advisors and consultants.\nOptions issued under the 2021 Plan generally have a ten-year term.\nIn accordance with the 2021 Plan, the stated exercise price of an employee incentive stock option or a non-statutory stock option shall not be less than 100% of the estimated\nfair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant. An employee who owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of outstanding\nstock of the Company shall not be eligible for the grant of an employee incentive stock option unless such grant satisfies the requirements of Section 422(c)(5) of the Internal\nRevenue Code.\nShares subject to awards that expire unexercised or are forfeited or terminated for any other reason will again become available for issuance under the 2021 Plan.\nThe board has authorized 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock for issuance under the 2021 Plan.\nAt March 31, 2024, there were 124,089 shares available for future issuance.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company issues service, performance and market-based stock options to employees and non-employees. The Company estimates the fair value of service and performance\nstock option awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company estimates the fair value of market-based stock option awards using a Monte-Carlo simulation.\nCompensation expense for stock option awards is amortized on a straight-line basis over the awards’ vesting period. Compensation expense includes the impact of forfeitures as\nthey are incurred.\nThe expected term of the stock options represents the average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is based on the expected term calculated using\nthe approach prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110 for “plain vanilla” options. The expected stock price volatility for the\nCompany’s stock options was determined by using an average of the historical volatilities of the Company. The Company will continue to analyze the stock price volatility and\nexpected term assumptions as more data for the Company’s common stock and exercise patterns become available. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on the U.S.\nTreasury instruments whose term was consistent with the expected term of the Company’s stock options. The expected dividend assumption is based on the Company’s history\nand expectation of dividend payouts.\nF-20\nThe Company estimated the fair value of employee and non-employee stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of employee stock options is\nbeing amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the respective awards. The fair value of employee stock options was estimated using the following\nweighted-average assumptions:\nYear Ended March 31,\n2024 2023\nFair value of the Company’s common stock on date of grant $ 0.19 $ 1.09\nExpected term 5.56 yrs 6.00 yrs\nRisk-free interest rate 3.87% 3.92%\nDividend yield 0.00% 0.00%\nVolatility 98.40% 110.88%\nFair value of options granted $ 0.15 $ 0.92\nDuring the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred $516,000 and $669,000, respectively of stock-based compensation expense. All stock-based\ncompensation incurred is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nAt March 31, 2024, there were unrecognized compensation costs of $311,000 related to stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average amortization\nperiod of 1.19 years.\nStock-Based Award Activity\nStock-based awards outstanding at March 31, 2024 under the various plans are as follows:\nPlan Stock Options\n2006 Plan 183\n2011 Plan 81,336\n2016 Plan 328,733\n2021 Plan 622,747\n1,032,999\nStock options award activity is as follows:\nWeighted- Weighted- Aggregate\nNumber of Average Average Intrinsic\nShares Exercise Price Contractual Term Value\nOutstanding at April 1, 2023 565,027 $ 8.84\nOptions granted 500,000 0.19\nOptions exercised – –\nOptions forfeited (17,753) 1.40\nOptions expired (14,275) 128.54\nOutstanding at March 31, 2024 1,032,999 $ 3.13 8.91 $ 2.25\nExercisable at March 31, 2024 698,454 $ 4.06 8.54 $ 2.25\nF-21\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of stock options is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying stock options and the fair value of the Company’s\ncommon stock, or $0.17 and $0.98 per share at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nRestricted stock award activity is as follows:\nWeighted\nAverage Award\nNumber of Date Fair Value\nShares per Share\nUnvested restricted stock awards outstanding at April 1, 2023 – $ –\nRestricted stock awards granted 251,000 1.04\nRestricted stock awards vested (251,000) 1.04\nUnvested restricted stock awards outstanding at March 31, 2024 – $ –\nThe Company did not capitalize any cost associated with stock-based compensation.\nThe Company issues new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards.\nNOTE 14 – Income Taxes\nThe income tax provision (benefit) is based on the following loss before income taxes, which are from domestic and foreign sources:\nYear Ended March 31,\n2024 2023\nDomestic $ (364,000) $ (988,000)\nForeign (4,559,000) (4,194,000)\nTotals $ (4,923,000) $ (5,182,000)\nThe federal, state and foreign income tax provisions are summarized as follows:\nYear Ended March 31,\n2024 2023\nCurrent:\nState $ 2,000 $ 2,000\nDeferred Foreign (198,000) (35,000)\nTotal income tax benefit $ (196,000) $ (33,000)\nF-22\nA reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate for continuing operations is as follows:\nYear Ended March 31,\n2024 2023\nExpected federal statutory rate 21.0% 21.0%\nState income taxes 0.2% 0.8%\nForeign earnings taxed at different rates 7.9% 6.5%\nEffect of permanent differences (5.8%) (7.5%)\nEffect of intercompany interest permanent differences (20.1%) (16.1%)\nTrue-up of state deferred assets (1.5%) 1.3%\n1.7% 6.0%\nChange in valuation allowance 2.3% (5.4%)\nTotals 4.0% 0.6%\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant components of our deferred tax assets consist of:\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryforwards $ 28,692,000 $ 28,558,000\nResearch and development tax credit carryforwards 1,796,000 1,800,000\nStock-based compensation 913,000 739,000\nReserves and accruals 659,000 795,000\nOther deferred tax assets 52,000 20,000\nLease liability 22,000 24,000\nGross deferred tax assets $ 32,134,000 $ 31,936,000\nLess valuation allowance (30,836,000) (30,809,000)\nTotal deferred tax assets $ 1,298,000 $ 1,127,000\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nFixed assets (10,000) (16,000)\nPrepaid expenses (121,000) (138,000)\nRight of use asset (22,000) (24,000)\nGross deferred tax liabilities (153,000) (178,000)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 1,145,000 $ 949,000\nF-23\nAs of March 31, 2024, we have net operating loss carryforwards for Federal, State and foreign income tax purposes of approximately $116,600,000, $43,200,000 and\n$1,800,000 respectively. Due to the Tax Cuts and Job Act, Federal NOL generated after March 31, 2018 have an indefinite life. Federal NOL generated on and before March 31,\n2017 will begin to expire 2024, if not utilized. State NOLs will begin to expire in the year 2026, if not utilized. Foreign NOLs will carry forward for 10 years.\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had Federal and California research and development credit carryforward of approximately $1,006,000 and $790,000 respectively. The Federal\nresearch and development credits will begin to expire in 2024 while the California research and development credits have no expiration date.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code limits the use of the Federal net operating losses in certain situations where changes occur in stock ownership of a company. If the\nCompany should have an ownership change of more than 50% of the value of the Company's capital stock, utilization of the carryforwards could be restricted. The Company is\nnot aware of any changes in ownership that would result in a change in control under Internal Revenue Code section 382.\nThe Company released the valuation allowance recorded against its Netherlands deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2024. Given its recent history of earnings, current earnings\nand anticipated future earnings, the Company concluded that there is sufficient positive evidence available to reach a conclusion that the valuation allowance is no longer\nneeded in the Netherlands. The release of the valuation allowance resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets of $114,000. The Company, after considering all available\nevidence, fully reserved against all deferred tax assets in the U.S. since it is more likely than not such benefits will not be realized in future periods. The Company will continue\nto evaluate its deferred tax assets to determine whether any changes in circumstances could affect the realization of their future benefit.\nThe Company has filed tax returns for federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s evaluation of uncertain tax matters was performed for tax years ended through\nMarch 31, 2024. Generally, the Company is subject to audit for the years ended March 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The Company has elected to retain its existing accounting\npolicy with respect to the treatment of interest and penalties attributable to income taxes, and continues to reflect interest and penalties attributable to income taxes, to the extent\nthey arise, as a component of its income tax provision or benefit as well as its outstanding income tax assets and liabilities. The Company believes that its income tax positions\nand deductions would be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments result in a material change to its financial position.\nNOTE 15 – Employee Benefit Plan\nThe Company has a program to contribute and administer a qualified 401(k) plan. Under the 401(k) plan, the Company matches employee contributions to the plan up to 4% of\nthe employee’s salary. Company contributions to the plan amounted to an aggregate of $82,000 and $101,000 for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNOTE 16 – Revenue Disaggregation\nThe Company generates product revenues from products which are sold into the human and animal healthcare markets, and the Company generates service revenues from\nlaboratory testing services which are provided to medical device manufacturers.\nF-24\nThe following table presents the Company’s disaggregated revenues by source:\nYear Ended March 31,\n2024 2023\nProduct:\nHuman Care $ 10,110,000 $ 9,426,000\nAnimal Care 2,203,000 2,500,000\nTotal Product Revenue 12,313,000 11,926,000\nService/Royalty 422,000 1,346,000\nTotal $ 12,735,000 $ 13,272,000\nThe following table shows the Company’s revenues by geographic region:\nYear Ended March 31,\n2024 2023\nUnited States $ 3,058,000 $ 3,428,000\nEurope 4,781,000 4,051,000\nAsia 2,298,000 2,451,000\nLatin America 1,726,000 2,383,000\nRest of the World 872,000 959,000\nTotal $ 12,735,000 $ 13,272,000\nF-25\nITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures\nNone.\nITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange\nAct is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of our\nmost recent fiscal quarter. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not\neffective as of March 31, 2024 due to the fact that material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting exist at year end.\nNotwithstanding our ineffective disclosure controls and procedures, management believes the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\npresent fairly, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the years presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles.\nEvaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)\nand 15d-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial\nstatements would be prevented or detected. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the 2013 Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control\nover financial reporting was not effective as of March 31, 2024. We have determined that there were inadequate spreadsheet controls, a lack of separation of duties with\npreparation and review of the reported numbers, and inadequate analysis of revenue reporting among other things. We believe we have taken steps to correct this, but the\ncontrols have not been tested and have not been working for a sufficient period of time to remove this weakness.\nManagement’s Remediation Measures\nManagement, with oversight from the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, is actively engaged in remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses identified in the\nmanagement’s evaluation of internal controls and procedures. Management has taken a number of actions to remediate the material weaknesses described above, including the\nfollowing:\n· Improved monitoring and risk assessment activities to address these control deficiencies.\n· Hired an experienced Chief Financial Officer and Controller in 2023.\n· Separated the preparation of the financial reports from review of the financial reports.\n· Implemented additional process-level controls over revenue recognition of new contracts.\n· Developed and delivered further internal controls training to individuals associated with these control deficiencies and enhanced training provided to all personnel who\nhave financial reporting or internal control responsibilities in these areas. The training includes a review of individual roles and responsibilities related to internal\ncontrols, proper oversight and reemphasizes the importance of completing the control procedures.\n· Did a detailed review of income taxes and our intercompany agreements which uncovered the fact that we should be accruing withholding taxes that will be paid to\nMexico when intercompany interest and technical assistance payments are made to Mexico from the United States and that we will not be eligible for a tax credit in\nthe United States because of our net operating loss positions.\n44\nThese improvements are targeted at strengthening our internal control over financial reporting and remediating the material weaknesses. We remain committed to an effective\ninternal control environment, and management believes that these actions and the improvements management expects to achieve as a result will effectively remediate the\nmaterial weaknesses. However, the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be considered remediated until the controls operate for a\nsufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing that these controls operate effectively. As of the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nmanagement is in the process of testing and evaluating these additional controls to determine whether they are operating effectively. We have hired appropriate accounting staff\nto establish effective internal controls and processes.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not finished testing our controls and sufficient time has not elapsed to make the determination these\ncontrols are operating effectively.\nITEM 9B.

(the “Company”) has adopted this Policy (the\n“Policy”) to provide for the recovery of erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation from Executive Officers.\nI. RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY AWARDED COMPENSATION\n(A) In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company will reasonably promptly recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received in accordance with\nNasdaq Rules and Rule 10D-1 as follows:\n1. After an Accounting Restatement, the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) shall determine the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received\nby each Executive Officer and shall promptly notify each Executive Officer with a written notice containing the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation and a\ndemand for repayment or return of such compensation, as applicable.\n2. For Incentive-based Compensation based on (or derived from) the Company’s stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable Accounting Restatement:\n(i) The amount to be repaid or returned shall be determined by the Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on\nthe Company’s stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-based Compensation was Received; and\n(ii) The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of such reasonable estimate and provide the relevant documentation as required Nasdaq.\n3. The Committee shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on the particular facts and\ncircumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in Section (B) below, in no event may the Company accept an amount that is less than the amount of\nErroneously Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of an Executive Officer’s obligations hereunder.\n4. To the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company for any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received under any duplicative recovery\nobligations established by the Company or applicable law, it shall be appropriate for any such reimbursed amount to be credited to the amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy.\n5. To the extent that an Executive Officer fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company when due, the Company shall take all actions reasonable\nand appropriate to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable Executive Officer. The applicable Executive Officer shall be required to reimburse the\nCompany for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with the\nimmediately preceding sentence.\n(B) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the actions contemplated by Section (A) above if the Committee\n(which, as specified above, is composed entirely of independent directors or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board)\ndetermines that recovery would be impracticable and either of the following conditions are met:\n1. The Committee has determined that the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before making\nthis determination, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, documented such attempt(s) and provided such\ndocumentation to Nasdaq; or\n1\n2. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the\nrequirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder.\nII. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy required by applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings and rules.\nIII. PROHIBITION OF INDEMNIFICATION\nThe Company shall not be permitted to insure or indemnify any Executive Officer against (i) the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is repaid,\nreturned or recovered pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to the Company’s enforcement of its rights under this Policy. Further, the Company shall\nnot enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive-based Compensation that is granted, paid or awarded to an Executive Officer from the application of this Policy or that\nwaives the Company’s right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into before, on or\nafter the Effective Date of this Policy).\nIV. ADMINISTRATION AND INTERPRETATION\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Committee, and any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nThe Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this\nPolicy and for the Company’s compliance with Nasdaq Rules, Section 10D, Rule 10D-1 and any other applicable law, regulation, rule or interpretation of the SEC or Nasdaq\npromulgated or issued in connection therewith.\nV. AMENDMENT; TERMINATION\nThe Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary. Notwithstanding anything in this Section\nF to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the\nCompany contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule or Nasdaq rule.\nVI. OTHER RECOVERY RIGHTS\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and, to the extent required by applicable law or guidance from the SEC or Nasdaq, their\nbeneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives. The Committee intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent required by applicable\nlaw. Any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan or any other agreement or arrangement with an Executive Officer shall be deemed to include, as\na condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, an agreement by the Executive Officer to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in\naddition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company under applicable law, regulation or rule or pursuant to the terms of\nany policy of the Company or any provision in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan, agreement or other arrangement.\n2\nVII.

Stock price and total shareholder return (and any measures that are derived\nwholly or in part from stock price or total shareholder return) shall, for purposes of this Policy, be considered Financial Reporting Measures. For the avoidance of doubt, a\nFinancial Reporting Measure need not be presented in the Company’s financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC.\n“Incentive-based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting\nMeasure.\n“Nasdaq” means The Nasdaq Stock Market.\n“Received” means, with respect to any Incentive-based Compensation, actual or deemed receipt, and Incentive-based Compensation shall be deemed received in the\nCompany’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the\nIncentive-based Compensation to the Executive Officer occurs after the end of that period.\n“Restatement Date” means the earlier to occur of (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board or the officers of the Company authorized to take such action if\nBoard action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (ii) the date a court,\nregulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\nEffective as of October 2, 2023.\n3"

products\ncontaining benzoyl peroxide.\n• Testing by Valisure showed that benzoyl peroxide in dermatology products from major\nbrands including Proactiv, Clearasil, and CeraVe, can form benzene, a known human\ncarcinogen, at unacceptably high levels.\n• Previous testing by Valisure has found unacceptably high levels of benzene in common\nhand sanitizers, as well as in after-sun products by brands such as Hawaiian Tropic and\nBanana Boat.\nSonoma’s products offer a safe yet highly effective alternative for consumers\nconcerned with harmful ingredients in skin care products.\n12\nSafety

sampling.\n• The warnings in October 2023 applied to eye drops by brands such as CVS,\nRite Aid, Target and Walmart, which were then voluntarily recalled by the\nmanufacturer. 1\n• Sonoma owns its own
