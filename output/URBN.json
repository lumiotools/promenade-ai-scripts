(NASDAQ:URBN), a leading lifestyle products and services company which operates a portfolio of global consumer brands including the Anthropologie, Free People, FP Movement, Urban Outfitters and Nuuly brands, today announced record third quarter net income of $102.9 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.10 for the three months ended October 31, 2024. For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, net income was $282.2 million and earnings per diluted share were $2.99.\n\nTotal Company net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2024, increased 6.3% to a record $1.36 billion. Total Retail segment net sales increased 3.2%, with comparable Retail segment net sales increasing 1.5%. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by low single-digit positive growth in both digital channel sales and retail store sales. Comparable Retail segment net sales increased 5.8% at Anthropologie and 5.3% at Free People and decreased 8.9% at Urban Outfitters. Nuuly segment net sales increased by 48.4% primarily driven by a 51% increase in average active subscribers in the current quarter versus the prior year quarter. Wholesale segment net sales increased 17.4% driven by a 20.3% increase in Free People wholesale sales due to an increase in sales to specialty customers and department stores, partially offset by a decrease in Urban Outfitters wholesale sales.\n\nFor the nine months ended October 31, 2024, total Company net sales increased 6.7% to a record $3.91 billion. Total Retail segment net sales increased 4.0%, with comparable Retail segment net sales increasing 2.6%. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by mid single-digit positive growth in digital channel sales and low single-digit positive growth in retail store sales. Comparable Retail segment net sales increased 9.3% at Free People and 7.5% at Anthropologie and decreased 10.6% at Urban Outfitters. Nuuly segment net sales increased by 53.9% primarily driven by a 50% increase in average active subscribers in the current period versus the prior year period. Wholesale segment net sales increased 12.3% driven by a 15.1% increase in Free People wholesale sales due to an increase in sales to specialty customers and department stores, partially offset by a decrease in Urban Outfitters wholesale sales.\n\n“We are pleased to announce record third quarter sales and earnings, both of which exceeded our expectations. These results were driven by outperformance across all three business segments – Retail, Subscription and Wholesale,” said Richard A. Hayne, Chief Executive Officer. “Additionally, we're optimistic about the outlook for Holiday demand and believe total comparable sales could be similar to our third quarter results,” finished Mr. Hayne.\n\nNet sales by brand and segment for the three and nine-month periods were as follows:\n\n**Three Months Ended** | **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**October 31 ,** | **October 31 ,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**Net sales by brand**  \nAnthropologie(1) | $ | 587,923 | $ | 549,819 | $ | 1,683,408 | $ | 1,553,546  \nFree People(2) | 365,857 | 331,772 | 1,049,677 | 936,708  \nUrban Outfitters | 300,577 | 324,375 | 887,550 | 979,507  \nNuuly | 97,232 | 65,516 | 265,870 | 172,779  \nMenus & Venues | 10,266 | 9,692 | 28,041 | 24,503  \nTotal Company | $ | 1,361,855 | $ | 1,281,174 | $ | 3,914,546 | $ | 3,667,043  \n**Net sales by segment**  \nRetail Segment | $ | 1,182,557 | $ | 1,145,766 | $ | 3,441,698 | $ | 3,309,956  \nNuuly Segment | 97,232 | 65,516 | 265,870 | 172,779  \nWholesale Segment | 82,066 | 69,892 | 206,978 | 184,308  \nTotal Company | $ | 1,361,855 | $ | 1,281,174 | $ | 3,914,546 | $ | 3,667,043  \n  \n(1) Anthropologie includes the Anthropologie and Terrain brands.(2) Free People includes the Free People and FP Movement brands.\n\nFor the three months ended October 31, 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 105 basis points compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023. Gross profit dollars increased 9.4% to $497.3 million from $454.4 million in the three months ended October 31, 2023. The increase in gross profit rate for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily due to higher initial merchandise markups for all segments primarily driven by Company cross-functional initiatives. Additionally, Retail segment merchandise markdowns improved driven by lower merchandise markdowns at Urban Outfitters, which were partially offset by an increase at Free People. For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 80 basis points compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2023. Gross profit dollars increased 9.2% to $1.40 billion from $1.28 billion in the nine months ended October 31, 2023. The increase in gross profit rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily due to higher initial merchandise markups for all segments primarily driven by Company cross-functional initiatives. The increase in gross profit dollars for both periods was due to higher net sales and the improved gross profit rate.\n\nAs of October 31, 2024, total inventory increased by $72.3 million, or 10.0%, compared to total inventory as of October 31, 2023. Total Retail segment inventory increased 8.1% due to a Retail segment comparable inventory increase of 3.7% and planned early receipts of holiday merchandise. Wholesale segment inventory increased by 41.6% due to the timing of receipts and to support increased sales.\n\nFor the three months ended October 31, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $23.2 million, or 6.7%, compared to the three months ended October 31, 2023, and expressed as a percentage of net sales, deleveraged 11 basis points. For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $81.8 million, or 8.4%, compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2023, and expressed as a percentage of net sales, deleveraged 42 basis points. The deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses as a rate to net sales for both periods was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support customer growth and increased sales in the Retail and Nuuly segments. The dollar growth in selling, general and administrative expenses for both periods was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support customer growth and increased sales in the Retail and Nuuly segments, as well as increased store payroll expenses to support the Retail segment stores comparable net sales growth.\n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 24.2%, compared to 24.3% in the three months ended October 31, 2023. The Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 was 23.6%, compared to 24.5% in the nine months ended October 31, 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily due to the favorable impact of equity vestings in the current year.\n\nNet income for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was a record $102.9 million or $1.10 per diluted share. Net income for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 was $282.2 million or $2.99 per diluted share.\n\nOn June 4, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 20 million common shares under a share repurchase program. During the nine months ended October 31, 2024, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 1.2 million shares for approximately $52 million. As of October 31, 2024, 18.0 million common shares were remaining under the program.\n\nDuring the nine months ended October 31, 2024, the Company opened a total of 36 new retail locations including: 20 Free People stores (including 12 FP Movement stores), 9 Anthropologie stores and 7 Urban Outfitters stores; and closed 11 retail locations including: 5 Urban Outfitters stores, 4 Anthropologie stores and 2 Free People stores.\n\nUrban Outfitters, Inc. offers lifestyle-oriented general merchandise and consumer products and services through a portfolio of global consumer brands comprised of 264 Urban Outfitters stores in the United States, Canada and Europe and websites; 242 Anthropologie stores in the United States, Canada and Europe, catalogs and websites; 216 Free People stores (including 50 FP Movement stores) in the United States, Canada and Europe, catalogs and websites, 9 Menus & Venues restaurants, 7 Urban Outfitters franchisee-owned stores and 2 Anthropologie franchisee-owned stores as of October 31, 2024.

(NASDAQ:URBN), a leading lifestyle products and services company which operates a portfolio of global consumer brands including the Anthropologie, Free People, FP Movement, Urban Outfitters and Nuuly brands, today announced net income of $117.5 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.24 for the three months ended July 31, 2024. For the six months ended July 31, 2024, net income was $179.3 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.89.\n\nTotal Company net sales for the three months ended July 31, 2024, increased 6.3% to a record $1.35 billion. Total Retail segment net sales increased 3.1%, with comparable Retail segment net sales increasing 2.0%. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by low single-digit positive growth in both digital channel sales and retail store sales. Comparable Retail segment net sales increased 7.1% at Free People and 6.7% at Anthropologie and decreased 9.3% at Urban Outfitters. Nuuly segment net sales increased by 62.6% primarily driven by a 55% increase in average active subscribers in the current quarter versus the prior year quarter. Wholesale segment net sales increased 15.1% driven by a 17.5% increase in Free People wholesale sales due to an increase in sales to department stores and specialty customers, partially offset by a decrease in Urban Outfitters wholesale sales.\n\nFor the six months ended July 31, 2024, total Company net sales increased 7.0% to a record $2.55 billion. Total Retail segment net sales increased 4.4%, with comparable Retail segment net sales increasing 3.2%. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by mid single-digit positive growth in digital channel sales and low single-digit positive growth in retail store sales. Comparable Retail segment net sales increased 11.5% at Free People and 8.4% at Anthropologie and decreased 11.4% at Urban Outfitters. Nuuly segment net sales increased by 57.2% primarily driven by a 50% increase in average active subscribers in the current period versus the prior year period. Wholesale segment net sales increased 9.2% driven by a 11.9% increase in Free People wholesale sales due to an increase in sales to department stores and specialty customers, partially offset by a decrease in Urban Outfitters wholesale sales.\n\n“We are pleased to report record second quarter sales fueled by strength across all three segments – Retail, Nuuly and Wholesale,” said Richard A. Hayne, Chief Executive Officer. “Equally impressive, four of our five brands delivered record operating profits during the second quarter,” finished Mr. Hayne.\n\nNet sales by brand and segment for the three and six-month periods were as follows:\n\n**Three Months Ended** | **Six Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**July 31 ,** | **July 31 ,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**Net sales by brand**  \nAnthropologie(1) | $ | 569,100 | $ | 530,087 | $ | 1,095,485 | $ | 1,003,727  \nFree People(2) | 365,129 | 331,201 | 683,820 | 604,936  \nUrban Outfitters | 316,715 | 346,424 | 586,973 | 655,132  \nNuuly | 90,696 | 55,793 | 168,638 | 107,263  \nMenus & Venues | 10,319 | 8,690 | 17,775 | 14,811  \nTotal Company | $ | 1,351,959 | $ | 1,272,195 | $ | 2,552,691 | $ | 2,385,869  \n**Net sales by segment**  \nRetail Segment | $ | 1,196,456 | $ | 1,160,089 | $ | 2,259,141 | $ | 2,164,190  \nNuuly Segment | 90,696 | 55,793 | 168,638 | 107,263  \nWholesale Segment | 64,807 | 56,313 | 124,912 | 114,416  \nTotal Company | $ | 1,351,959 | $ | 1,272,195 | $ | 2,552,691 | $ | 2,385,869  \n  \n(1) Anthropologie includes the Anthropologie and Terrain brands.(2) Free People includes the Free People and FP Movement brands.\n\nFor the three months ended July 31, 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 68 basis points compared to the three months ended July 31, 2023. Gross profit dollars increased 8.3% to $493.3 million from $455.6 million in the three months ended July 31, 2023. The increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to higher initial merchandise markups for all segments primarily driven by Company cross-functional initiatives, partially offset by higher Retail segment merchandise markdowns, primarily at the Urban Outfitters brand. The increase in gross profit dollars was due to higher net sales and the improved gross profit rate.\n\nFor the six months ended July 31, 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 67 basis points compared to the six months ended July 31, 2023. Gross profit dollars increased 9.1% to $901.7 million from $826.8 million in the six months ended July 31, 2023. The increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to higher initial merchandise markups for all segments primarily driven by Company cross-functional initiatives, partially offset by higher Retail segment merchandise markdowns, primarily at the Urban Outfitters brand, and a deleverage in logistics expenses. The deleverage in logistics expenses was primarily driven by the increased penetration of Nuuly segment sales to total Company sales, as well as transition and start-up expenses related to the additional Nuuly fulfillment facility that opened during the three months ended April 30, 2024. The increase in gross profit dollars was due to higher net sales and the improved gross profit rate.\n\nAs of July 31, 2024, total inventory increased by $18.2 million, or 3.1%, compared to total inventory as of July 31, 2023. Total Retail segment inventory increased 3.1%, while Retail segment comparable inventory decreased by 1.3%. Wholesale segment inventory increased by 3.5%.\n\nFor the three months ended July 31, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $24.7 million, or 7.6%, compared to the three months ended July 31, 2023, and expressed as a percentage of net sales, deleveraged 32 basis points. For the six months ended July 31, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $58.6 million, or 9.4%, compared to the six months ended July 31, 2023, and expressed as a percentage of net sales, deleveraged 59 basis points. The deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses as a rate to net sales for both periods was primarily related to the Urban Outfitters brand not being able to reduce expenses at the same rate of net sales. The dollar growth in selling, general and administrative expenses for both periods was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support customer traffic growth and increased sales in the Retail and Nuuly segments and increased store payroll expenses to support the Retail segment stores comparable sales growth.\n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended July 31, 2024 was 23.0%, compared to 23.2% in the three months ended July 31, 2023. The Company's effective tax rate for the six months ended July 31, 2024 was 23.2%, compared to 24.5% in the six months ended July 31, 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended July 31, 2024 was primarily due to the favorable impact of equity activity in the current year.\n\nNet income for the three months ended July 31, 2024 was $117.5 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.24. Net income for the six months ended July 31, 2024 was $179.3 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.89.\n\nOn June 4, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 20 million common shares under a share repurchase program. During the six months ended July 31, 2024, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 1.2 million shares for approximately $52 million.

(NASDAQ:URBN), a leading lifestyle products and services company which operates a portfolio of global consumer brands including the Anthropologie, Free People, FP Movement, Urban Outfitters and Nuuly brands, today announced net income of $61.8 million and record first quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.65 for the three months ended April 30, 2024. For the three months ended April 30, 2024, adjusted net income was $65.5 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.69. Adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share for the three months ended April 30, 2024, excludes store impairment and lease abandonment charges. See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" included at the end of this release.\n\nTotal Company net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2024, increased 7.8% to a record $1.20 billion. Total Retail segment net sales increased 5.8%, with comparable Retail segment net sales increasing 4.6%. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by high single-digit positive growth in digital channel sales and low single-digit positive growth in retail store sales. Comparable Retail segment net sales increased 17.1% at Free People and 10.4% at Anthropologie and decreased 13.7% at Urban Outfitters. Wholesale segment net sales increased 3.4% driven by a 6.3% increase in Free People wholesale sales due to an increase in sales to department stores and specialty customers, partially offset by a decrease in Urban Outfitters wholesale sales. Nuuly segment net sales increased by 51.4% primarily driven by a 45% increase in average active subscribers in the current quarter versus the prior year quarter.\n\n“We are pleased to report record first quarter sales and earnings driven by continued strength at the Anthropologie, Free People, FP Movement and Nuuly brands,” said Richard A. Hayne, Chief Executive Officer. “Customer demand remains robust for our spring and summer fashion, which bodes well for continued sales growth in Q2,” finished Mr. Hayne.\n\nNet sales by brand and segment for the three-month periods were as follows:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**April 30 ,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**Net sales by brand**  \nAnthropologie(1) | $ | 526,385 | $ | 473,640  \nFree People(2) | 318,691 | 273,735  \nUrban Outfitters | 270,258 | 308,708  \nNuuly | 77,942 | 51,470  \nMenus & Venues | 7,456 | 6,121  \nTotal Company | $ | 1,200,732 | $ | 1,113,674  \n**Net sales by segment**  \nRetail Segment | $ | 1,062,685 | $ | 1,004,101  \nNuuly Segment | 77,942 | 51,470  \nWholesale Segment | 60,105 | 58,103  \nTotal Company | $ | 1,200,732 | $ | 1,113,674  \n(1) | Anthropologie includes the Anthropologie and Terrain brands.  \n---|---  \n(2) | Free People includes the Free People and FP Movement brands.  \n  \nFor the three months ended April 30, 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 68 basis points compared to the three months ended April 30, 2023, and gross profit dollars increased 10.0% to $408.4 million from $371.2 million. For the three months ended April 30, 2024, the adjusted gross profit rate increased by 106 basis points compared to the three months ended April 30, 2023, and adjusted gross profit dollars increased 11.2% to $413.0 million from $371.2 million. The increase in adjusted gross profit rate was primarily due to higher initial merchandise markups for all brands primarily driven by Company cross-functional initiatives, partially offset by higher merchandise markdowns, primarily at the Urban Outfitters brand, and a deleverage in logistics expenses. The deleverage in logistics expenses was primarily driven by the increased penetration of Nuuly segment sales to total Company sales, as well as transition and start-up expenses related to the additional Nuuly fulfillment facility that opened during the three months ended April 30, 2024. The increase in adjusted gross profit dollars was due to higher net sales and the improved adjusted gross profit rate.\n\nAs of April 30, 2024, total inventory decreased by $11.3 million, or 1.9%, compared to total inventory as of April 30, 2023. Total Retail segment inventory decreased 2.3%, while Retail segment comparable inventory decreased 4.7%. Wholesale segment inventory increased by 2.1%.\n\nFor the three months ended April 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $33.9 million, or 11.3%, compared to the three months ended April 30, 2023, and expressed as a percentage of net sales, deleveraged 87 basis points. The deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses as a rate to net sales was primarily related to the Urban Outfitters brand not being able to reduce expenses at the same rate of net sales. The dollar growth in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support double-digit customer traffic growth and increased sales at the Free People, FP Movement, Anthropologie and Nuuly brands and increased store payroll expenses to support the retail stores comparable sales growth.\n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended April 30, 2024 was 23.6%, compared to 27.1% in the three months ended April 30, 2023. The Company's adjusted effective tax rate for the three months ended April 30, 2024 was 23.4%, compared to 27.1% in the three months ended April 30, 2023. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate for the three months ended April 30, 2024 was primarily due to the favorable impact of equity activity in the current year quarter.\n\nNet income for the three months ended April 30, 2024 was $61.8 million and record first quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.65. Adjusted net income for the three months ended April 30, 2024 was $65.5 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.69.\n\nOn June 4, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 20 million common shares under a share repurchase program.

Examples of items that we consider non-core include store impairment and lease abandonment charges. In order to improve the transparency of our disclosures, provide a meaningful presentation of results from our core business operations and improve period-over-period comparability, we have included certain adjusted financial measures for fiscal 2025 that exclude the impact of these non-core business items.\n\nWe believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our underlying results of operations and provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying business. Management uses adjusted financial measures for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the Company’s actual and future financial condition and performance. These adjusted financial measures are not consistent with GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n**URBAN OUTFITTERS, INC.

(NASDAQ:URBN), a leading lifestyle products and services company which operates a portfolio of global consumer brands including the Anthropologie, Free People, FP Movement, Urban Outfitters and Nuuly brands, today announced net income of $47.8 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.50 for the three months ended January 31, 2024. For the year ended January 31, 2024, net income was $287.7 million and earnings per diluted share were $3.05.\n\nFor the three months ended January 31, 2024, adjusted net income was $65.7 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.69. For the year ended January 31, 2024, adjusted net income was $306.7 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $3.25. Adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share for the three months and year ended January 31, 2024, excludes store impairment and lease abandonment charges, an asset impairment charge and a change in revenue recognition method for Nuuly. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included at the end of this release.\n\nTotal Company net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2024, increased 7.3% to a record $1.49 billion. Total Company adjusted net sales for the three months ended January 31, 2024, increased 8.0% to a record $1.50 billion. Total Retail segment net sales increased 6.2%, with comparable Retail segment net sales increasing 4.9%. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by high single-digit positive growth in digital channel sales and low single-digit positive growth in retail store sales. Comparable Retail segment net sales increased 18.9% at Free People and 12.0% at Anthropologie and decreased 13.6% at Urban Outfitters. Wholesale segment net sales increased 3.3% driven by a 7.8% increase in Free People wholesale sales primarily due to an increase in sales to department stores, partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in Urban Outfitters wholesale sales. Nuuly segment net sales increased by $20.3 million. Nuuly segment adjusted net sales increased by $29.4 million. The Nuuly segment adjusted net sales increase was primarily driven by a 56% increase in average active subscribers in the current quarter versus the prior year quarter.\n\nFor the year ended January 31, 2024, total Company net sales increased 7.5% to a record $5.15 billion. Total Company adjusted net sales for the year ended January 31, 2024, increased 7.7% to a record $5.16 billion. Total Retail segment net sales increased 6.0%, with comparable Retail segment net sales increasing 5.0%. The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by mid single-digit positive growth in digital channel sales and mid single-digit positive growth in retail store sales. Comparable Retail segment net sales increased 21.4% at Free People and 12.3% at Anthropologie and decreased 13.8% at Urban Outfitters. Wholesale segment net sales decreased 4.6% driven by a 4.8% decrease in Free People wholesale sales primarily due to decreases in sales to department stores and closeout account partners.

Examples of items that we consider non-core include store impairment and lease abandonment charges, an asset impairment charge and a change in revenue recognition method for Nuuly. In order to improve the transparency of our disclosures, provide a meaningful presentation of results from our core business operations and improve period-over-period comparability, we have included certain adjusted financial measures for fiscal 2024 and 2023 that exclude the impact of these non-core business items.\n\nWe believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our underlying results of operations and provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying business. Management uses adjusted financial measures for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the Company’s actual and future financial condition and performance. These adjusted financial measures are not consistent with GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n**URBAN OUTFITTERS, INC.**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**  \n_(amounts in thousands, except per share data)_  \n_(unaudited)_  \n**Reconciliation of Total Company Adjusted Net Sales:**  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**January 31 ,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**$'s** | **% Change** | **$'s**  \nNet sales (GAAP) | $ | 1,486,194 | 7.3 | % | $ | 1,384,573  \nAdjustments:  \nChange in revenue recognition method for Nuuly (a) | 9,072 | —  \nAdjusted net sales (Non-GAAP) | $ | 1,495,266 | 8.0 | % | $ | 1,384,573  \n**Twelve Months Ended**  \n**January 31 ,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**$'s** | **% Change** | **$'s**  \nNet sales (GAAP) | $ | 5,153,237 | 7.5 | % | $ | 4,795,244  \nAdjustments:  \nChange in revenue recognition method for Nuuly (a) | 9,072 | —  \nAdjusted net sales (Non-GAAP) | $ | 5,162,309 | 7.7 | % | $ | 4,795,244  \n**Reconciliation of Nuuly Segment Adjusted Net Sales:**  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**January 31 ,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**$'s** | **$ Change** | **$'s**  \nNet sales (GAAP) | $ | 63,080 | $ | 20,347 | $ | 42,733  \nAdjustments:  \nChange in revenue recognition method for Nuuly (a) | 9,072 | —  \nAdjusted net sales (Non-GAAP) | $ | 72,152 | $ | 29,419 | $ | 42,733  \n**Twelve Months Ended**  \n**January 31 ,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**$'s** | **$ Change** | **$'s**  \nNet sales (GAAP) | $ | 235,859 | $ | 106,222 | $ | 129,637  \nAdjustments:  \nChange in revenue recognition method for Nuuly (a) | 9,072 | —  \nAdjusted net sales (Non-GAAP) | $ | 244,931 | $ | 115,294 | $ | 129,637  \n**URBAN OUTFITTERS, INC.**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**  \n_(amounts in thousands, except per share data)_  \n_(unaudited)_  \n**Reconciliation of Total Company Adjusted Gross Profit:**  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**January 31 ,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**$'s** | **% of Net Sales** | **% of Adj.

The Company also changed the period over which it amortizes rental product to align with the change in revenue recognition method. The impact was a reduction in “Net sales” of $9,072 and a reduction in “Cost of sales” of $1,975, resulting in a net reduction of $7,097 in “Gross profit.”  \n(b) Store impairment charges relate to 11 and 15 retail locations during the three and twelve months ended January 31, 2024, respectively, and 15 and 19 retail locations during the three and twelve months ended January 31, 2023, respectively. During the three months ended January 31, 2024, the Company also recorded lease abandonment charges for two store locations which it has committed to cease operations but the lease has not been terminated.  \n(c) The asset impairment charge relates to the write-off of “Property and equipment, net” of the Nuuly Thrift marketplace which the Company has decided to wind down in fiscal 2025.  \n(d) The income tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments is calculated using the estimated tax rate in effect for the respective non-GAAP adjustments.  \nContact: | Oona McCullough  \n---|---  \nExecutive Director of Investor Relations  \n(215) 454-4806  \n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTA1NDI5NyM2MTEwMzg1IzIwMjA5NDk=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YTI0MWYzOWYtYzliNy00MGNhLThkMjgtMDY0ZWRlNDYwMjFlLTEwMzIwMjE=/tiny/Urban-Outfitters-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/b1faab11-73ce-4daf-9e2a-74d8b2837669/small/urban-outfitters-inc-logo.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b1faab11-73ce-4daf-9e2a-74d8b2837669)\n\nSource: Urban Outfitters, Inc.\n\n[ ![](/sites/g/files/knoqqb5936/themes/site/nir_pid512/client/images/printer-icon.png) Print Page ](javascript:void\\(0\\);)\n\n[ ![](/sites/g/files/knoqqb5936/themes/site/nir_pid512/client/images/rss-icon.png) RSS Feed ](/rss-feeds)\n\n[ ![](/sites/g/files/knoqqb5936/themes/site/nir_pid512/client/images/warning-icon.png) Email Alerts ](/financial-news-and-events/email-alerts)\n\n[Urban Outfitters](https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/)[Free People](https://www.freepeople.com/)[Anthropologie](https://www.anthropologie.com/)[Terrain](https://www.shopterrain.com/)[Anthropologie Weddings](https://www.bhldn.com/)[Menus & Venues](https://www.urbn.com/our-brands/menus-venues)[Nuuly](https://www.nuuly.com/)\n\n[Terms of Use](https://www.urbn.com/terms-of-use)[Privacy Policy](https://www.urbn.com/privacy-policy)[Contact](https://www.urbn.com/contact-us)[Sitemap](https://www.urbn.com/site-map)\n\n©2024 Urban Outfitters, Inc.\n"
