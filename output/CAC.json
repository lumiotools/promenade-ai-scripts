We have a well-established reputation for financial stability, growth and community impact and are proud to be the largest publicly traded bank holding company headquartered in Northern New England (NASDAQ: CAC). \n\n  * **About Camden National Bank.** Camden National Bank is a full-service community bank that has been serving customers since 1875 and offers state-of-the art online and mobile banking resources through a network of 57 banking centers and 66 ATMs throughout Maine, as well as lending offices in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. \n  * **About Camden National Wealth Management.** Camden National Wealth Management provides comprehensive wealth management, investment management and trust services to individual and institutional clients. From its offices in Portland, Bangor, and Ellsworth, Camden National Wealth Management serves clients throughout Maine and New England. \n\nOur strategic objective is to strengthen our company through profitable growth that aligns with our commitment to banking and other financial services delivered through our community-based model. This is our key differentiator â€“ we offer the same advanced products and services as our largest competitors, while staying true to our roots as a local genuine Maine bank. **Our History.** We have the ability to adopt new technologies as well as products and services, and leverage those resources to meet customer, regulatory and operational demands. We have undergone significant growth since our inception through strong organic growth and successful acquisitions, along with several key strategic investments. Today, our presence extends from Central, Downeast and the company's home territory of Midcoast Maine through Southern Maine and select markets in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Some of our recent key milestones include: \n\n  * - On December 1, 2016 Camden National Bank combined its subsidiary Acadia Trust N.A. with Camden National Bank and launched a new brand \"Camden National Wealth Management\". The combination has leveraged the technology, capital and resources of both companies to better serve our valuable clients. Additionally, our very capable and highly talented team of experts can now offer clients access to a comprehensive range of deposit and loan products, which has significantly enhanced our wealth management clients' experience \n  * - On October 16, 2015, we acquired SBM Financial, the parent company of The Bank of Maine. The acquisition advanced our strategic goal to increase market share by expanding our presence in Central Maine and entering new markets in the more economically vibrant southern tier of the state. This resulted in the addition of 24 branches and approximately $687 million in deposits, and made Camden National the third largest bank in deposit market share in the State of Maine. \n  * - On October 29, 2012, we acquired 14 branches from Bank of America. This resulted in approximately $300 million in deposits and made Camden National the fourth largest bank in deposit market share in the State of Maine. \n  * - On January 3, 2008, we acquired Union Bankshares Company, a bank holding company with one principal subsidiary, Union Trust Company, a Maine-chartered stock savings bank with its principal office in Ellsworth, Maine. \n  * - On July 19, 2001, we acquired Acadia Trust, N.A. and Gouws Capital Management, Inc. as our principal wealth and investment management subsidiaries. It subsequently purchased the outstanding minority interest of Trust Company of Maine (TCOM) on October 24, 2001. Gouws Capital Management and TCOM were subsequently merged into Acadia Trust, N.A., and the resulting organization now provides a broad array of wealth, investment management, and retirement services. \n  * - On February 4, 2000, we merged our United Bank and Kingfield Savings Bank subsidiaries and created UnitedKingfield Bank (UKB), headquartered in Bangor, Maine. \n  * - On December 20, 1999, we acquired KSB Bancorp, Inc., a publicly held, bank holding company with one principal subsidiary, Kingfield Savings Bank, a Maine-chartered stock savings bank with its principal office in Kingfield, Maine. \n  * - On October 7, 1997, we listed our common shares on the American Stock Exchange using the ticker symbol CAC. \n  * - In December 1995, we merged with UnitedCorp, a bank holding company headquartered in Bangor, Maine, and, as a result, acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of United Bank, with its principal office in Bangor, Maine, and 51% of the outstanding stock of Trust Company of Maine (TCOM). \n  * - In January 1984, the shareholders of Camden National Bank (CNB) exchanged their shares of the Bank for shares of the Company. \n\n**Our Governance.**\n\n  * - Camden National Bank is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) insures its deposits up to the maximum amount permitted by law. \n\n\n\nRead More \n\n# Recent News\n\nLoading ...\n\n# Recent Events\n\n## Q3 Earnings Conference Call\n\nOctober 29, 2024 - 3:00PM ET \n\n[ Webcast ](https://events.q4inc.com/attendee/685424551)\n\n# Latest Documents\n\n![sec-filings](//s1.q4cdn.com/102242684/files/images/irw/sec-filings-bg.jpg)\n\n[ SEC Filings](/sec-filings/sec-filings)\n\n![team](//s1.q4cdn.com/102242684/files/images/irw/team.jpg)\n\n[ Presentations](/news-financial-reports/presentations)\n\n![In_Person](//s1.q4cdn.com/102242684/files/images/irw/in_person.jpg)\n\n[ Quarterly Reports](/news-financial-reports/quarterly-results)\n\n![contact](//s1.q4cdn.com/102242684/files/images/irw/contact.jpg)\n\n[ Annual Reports](/news-financial-reports/annual-reports)\n\n# Contact Information\n\nCamden National Corporation\n\nTwo Elm Street P.O.
