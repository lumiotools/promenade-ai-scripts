(NASDAQ: SAMG) (the “Company” or “Silvercrest”) today reported the results of its operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Business Update**\n\nSupportive markets and improving economic conditions helped Silvercrest’s assets under management (“AUM”) growth during the third quarter, pointing to improved top-line revenue. The firm also saw improved business development results and will report a robust pipeline of new business opportunities. A persistent trend of the market’s recovery since 2022 has been the narrow leadership of Large Cap Growth equities. We noted during our second quarter earnings call that, despite progress in the market, Large Cap Value and Small Cap stocks, had actually declined during that quarter. We have been pleased to see broader company market participation throughout the third quarter and an increase in equities across the market cap spectrum, which benefits Silvercrest’s diversified wealth management business as well as our exposure to the small cap institutional business. The increases during the quarter bode well for future revenue. We are optimistic about securing significant organic net flows over the next two quarters.\n\nSilvercrest’s discretionary AUM increased $1.0 billion during the quarter to $22.6 billion, primarily due to rising markets. This net increase in discretionary AUM – which drives revenue – represents a 5% increase since the second quarter and a year-over-year increase of 10% since the third quarter of 2023. New client accounts and relationships increased during the quarter, led by new Silvercrest Small Cap Opportunity mandates. While we report discretionary outflows during the third quarter, the outflows were revenue neutral to the firm. Overall, total asset flows and market increases were a net positive for the firm and should drive an increase in fourth-quarter revenue. Total AUM at the end of the third quarter was $35.1 billion. Total AUM increased year-over-year from the third quarter of 2023, up 13%. Despite these increases, Silvercrest has been investing in the future growth of the business, which has resulted in higher total compensation and which we have adjusted for on a quarterly basis. As a result, while top-line revenue has increased, most metrics of the business are down due to these higher expenses.\n\nSilvercrest's pipeline of new institutional business opportunities increased during the third quarter by 20% and now stands at $1.2 billion. Importantly, the firm’s pipeline does not yet include potential mandates for our new Global Equity strategy which has a high capacity for significant inflows. Over the past two quarters, we have worked to build the infrastructure to support the team and strategy while undertaking business development. We are optimistic about near-term positive AUM flows and resulting revenue increases to result from the pipeline.\n\nI have consistently mentioned that Silvercrest has never had more business opportunities underway. We have made and will make investments to drive future growth in the business. We expect to make more hires to complement our outstanding professional team and to drive future growth. Silvercrest continues to accrue a higher interim percentage of revenue for compensation for this purpose, and, as mentioned, we will continue to adjust compensation levels to match these important investments in the business and will keep you informed of our plans and the progress of these investments.\n\nWe continue to see substantial new opportunities globally for a firm with our high-quality capabilities, coupled with superior client service. \n\nOn October 30, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share of Class A common stock. The dividend will be paid on or about December 20, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 13, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter** **2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Total Assets Under Management (“AUM”) of $35.1 billion, inclusive of discretionary AUM of $22.6 billion and non-discretionary AUM of $12.5 billion at September 30, 2024.\n  * Revenue of $30.4 million.\n  * U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) consolidated net income and net income attributable to Silvercrest of $3.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively. \n  * Basic and diluted net income per share of $0.24.\n  * Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”)1 of $6.3 million.\n  * Adjusted net income1 of $3.8 million.\n  * Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share1, 2 of $0.27 and $0.26, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe table below presents a comparison of certain GAAP and non-GAAP (“Adjusted”) financial measures and AUM.\n\n**For the Three Months Ended September 30,** | **For the Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**(in thousands except as indicated)** | **2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nRevenue | $ | 30,424 | $ | 29,704 | $ | 91,689 | $ | 88,868  \nIncome before other income (expense), net | $ | 4,457 | $ | 6,519 | $ | 15,670 | $ | 19,788  \nNet income | $ | 3,730 | $ | 5,380 | $ | 13,025 | $ | 15,825  \nNet income margin | 12.3 | % | 18.1 | % | 14.2 | % | 17.8 | %  \nNet income attributable to Silvercrest | $ | 2,252 | $ | 3,216 | $ | 7,917 | $ | 9,505  \nNet income per basic share | $ | 0.24 | $ | 0.34 | $ | 0.83 | $ | 1.01  \nNet income per diluted share | $ | 0.24 | $ | 0.34 | $ | 0.83 | $ | 1.00  \nAdjusted EBITDA1 | $ | 6,346 | $ | 8,000 | $ | 21,031 | $ | 24,297  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin1 | 20.9 | % | 26.9 | % | 22.9 | % | 27.3 | %  \nAdjusted net income1 | $ | 3,801 | $ | 5,136 | $ | 12,921 | $ | 15,055  \nAdjusted basic earnings per share1, 2 | $ | 0.27 | $ | 0.37 | $ | 0.93 | $ | 1.08  \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share1, 2 | $ | 0.26 | $ | 0.36 | $ | 0.89 | $ | 1.05  \nAssets under management at period end (billions) | $ | 35.1 | $ | 31.2 | $ | 35.1 | $ | 31.2  \nAverage assets under management (billions)3 | $ | 34.2 | $ | 31.6 | $ | 34.3 | $ | 30.1  \n  \n_________________\n\n1 | Adjusted measures are non-GAAP measures and are explained and reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures in Exhibits 2 and 3.  \n---|---  \n2 | Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are based on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2024.

The increase was attributable to market appreciation of $4.1 billion partially offset by net client outflows of $2.0 billion. Silvercrest’s total AUM increased by $3.9 billion, or 12.5%, to $35.1 billion at September 30, 2024, from $31.2 billion at September 30, 2023.

This increase was driven by market appreciation partially offset by net client outflows.\n\nTotal expenses increased by $2.8 million, or 12.0%, to $26.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $23.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The increase was primarily attributable to increases in the accrual for bonuses of $0.7 million, severance expense of $0.2 million, equity-based compensation of $0.2 million and salaries and benefits of $0.8 million primarily as a result of merit-based increases. General and administrative expenses increased by $0.9 million, or 13.4%, to $7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

General and administrative expenses increased by $2.1 million, or 11.1%, to $21.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from $19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Our Adjusted Net Income1 was $12.9 million, or $0.93 per adjusted basic share1, 2 and $0.89 per adjusted diluted share1, 2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA1 was $21.0 million or 22.9% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $24.3 million or 27.3% of revenue for the same period in the prior year.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $58.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $70.3 million at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, there was nothing outstanding under our term loan or under our revolving credit facility with City National Bank. \n\nSilvercrest’s total equity was $84.6 million at September 30, 2024. We had 9,503,410 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 4,406,295 shares of Class B common stock outstanding at September 30, 2024.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo provide investors with additional insight, promote transparency and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, we supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a basis consistent with GAAP with Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share, which are non-GAAP financial measures of earnings. These adjustments, and the non-GAAP financial measures that are derived from them, provide supplemental information to analyze our operations between periods and over time. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n  * EBITDA represents net income before provision for income taxes, interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization.\n  * We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA without giving effect to the Delaware franchise tax, professional fees associated with acquisitions or financing transactions, gains on extinguishment of debt or other obligations related to acquisitions, impairment charges and losses on disposals or abandonment of assets and leaseholds, client reimbursements and fund redemption costs, severance and other similar expenses, but including partner incentive allocations, prior to our initial public offering, as an expense. We believe that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring earnings of the Company, taking into account earnings attributable to both Class A and Class B stockholders. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. We believe that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted EBITDA Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring profitability of the Company, taking into account profitability attributable to both Class A and Class B stockholders.\n  * Adjusted Net Income represents recurring net income without giving effect to professional fees associated with acquisitions or financing transactions, losses on forgiveness of notes receivable from our principals, gains on extinguishment of debt or other obligations related to acquisitions, impairment charges and losses on disposals or abandonment of assets and leaseholds, client reimbursements and fund redemption costs, severance and other similar expenses, but including partner incentive allocations, prior to our initial public offering, as an expense. Furthermore, Adjusted Net Income includes income tax expense assuming a blended corporate rate of 26%. We believe that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring income of the Company, taking into account income attributable to both Class A and Class B stockholders. \n  * Adjusted Earnings Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the actual Class A and Class B shares outstanding as of the end of the reporting period for basic Adjusted Earnings Per Share, and to the extent dilutive, we add unvested restricted stock units and non-qualified stock options to the total shares outstanding to compute diluted Adjusted Earnings Per Share. As a result of our structure, which includes a non-controlling interest, we believe that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted Earnings Per Share, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring earnings per share of the Company as a whole as opposed to being limited to our Class A common stock.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call on November 1, 2024, at 8:30 am (Eastern Time) to discuss these results. Hosting the call will be Richard R. Hough III, Chief Executive Officer, and President and Scott A. Gerard, Chief Financial Officer.

(NASDAQ: SAMG) (the “Company” or “Silvercrest”) today reported the results of its operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Business Update**\n\nSupportive markets and improving economic conditions helped Silvercrest’s assets under management (“AUM”) growth during the third quarter, pointing to improved top-line revenue. The firm also saw improved business development results and will report a robust pipeline of new business opportunities. A persistent trend of the market’s recovery since 2022 has been the narrow leadership of Large Cap Growth equities. We noted during our second quarter earnings call that, despite progress in the market, Large Cap Value and Small Cap stocks, had actually declined during that quarter. We have been pleased to see broader company market participation throughout the third quarter and an increase in equities across the market cap spectrum, which benefits Silvercrest’s diversified wealth management business as well as our exposure to the small cap institutional business. The increases during the quarter bode well for future revenue. We are optimistic about securing significant organic net flows over the next two quarters.\n\nSilvercrest’s discretionary AUM increased $1.0 billion during the quarter to $22.6 billion, primarily due to rising markets. This net increase in discretionary AUM – which drives revenue – represents a 5% increase since the second quarter and a year-over-year increase of 10% since the third quarter of 2023. New client accounts and relationships increased during the quarter, led by new Silvercrest Small Cap Opportunity mandates. While we report discretionary outflows during the third quarter, the outflows were revenue neutral to the firm. Overall, total asset flows and market increases were a net positive for the firm and should drive an increase in fourth-quarter revenue. Total AUM at the end of the third quarter was $35.1 billion. Total AUM increased year-over-year from the third quarter of 2023, up 13%. Despite these increases, Silvercrest has been investing in the future growth of the business, which has resulted in higher total compensation and which we have adjusted for on a quarterly basis. As a result, while top-line revenue has increased, most metrics of the business are down due to these higher expenses.\n\nSilvercrest's pipeline of new institutional business opportunities increased during the third quarter by 20% and now stands at $1.2 billion. Importantly, the firm’s pipeline does not yet include potential mandates for our new Global Equity strategy which has a high capacity for significant inflows. Over the past two quarters, we have worked to build the infrastructure to support the team and strategy while undertaking business development. We are optimistic about near-term positive AUM flows and resulting revenue increases to result from the pipeline.\n\nI have consistently mentioned that Silvercrest has never had more business opportunities underway. We have made and will make investments to drive future growth in the business. We expect to make more hires to complement our outstanding professional team and to drive future growth.

The increase was primarily attributable to increases in the accrual for bonuses of $0.7 million, severance expense of $0.2 million, equity-based compensation of $0.2 million and salaries and benefits of $0.8 million primarily as a result of merit-based increases. General and administrative expenses increased by $0.9 million, or 13.4%, to $7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

General and administrative expenses increased by $2.1 million, or 11.1%, to $21.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from $19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

We had 9,503,410 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 4,406,295 shares of Class B common stock outstanding at September 30, 2024.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo provide investors with additional insight, promote transparency and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, we supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a basis consistent with GAAP with Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share, which are non-GAAP financial measures of earnings. These adjustments, and the non-GAAP financial measures that are derived from them, provide supplemental information to analyze our operations between periods and over time. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n  * EBITDA represents net income before provision for income taxes, interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization.\n  * We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA without giving effect to the Delaware franchise tax, professional fees associated with acquisitions or financing transactions, gains on extinguishment of debt or other obligations related to acquisitions, impairment charges and losses on disposals or abandonment of assets and leaseholds, client reimbursements and fund redemption costs, severance and other similar expenses, but including partner incentive allocations, prior to our initial public offering, as an expense. We believe that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring earnings of the Company, taking into account earnings attributable to both Class A and Class B stockholders. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. We believe that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted EBITDA Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring profitability of the Company, taking into account profitability attributable to both Class A and Class B stockholders.\n  * Adjusted Net Income represents recurring net income without giving effect to professional fees associated with acquisitions or financing transactions, losses on forgiveness of notes receivable from our principals, gains on extinguishment of debt or other obligations related to acquisitions, impairment charges and losses on disposals or abandonment of assets and leaseholds, client reimbursements and fund redemption costs, severance and other similar expenses, but including partner incentive allocations, prior to our initial public offering, as an expense. Furthermore, Adjusted Net Income includes income tax expense assuming a blended corporate rate of 26%. We believe that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring income of the Company, taking into account income attributable to both Class A and Class B stockholders. \n  * Adjusted Earnings Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the actual Class A and Class B shares outstanding as of the end of the reporting period for basic Adjusted Earnings Per Share, and to the extent dilutive, we add unvested restricted stock units and non-qualified stock options to the total shares outstanding to compute diluted Adjusted Earnings Per Share. As a result of our structure, which includes a non-controlling interest, we believe that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted Earnings Per Share, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring earnings per share of the Company as a whole as opposed to being limited to our Class A common stock.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call on November 1, 2024, at 8:30 am (Eastern Time) to discuss these results.

          "content": "October 31, 2024\nSilvercrest Asset Management Group Inc.\nReports Q3 2024 Results\nNEW YORK, Oct. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Silvercrest Asset Management Group\nInc. (NASDAQ: SAMG) (the “Company” or “Silvercrest”) today reported the results of its\noperations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nBusiness Update\nSupportive markets and improving economic conditions helped Silvercrest’s assets under\nmanagement (“AUM”) growth during the third quarter, pointing to improved top-line revenue.\nThe firm also saw improved business development results and will report a robust pipeline of\nnew business opportunities. A persistent trend of the market’s recovery since 2022 has been\nthe narrow leadership of Large Cap Growth equities. We noted during our second quarter\nearnings call that, despite progress in the market, Large Cap Value and Small Cap stocks,\nhad actually declined during that quarter. We have been pleased to see broader company\nmarket participation throughout the third quarter and an increase in equities across the\nmarket cap spectrum, which benefits Silvercrest’s diversified wealth management business\nas well as our exposure to the small cap institutional business. The increases during the\nquarter bode well for future revenue. We are optimistic about securing significant organic net\nflows over the next two quarters.\nSilvercrest’s discretionary AUM increased $1.0 billion during the quarter to $22.6 billion,\nprimarily due to rising markets. This net increase in discretionary AUM – which drives\nrevenue – represents a 5% increase since the second quarter and a year-over-year increase\nof 10% since the third quarter of 2023. New client accounts and relationships increased\nduring the quarter, led by new Silvercrest Small Cap Opportunity mandates. While we report\ndiscretionary outflows during the third quarter, the outflows were revenue neutral to the firm.\nOverall, total asset flows and market increases were a net positive for the firm and should\ndrive an increase in fourth-quarter revenue. Total AUM at the end of the third quarter was\n$35.1 billion. Total AUM increased year-over-year from the third quarter of 2023, up 13%.\nDespite these increases, Silvercrest has been investing in the future growth of the business,\nwhich has resulted in higher total compensation and which we have adjusted for on a\nquarterly basis. As a result, while top-line revenue has increased, most metrics of the\nbusiness are down due to these higher expenses.\nSilvercrest's pipeline of new institutional business opportunities increased during the third\nquarter by 20% and now stands at $1.2 billion. Importantly, the firm’s pipeline does not yet\ninclude potential mandates for our new Global Equity strategy which has a high capacity for\nsignificant inflows. Over the past two quarters, we have worked to build the infrastructure to\nsupport the team and strategy while undertaking business development. We are optimistic\nabout near-term positive AUM flows and resulting revenue increases to result from the\npipeline.\nI have consistently mentioned that Silvercrest has never had more business opportunities\nunderway. We have made and will make investments to drive future growth in the business.\nWe expect to make more hires to complement our outstanding professional team and to\ndrive future growth. Silvercrest continues to accrue a higher interim percentage of revenue\nfor compensation for this purpose, and, as mentioned, we will continue to adjust\ncompensation levels to match these important investments in the business and will keep you\ninformed of our plans and the progress of these investments.\nWe continue to see substantial new opportunities globally for a firm with our high-quality\ncapabilities, coupled with superior client service.\nOn October 30, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of\n$0.20 per share of Class A common stock. The dividend will be paid on or about December\n20, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 13, 2024.\nThird Quarter 2024 Highlights\nTotal Assets Under Management (“AUM”) of $35.1 billion, inclusive of discretionary\nAUM of $22.6 billion and non-discretionary AUM of $12.5 billion at September 30,\n2024.\nRevenue of $30.4 million.\nU.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) consolidated net income and\nnet income attributable to Silvercrest of $3.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively.\nBasic and diluted net income per share of $0.24.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”)1\nof $6.3 million.\nAdjusted net income1 of $3.8 million.\nAdjusted basic and diluted earnings per share1, 2 of $0.27 and $0.26, respectively.\nThe table below presents a comparison of certain GAAP and non-GAAP (“Adjusted”)\nfinancial measures and AUM.\nFor the Three Months For the Nine Months\nEnded September 30, Ended September 30,\n(in thousands except as indicated) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue $ 30,424 $ 29,704 $ 91,689 $ 88,868\nIncome before other income (expense), net $ 4,457 $ 6,519 $ 15,670 $ 19,788\nNet income $ 3,730 $ 5,380 $ 13,025 $ 15,825\nNet income margin 12.3% 18.1% 14.2% 17.8%\nNet income attributable to Silvercrest $ 2,252 $ 3,216 $ 7,917 $ 9,505\nNet income per basic share $ 0.24 $ 0.34 $ 0.83 $ 1.01\nNet income per diluted share $ 0.24 $ 0.34 $ 0.83 $ 1.00\nAdjusted EBITDA1 $ 6,346 $ 8,000 $ 21,031 $ 24,297\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin1 20.9% 26.9% 22.9% 27.3%\nAdjusted net income1 $ 3,801 $ 5,136 $ 12,921 $ 15,055\nAdjusted basic earnings per share1, 2 $ 0.27 $ 0.37 $ 0.93 $ 1.08\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share1, 2 $ 0.26 $ 0.36 $ 0.89 $ 1.05\nAssets under management at period end (billions) $ 35.1 $ 31.2 $ 35.1 $ 31.2\nAverage assets under management (billions)3 $ 34.2 $ 31.6 $ 34.3 $ 30.1\n_________________\nAdjusted measures are non-GAAP measures and are explained and reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures in\n1\nExhibits 2 and 3.\n2 Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are\nbased on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding as of September 30,\n2024.

The increase\nwas attributable to market appreciation of $4.1 billion partially offset by net client outflows of\n$2.0 billion. Silvercrest’s total AUM increased by $3.9 billion, or 12.5%, to $35.1 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2024, from $31.2 billion at September 30, 2023. The increase was\nattributable to market appreciation of $5.7 billion partially offset by net client outflows of $1.8\nbillion.\nSilvercrest’s discretionary assets under management increased by $1.0 billion, or 4.6%, to\n$22.6 billion at September 30, 2024, from $21.6 billion at June 30, 2024. The increase was\nattributable to market appreciation of $1.3 billion and net client outflows of $0.3 billion.\nSilvercrest’s total AUM increased by $1.7 billion, or 5.1%, to $35.1 billion at September 30,\n2024, from $33.4 billion at June 30, 2024. The increase was attributable to market\nappreciation of $1.9 billion and net client outflows of $0.2 billion.\nThird Quarter 2024 vs. Third Quarter 2023\nRevenue increased by $0.7 million, or 2.4%, to $30.4 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, from $29.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThis increase was driven by market appreciation partially offset by net client outflows.\nTotal expenses increased by $2.8 million, or 12.0%, to $26.0 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2024, from $23.2 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2023.

We had 9,503,410\nshares of Class A common stock outstanding and 4,406,295 shares of Class B common\nstock outstanding at September 30, 2024.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo provide investors with additional insight, promote transparency and allow for a more\ncomprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and\noperational decision-making, we supplement our consolidated financial statements\npresented on a basis consistent with GAAP with Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share, which are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures of earnings. These adjustments, and the non-GAAP financial measures\nthat are derived from them, provide supplemental information to analyze our operations\nbetween periods and over time. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures\nin addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with\nGAAP.\nEBITDA represents net income before provision for income taxes, interest income,\ninterest expense, depreciation and amortization.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA without giving effect to the Delaware franchise\ntax, professional fees associated with acquisitions or financing transactions, gains on\nextinguishment of debt or other obligations related to acquisitions, impairment charges\nand losses on disposals or abandonment of assets and leaseholds, client\nreimbursements and fund redemption costs, severance and other similar expenses,\nbut including partner incentive allocations, prior to our initial public offering, as an\nexpense. We believe that it is important to management and investors to supplement\nour consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted\nEBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a\nperspective of recurring earnings of the Company, taking into account earnings\nattributable to both Class A and Class B stockholders.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue.\nWe believe that it is important to management and investors to supplement our\nconsolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a\nperspective of recurring profitability of the Company, taking into account profitability\nattributable to both Class A and Class B stockholders.\nAdjusted Net Income represents recurring net income without giving effect to\nprofessional fees associated with acquisitions or financing transactions, losses on\nforgiveness of notes receivable from our principals, gains on extinguishment of debt or\nother obligations related to acquisitions, impairment charges and losses on disposals\nor abandonment of assets and leaseholds, client reimbursements and fund redemption\ncosts, severance and other similar expenses, but including partner incentive\nallocations, prior to our initial public offering, as an expense. Furthermore, Adjusted Net\nIncome includes income tax expense assuming a blended corporate rate of 26%. We\nbelieve that it is important to management and investors to supplement our\nconsolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted Net\nIncome, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a\nperspective of recurring income of the Company, taking into account income\nattributable to both Class A and Class B stockholders.\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the actual\nClass A and Class B shares outstanding as of the end of the reporting period for basic\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share, and to the extent dilutive, we add unvested restricted\nstock units and non-qualified stock options to the total shares outstanding to compute\ndiluted Adjusted Earnings Per Share. As a result of our structure, which includes a\nnon-controlling interest, we believe that it is important to management and investors to\nsupplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this\nmeasure provides a perspective of recurring earnings per share of the Company as a\nwhole as opposed to being limited to our Class A common stock.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call on November 1, 2024, at 8:30 am (Eastern Time)\nto discuss these results.
