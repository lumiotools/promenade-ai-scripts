(Nasdaq: PIRS) (Pieris) today announced they have entered into a definitive merger agreement to combine the companies in an all-stock transaction. The combined company will focus on developing and commercializing Palvella's lead clinical product candidate, QTORIN™ 3.9% rapamycin anhydrous gel (QTORIN™ rapamycin), for the treatment of microcystic lymphatic malformations (microcystic LMs), cutaneous venous malformations, and other serious, functionally debilitating skin diseases driven by the overactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Upon completion of the proposed merger, the combined company will operate under the name Palvella Therapeutics, Inc., will be headquartered in Wayne, PA, and is expected to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq).\n\nIn connection with the proposed merger, Palvella has secured commitments from a syndicate of leading healthcare-dedicated investors in an oversubscribed $78.9 million concurrent private financing co-led by BVF Partners, L.P., an existing investor, and Frazier Life Sciences, a new investor. Additional new investors include Blue Owl Healthcare Opportunities, Nantahala Capital, DAFNA Capital Management, ADAR1 Capital Management, and a healthcare dedicated fund. Existing investors Samsara BioCapital, Petrichor, CAM Capital, Ligand Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: LGND), Integrated Finance Group (an AscellaHealth partner company), BioAdvance, and Gore Range Capital also committed to participate in the financing. The concurrent private financing includes approximately $18.9 million in principal and interest from Palvella convertible notes that will be funded prior to the close and convert into shares of common stock of the combined company. The concurrent private financing is expected to close immediately following the completion of the proposed merger.\n\nThe combined company is expected to have approximately $80.5 million of cash and cash equivalents at closing of the proposed merger and concurrent private financing, inclusive of the net proceeds expected to be received in the concurrent private financing and after deducting operating expenses incurred prior to closing and estimated transaction expenses. These cash resources are expected to be used to advance Palvella's product candidate QTORIN™ rapamycin through multiple clinical data milestones and are expected to fund the combined company's operations into the second half of 2027. The proposed merger and concurrent private financing are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to stockholder approval of both companies, the effectiveness of a registration statement to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to register the shares of Pieris common stock to be issued in connection with the merger, and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Pieris pre-merger stockholders will also be issued a contingent value right (CVR) representing the right to receive payments from proceeds received by the combined company, if any, under Pieris' existing partnership agreements with Pfizer and Boston Pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"We are pleased to announce our merger with Pieris, allowing Palvella to become a publicly traded company and pursue our vision of becoming the leading rare disease company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapies to treat patients suffering from serious, rare genetic skin diseases,\" said Wes Kaupinen, Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Palvella. \"The expected proceeds from the merger and concurrent private financing are expected to fund us through multiple clinical trial milestones, including generating results from the single-arm, baseline-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of QTORIN™ rapamycin for the treatment of microcystic lymphatic malformations, a serious, rare and chronically debilitating genetic disease for which there are currently no FDA-approved therapies.\"\n\n\"This transaction represents Pieris' deep commitment to delivering value to its stockholders by preserving the future potential milestone and royalty streams from our partnered immuno-oncology bispecifics franchise for Pieris legacy stockholders through the CVRs, while also providing the opportunity for upside in an attractive, late-stage, rare disease company,\" said Stephen S. Yoder, President and CEO of Pieris. \"With the anticipated funding and an accomplished management team, we believe Palvella is well-positioned to advance a Phase 3 clinical program with the FDA's Breakthrough, Fast Track, and Orphan Drug Therapy Designations. This transaction is the culmination of a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives, and our board of directors believes that the merger with Palvella is in the best interests of our stockholders.\"\n\n**Palvella's QTORIN** ™**Platform and QTORIN** ™**rapamycin**\n\nPalvella's research team developed QTORIN, a patented and versatile platform designed to generate novel topical therapies that penetrate the deep layers of the skin to locally treat a broad spectrum of serious, rare genetic skin diseases.\n\nQTORIN™ rapamycin is the lead product candidate from Palvella's QTORIN platform. QTORIN™ rapamycin is a novel, patented 3.9% rapamycin anhydrous gel, which aims to harness the potential therapeutic benefits of rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, while minimizing systemic exposure of rapamycin and potential adverse reactions associated with systemic therapy. QTORIN rapamycin is currently under development for the treatment of microcystic LMs, cutaneous venous malformations, and other serious, functionally debilitating skin diseases driven by the overactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. QTORIN™ rapamycin is protected by multiple issued composition patents in the U.S. and Japan and pending patent applications broadly covering anhydrous gel formulations of rapamycin in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.\n\n**QTORIN** ™**Rapamycin for the Treatment of Microcystic LMs**\n\nPalvella initiated research on QTORIN™ rapamycin as a targeted therapy for microcystic LMs in 2017 based on scientific insights implicating abnormal activation of the mTOR pathway in this disease. Microcystic LMs is a rare, chronically debilitating genetic disease caused by dysregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR pathway. The disease is characterized by malformed lymphatic vessels that protrude through the skin and persistently leak lymph fluid (lymphorrhea) and bleed, often leading to recurrent serious infections and cellulitis. The natural history of microcystic LMs is progressive, with symptoms generally worsening during life, including increases in the number and size of malformed vessels that lead to complications and lifetime morbidity. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for the estimated more than 30,000 diagnosed patients with microcystic LMs in the United States.\n\nIn November 2023, based on Phase 2 clinical trial results, Palvella received FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for QTORIN™ rapamycin for microcystic LMs. Palvella previously announced positive topline Phase 2 clinical trial results from the multi-center, open-label study of 12 subjects receiving QTORIN™ rapamycin once-daily for 12-weeks. The Phase 2 clinical trial featured multiple pre-specified efficacy assessments, including clinician and patient global impression assessments as well as assessments of individual clinical manifestations that are important disease burdens for individuals living with microcystic LMs. All participants in the Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated improvements on the Clinician Global Impression of Change scale, with all participants in the study rated as either \"Much Improved\" (n=7, 58%) or \"Very Much Improved\" (n=5, 42%) after 12-weeks of treatment compared to the pre-treatment baseline period. In addition to Breakthrough Therapy Designation, the FDA has granted both Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug Designation to QTORIN™ rapamycin for the treatment of microcystic LMs.\n\nIn February 2023, Palvella had an End of Phase 2 meeting and, in April 2024, a Type B Breakthrough Therapy Designation meeting with FDA regarding the clinical trial program. Palvella considered FDA feedback on study ethics and other considerations related to selection of key study design features, site feedback on study ethics and feasibility, and input from expert regulatory advisors, and Palvella initiated SELVA, a 24-week, pivotal Phase 3, single-arm, baseline-controlled clinical trial of QTORIN™ rapamycin for the treatment of microcystic LMs, in the third quarter of 2024. The study's primary and key secondary endpoints are clinician-reported outcomes and will enroll 40 subjects at leading vascular anomaly centers across the U.S.\n\n**QTORIN™ Rapamycin for the Treatment of Cutaneous Venous Malformations**\n\nPalvella is also developing QTORIN™ rapamycin for the treatment of cutaneous venous malformations. Cutaneous venous malformations are a rare genetic disease that results from overactivation of the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway in the development of the venous network, leading to dilated and dysfunctional veins within the skin. Cutaneous venous malformations cause functional impairment, significantly impact quality of life, and are associated with severe long-term complications. In April 2024, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to QTORIN™ rapamycin for the treatment of venous malformations. Palvella plans to initiate a Phase 2 baseline-controlled clinical trial of QTORIN™ rapamycin for the treatment of cutaneous venous malformations in the second half of 2024.\n\n**About the Proposed Merger**\n\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, Pieris will issue shares of Pieris common stock to pre-merger Palvella stockholders as merger consideration in exchange for the cancellation of shares of capital stock of Palvella, and Palvella will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pieris.\n\nPre-merger Pieris stockholders are expected to own approximately 18% of the combined company and pre-merger Palvella stockholders are expected to own approximately 82% of the combined company, in each case, prior to the issuance of the shares under the concurrent private financing. The percentage of the combined company that pre-merger Palvella stockholders and pre-merger Pieris stockholders will own upon the closing of the merger is subject to further adjustment based on the amount of Pieris' net cash at the time of closing. In connection with the closing of the proposed transactions under the merger agreement, Pieris pre-merger stockholders will also be issued a contingent value right (CVR) representing the right to receive payments from proceeds received by the combined company, if any, under Pieris' existing partnership agreements with Pfizer and Boston Pharmaceuticals, in addition to other potential licensing agreements involving certain of Pieris' legacy assets, as well as certain potential payments related to historical research and development tax credits, which may or may not be realized.\n\nThe transactions contemplated by the merger agreement have been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to approvals by the stockholders of each company, the effectiveness of a registration statement to be filed with the SEC to register the shares of Pieris common stock to be issued in connection with the merger, and other customary closing conditions. Additional information about the transaction will be provided in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed by Pieris with the SEC and will be available at [www.sec.gov](https://pr.report/zyl).\n\n**Management and Organization**\n\nFollowing the merger, the combined company will be led by Wes Kaupinen, Founder and CEO of Palvella, and other members of the Palvella management team. The combined company's board of directors will be comprised of four of the current directors of Palvella's board of directors, and one director designated from Pieris' current board of directors, who is expected to be Christopher Kiritsy, the chair of Pieris' audit committee. Pieris will be renamed \"Palvella Therapeutics, Inc.\"\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nThe companies will host a webcast call and presentation to discuss the proposed transactions, as well as Palvella's pipeline assets on Wednesday, July 24 at 8:30 am ET.

(NASDAQ:PIRS)** today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a 1-for-80 reverse stock split of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001, which will be effective at 5:00 pm Eastern Time on April 22, 2024. The Company's common stock will continue to be traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market on a split-adjusted basis beginning on April 23, 2024, under the Company's existing trading symbol \"PIRS\".\n\nThe reverse stock split is intended to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share of the Company's common stock for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The new CUSIP number following the reverse stock split will be 720795202. The Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Nevada Secretary of State on April 18, 2024 to effect the reverse split.\n\nThe reverse stock split will affect all stockholders uniformly and will not alter the stockholder's percentage ownership interest in the Company, except to the extent that the reverse stock split results in any of the Company's stockholders owning a fractional share as described in more detail below.\n\nThe reverse stock split will reduce the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding from 98,935,025 to approximately 1,236,688. The total authorized number of shares of common stock will be proportionally reduced from 300,000,000 to 3,750,000 shares of common stock. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Each stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of the Company's common stock will instead receive one whole share of common stock.\n\nAs of the effective date of the reverse stock split, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the Company's equity incentive plans and issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants outstanding immediately prior to the reverse stock split will be proportionately affected by the reverse stock split. The exercise prices of the Company's outstanding options and warrants will be adjusted in accordance with their respective terms. Additionally, the respective conversion prices or ratios, as applicable, of the preferred stock of the Company will be adjusted in accordance with the respective terms of the Certificate of Designation for each class of preferred stock. As a result, the number of shares of common stock that may be converted from the preferred stock will be decreased proportionately, so that the aggregate conversion price or conversion ratio, as applicable, payable under the respective Certificate of Designation for the adjusted number of shares of common stock shall be the same as the aggregate conversion price in effect immediately prior to the reverse stock split.\n\nComputershare Trust Company, N.A. (\"Computershare\"), the Company's transfer agent, will act as the exchange agent for the reverse stock split. Computershare will provide instructions to any stockholders with physical certificates regarding the process for exchanging their certificates for split-adjusted shares into \"book-entry form\". Those stockholders with common stock in \"street name\" will receive instructions from their brokers.\n\n_**About Pieris Pharmaceuticals** :_\n\nPieris is a biotechnology company based in Boston, Massachusetts that could potentially be entitled to receive development, regulatory, and sales-based milestones from its 4-1BB bispecifics immuno-oncology assets partnered with Pfizer (formerly Seagen), Boston Pharmaceuticals, and Servier. In addition to the milestone potential, Pieris would be eligible for sales royalties on the same partnered programs if they ultimately are approved for commercialization. The Company is seeking potential acquirers for its remaining preclinical and clinical assets.

Such forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements relating to the timing, consummation, and impact of the reverse stock split, the Company's ability to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement, and the actions of third parties, including Computershare, with respect to the reverse stock split, and our eligibility and potential to receive milestones from our partnered assets.

(NASDAQ:PIRS)** provided a corporate update today announcing a strategy to maximize its ability to capture the potential milestones from its 4-1BB bispecific Mabcalin® (antibody-Anticalin fusion) protein immuno-oncology assets partnered with Pfizer (formerly Seagen), Boston Pharmaceuticals, and Servier. After considering an extensive range of options, the Company's Board of Directors decided to implement this new strategy along with relevant cost-saving measures that are expected to extend the Company's cash runway into 2027.\n\nThe Company's strategic review process has focused on maximizing stockholder value, which includes the preservation of potential milestone and royalty payments the Company is eligible to receive. Management and the Board of Directors evaluated a broad spectrum of potential options, including asset in-licensing, out-licensing, royalty monetization, strategic transactions (including reverse mergers, strategic mergers, and sale), and liquidation. With the assistance of the Company's retained strategic advisor, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, more than 500 companies were contacted regarding a strategic transaction, and the Company underwent a robust process to identify and negotiate with a select number of final candidates. The Company entered into extended exclusivity with one party contemplating a strategic merger, which centered on that party's interest in developing the Company's clinical-stage asset cinrebafusp alfa, but after extensive diligence and negotiations, that counterparty was unable to secure adequate capitalization and offer acceptable terms. The Company ultimately determined that the Company's planned repositioning offers the best opportunity to maximize stockholder value.\n\n\"After an extensive review of strategic alternatives, our Board has determined that retaining the value of future milestone and royalty potential, which could result in up to $75 million of milestone payments during the next several years, as well as potential significant downstream milestones and royalty economics is key to maximizing value for our shareholders,\" said James Geraghty, Chairman of the Board of Directors. \"Implementing a lean business model with substantially reduced operating expenses results in an expected cash runway into at least 2027, while offering risk-mitigated diversification with high quality partners. Finally, on behalf of the full board, I want to express our gratitude to our employees for all their contributions and express to our investors our commitment to maximize shareholder value going forward.\"\n\nIn support of optimizing potential milestones and royalties, the Company's strategic repositioning includes:\n\n  * A plan to maintain strategic capability by maintaining a lean and experienced Board and management profile to actively pursue the Company's strategy and consider strategic options;\n  * The discontinuation of all the Company's research and development efforts, which is expected to be completed by the middle of 2024;\n  * A workforce reduction that affects additional employees and the executive leadership team, expected to be implemented in the second quarter;\n  * A plan to reduce the size of the Company's Board of Directors, to be better aligned with the nature of the Company's continuing operations, also expected to be implemented in the second quarter;\n\n\n\n\"A compelling feature of this new strategy is its planned self-funded nature, offering the opportunity to capture meaningful future milestones and royalties through multiple partnered programs that are fully funded by third parties,\" commented Stephen Yoder, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Yoder continued, \"The new strategy will also facilitate the potential to pursue milestone and royalty monetization agreements with third parties to possibly accelerate cash distributions to shareholders.\"\n\nSince initiating the strategic review in July 2023, the Company implemented several steps, including scaling back operational costs, inclusive of associated headcount reductions, ceasing development of PRS-220 and PRS-400 within its respiratory franchise, and suspending investments associated with co-development of partnered assets. The Company has also eliminated its material long-term obligations through the previously disclosed termination of its lease obligation in Germany, while simultaneously continuing to improve its cash position through the sale of its laboratory and office equipment.\n\nAs previously disclosed, the Company remains eligible to receive contingent milestone and royalty payments across its partnered 4-1BB bispecific Mabcalin protein franchise resulting from its partnerships with Pfizer, Boston Pharmaceuticals, and Servier. More specifically:\n\n  * All partnered programs are fully funded by the respective partner, and there are no further discovery or development obligations for the Company;\n  * The Company may be entitled to aggregate milestones of up to $20 million upon first patient dosed in the phase 2 trials for SGN-BB228, S095012 (formerly PRS-344) and BOS-342, which are all currently in phase 1 clinical development;\n  * The Company may be entitled to aggregate milestones of up to $55 million upon first patient dosed in pivotal clinical trials for SGN-BB228, S095012 (formerly PRS-344) and BOS-342;\n  * Two additional discovery programs with Pfizer that would entitle the company to additional milestones if brought forward into IND-enabling activities;\n  * Total development milestone potential from the three clinical stage assets in single, primary indications could be up to $275 million. Total commercial milestone potential on the same assets, if they are approved, could amount to more than $500 million. A potential additional aggregate amount of up to $160 million in both developmental and commercial milestones exists if these programs are developed in additional indications; and\n  * In addition to the milestone potential, all programs are eligible for royalties from commercial sales ranging from mid-single digits to low double digits.\n\n\n\nIn addition to alliance management activities for the partnered programs above, the Company remains committed to trying to obtain value for its products in prior development, including cinrebafusp alfa, as well as proprietary platform capabilities by pursuing potential out-licensing or sale transactions. In addition to pursuing possible monetization of the projected royalty and milestone payments at attractive valuations, the Company may also, from time-to-time, opportunistically consider other options that it believes may increase stockholder value.\n\nWe can provide no assurance that the Company will receive any potential milestone or royalty payments or on the timing of any such milestone or royalty payments that may become due, or that any potential strategic transactions will occur.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $26.4 million in cash and investments. The Company does not expect to have any future financing requirements to achieve the near-term milestone potential of its partnered programs. The Company may consider cash dividends as and when milestone or other payments are received if the Company determines there is sufficient cash and investments to achieve the Company's near and long-term objectives.\n\n_**About Pieris Pharmaceuticals** :_\n\nPieris is a biotechnology company based in Boston, Massachusetts that could potentially be entitled to receive development, regulatory, and sales-based milestones from its 4-1BB bispecifics immuno-oncology assets partnered with Pfizer (formerly Seagen), Boston Pharmaceuticals, and Servier. In addition to the milestone potential, Pieris would be eligible for sales royalties on the same partnered programs if they ultimately are approved for commercialization. The Company is seeking potential acquirers for its remaining preclinical and clinical assets.

Statements in this press release that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, among other things statement relating to, our expected cash runway and our belief that the Company's strategy is fully funded; any potential future cash dividend; statements relating to the strategy being self-funded; statements relating to potentially considering strategic opportunities; anticipated timing, achievement, and receipt of milestone and/or royalty payments provided for in our collaboration agreements; the potential size of potential milestones and royalties; the timing, impact, and extent of reductions in our workforce and the size of our Board of Directors; the cost-saving potential of our strategic reprioritization and restructuring; the potential for us to out-license or sell our products in prior development, including cinrebafusp alfa, and our proprietary platform capabilities; and the possible monetization of milestone and royalties. Actual results could differ from those projected in any forward-looking statement due to numerous factors. Such factors include, among others, expectations for achievement of contractual milestones; availability of funding sufficient for the Company's foreseeable and unforeseeable operating expenses; our cash runway may be reduced by unanticipated liabilities or decisions to opportunistically pursue strategic opportunities; our ability to be successful in exploring and consummating one or more licensing or other transactions on attractive terms if at all for our proprietary platform capabilities or our products in prior development; our ability to maintain a lean and capable management team and board over time; our actual reductions in spending as compared to anticipated cost reductions; including in collaboration with other parties, the inherent uncertainties associated with developing new products or technologies, such as Anticalin based compounds, our partners' ability to develop, complete clinical trials for, obtain approvals for and commercialize any of our partnered product candidates; our partners ability to achieve expected market share if the drugs are approved and commercialized; uncertainty of overall market size of any of our partnered product candidates; competition in the industry in which we operate; the possibility that our partners may decide not to prioritize or further pursue the programs that we hope to receive milestone and royalty payments under; the fact that data and results from clinical studies may not necessarily be indicative of future results; we may face challenges in continuing to comply with Nasdaq listing standards, such as those relating to minimum price and operating company status; delays or disruptions due to geopolitical issues, including the conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East; and overall market conditions. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release, and we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Investors should consult all of the information set forth herein and should also refer to the risk factor disclosure set forth in the reports and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, available at www.sec.gov, including, without limitation, the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and subsequent filings with the SEC.\n\n**Investor Relations Contact:**\n\nPieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Investors@pieris.com\n\n**SOURCE:** Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nView the original [press release](https://www.accesswire.com/847235/pieris-pharmaceuticals-announces-strategy-to-maximize-partnered-milestone-and-royalty-potential) on accesswire.com \n\nReleased March 27, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/investors/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/investors/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://www.pieris.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/rss)\n\n\n\nHi!

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\n1. Corporate Information\nPieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or the Company or Pieris, was founded in May 2013, and acquired 100% interest in Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH (formerly Pieris AG, a\nGerman company which was founded in 2001) in December 2014. Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, hereinafter collectively Pieris, or the\nCompany, is a biopharmaceutical company that, prior to July of 2023, discovered and developed Anticalin-based drugs to target validated disease pathways in unique and\ntransformative ways. Pieris’ clinical pipeline consists of immuno-oncology, or IO, programs partnered with several major multi-national pharmaceutical companies. Pieris'\ncorporate headquarters is located in Boston, Massachusetts. Pieris also maintains office space in Ismaning, Germany. The Company’s core Anticalin technology and\nplatform was developed in Germany.\nOn July 18, 2023, the Company announced its intention to explore engaging in one or more strategic transactions, including mergers, reverse mergers, acquisitions, other\nbusiness combinations or sales of assets, or other strategic transactions. This decision was related to events that impacted the Company’s inhaled respiratory franchise in\nconnection with AstraZeneca's discontinuation of enrollment of the Phase 2a study for elarekibep, an inhaled IL-4Rα antagonist Anticalin protein to treat uncontrolled\nasthma. As part of this initiative, the Company engaged Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated to serve as its advisor in its review of strategic transactions.\nAlso on July 18, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a reduction in the Company’s workforce by approximately 70%. Since July of 2023, and continuing\nthrough September 30, 2024, the Company took additional steps to reduce its operating footprint including terminating its remaining lease obligations in Germany and\nwinding down its proprietary inhaled respiratory programs. The Company also has opted out and terminated programs where possible to reduce operating costs. Further\nreductions in the workforce have occurred based upon these actions. As a result, the Company has incurred approximately $7.5 million of severance costs and other related\ntermination benefits in 2023 as the service period to earn such benefits is considered complete.\nApproximately $2.4 million of the termination benefits were paid in 2023. The Company expects approximately $4.3 million of the termination benefits to be paid through\nthe end of 2024, with the remainder of termination benefits to be paid in 2025.\nOn March 27, 2024, the Company announced the implementation of a new strategy along with relevant cost-saving measures that are expected to extend its cash runway\ninto at least 2027, while maximizing its ability to capture the potential milestones from its partnered 4-1BB bispecific Mabcalin® protein IO assets. The Company may be\nentitled to aggregate milestones of up to approximately $15.0 million upon first patient dosed in the Phase 2 trials for SGN-BB228 and BOS-342, which are currently in\nPhase 1 clinical development, and up to approximately $40.0 million upon first patient dosed in pivotal clinical trials for SGN-BB228 and BOS-342.\nOn July 23, 2024, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Polo Merger Sub, Inc., or Merger Sub, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger\nAgreement”) with Palvella Therapeutics, Inc., or Palvella, discussed further in Note 11, whereby Merger Sub will merge with and into Palvella, with Palvella continuing as\na wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the surviving corporation of the merger, or the Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the\neffective time of the Merger, (i) each then-outstanding share of Palvella capital stock will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of the Company's\ncommon stock equal to the Exchange Ratio as defined in the Merger Agreement; and (ii) each then-outstanding Palvella stock option to purchase Palvella common stock\nwill be assumed by the Company. Each of the Company and Palvella has agreed to customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement,\nincluding, among others, covenants relating to (1) using reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite approvals of their respective stockholders, (2) non-solicitation of\nalternative acquisition proposals, (3) the conduct of their respective businesses during the period between the date of signing the Merger Agreement and the closing of the\nMerger, (4) the Company using its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the existing listing of the Company's common stock on Nasdaq and the Company causing\nthe shares of the Company's common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq prior to the closing of the Merger and (5) the\nCompany filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and causing to become effective a registration statement to register the shares of the\nCompany's common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger.\nOn August 7, 2024, the Company entered into a Subscription and Investment Representation Agreement with James Geraghty, Chairman of the Company’s Board of\nDirectors, or the Purchaser, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell one (1) share of the Company’s Series F Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, to\nthe Purchaser for $1.00 cash. The sale closed on August 7, 2024. The Series F Preferred Stock have no voting rights other than the right to vote on a proposed amendment to\nthe Company’s amended and restated articles of incorporation to effect an increase in the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock, or the Authorized\nShare Increase Proposal. Each share of Series F Preferred Stock outstanding on the record date entitles the holder thereof to 25,000,000 votes on the Authorized Share\nIncrease Proposal, and all shares of Series F Preferred Stock held by such holder must and will be voted, without further action by such holder, in the same proportion as the\naggregate shares of Pieris common stock (excluding any shares of Pieris common stock that are not voted) that are voted on the Authorized Share Increase Proposal.\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $19.4 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a net loss of $2.9\nmillion and $10.8 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had net losses of $11.4 million and $20.0 million,\nrespectively. The Company has incurred net losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of $326.3 million as of September 30, 2024. Net losses and negative cash\nflows from operations have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company’s stockholders’ equity and working capital. The Company expects to continue\nto incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nThe Company has historically devoted substantially all of its financial resources and efforts to research and development and general and administrative expenses to support\nthe discovery and development of Anticalin-based drugs. Going forward, as part of the Company's previous decision to implement measures to maximize its ability to\ncapture potential milestones from its partnered programs with Pfizer and Boston Pharmaceuticals (all as defined in Note 3 below) and the Company's plan to consummate\nthe potential Merger, subject to stockholder approval, the Company has discontinued all research and development efforts and continues to reduce discretionary\nexpenditures and other fixed or variable personnel costs. The Company believes that its currently available funds will be sufficient to fund its operations through at least the\nnext twelve months from the issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company's belief with respect to its ability to fund operations is based on estimates that\nare subject to risks and uncertainties.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material additions to the significant accounting policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Accordingly, certain\ninformation and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such\nrules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, and disclosures considered necessary for a fair\npresentation of interim period results have been included. Interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results\nthat may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024.\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries were prepared in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been\neliminated.\nEffective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on April 22, 2024, the Company effected a 1-for-80 reverse stock split of its common stock, or the Reverse Split, with any\nfractional shares resulting from the Reverse Split rounded up to the next whole share of common stock. All references to shares of common stock outstanding, average\nnumber of shares outstanding and per share amounts in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been restated to reflect the Reverse Split on a retroactive basis.\n6\nTable of Contents\nThe preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Significant estimates are\nused for, but are not limited to, revenue recognition; deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances; beneficial conversion features; fair value of stock\noptions, preferred stock, and warrants; fair value of assets held for sale; and prepaid and accrued clinical trial expenses. Management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing\nbasis. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially from management’s estimates, judgments and assumptions.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\nThe Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase. All liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the\npurchase date and for which there is an active market are considered to be cash equivalents. The Company’s investments are comprised of money market, asset backed\nsecurities, government treasuries and corporate bonds that are classified as available-for-sale in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB,\nAccounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 320, Investments—Debt and Equity Securities. The Company classifies investments available to fund current operations\nas current assets on its balance sheets.\nAvailable-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Company’s balance\nsheets. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included as a component of other income.\nThe Company reviews investments for other-than-temporary impairment whenever the fair value of an investment is less than the amortized cost and evidence indicates that\nan investment’s carrying amount is not recoverable within a reasonable period of time. To determine whether an impairment is other-than temporary, the Company considers\nits intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’s amortized cost basis.\nEvidence considered in this assessment includes reasons for the impairment, the severity and the duration of the impairment and changes in value subsequent to period end.\nConcentration of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk\nThe Company has no financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements. Financial\ninstruments that subject Pieris to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, investments, and accounts receivable. The Company’s cash, cash\nequivalents, and investments are held in accounts with financial institutions that management believes are creditworthy. The Company’s investment policy includes\nguidelines on the quality of the institutions and financial instruments and defines allowable investments that the Company believes minimize the exposure to concentration\nof credit risk. The Company has not experienced any credit losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds. Accounts\nreceivable historically consisted of amounts due under strategic partnership and other license agreements with major multi-national pharmaceutical companies for which the\nCompany does not obtain collateral.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company is required to disclose information on all assets and liabilities reported at fair value that enables an assessment of the inputs used in determining the reported\nfair values. FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, established a hierarchy of inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of\nobservable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the financial instrument based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that\nreflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument and are developed based on the best information\navailable in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy applies only to the valuation inputs used in determining the reported or disclosed fair value of the financial\ninstruments and is not a measure of the investment credit quality. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\n• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.\n• Level 2 utilizes quoted market prices in markets that are not active, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price\ntransparency.\n• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.\nTo the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.\nAccordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument’s level\nwithin the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents and investments (see Note 5).\nAn entity may elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items\nfor which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in net loss. The Company did not elect to measure any additional financial instruments or other items at fair\nvalue.\n7\nTable of Contents\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at acquisition cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation on property and equipment is calculated using the\nstraight-line method over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets. Maintenance and repairs to these assets are charged to expenses as occurred. As of the period\nended September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any property and equipment recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nIf the criteria in ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant and Equipment are met, a long-lived asset is classified as held for sale. The long-lived asset is reported at the lower of its\ncarrying value or fair value less cost to sell beginning in the period the held for sale criteria are met. The carrying amount of the asset will be adjusted each reporting period\nfor subsequent changes in fair value less costs to sell. A loss is recognized for any subsequent write-down to fair value less cost to sell. A gain is recognized for any\nsubsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognized. Once classified as held for sale, depreciation and\namortization are no longer recorded for any long-lived assets included in the disposal group.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of\nthe assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company evaluates the realizability of its long-lived assets based on profitability and cash flow expectations for the related\nasset. Any write-downs are treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nPieris has entered into several licensing agreements with collaboration partners for the development of Anticalin therapeutics against a variety of targets. The terms of these\nagreements provide for the transfer of multiple goods or services which may include: (i) licenses, or options to obtain licenses, to Pieris’ Anticalin technology and/or specific\nprograms and (ii) research and development activities to be performed on behalf of or with a collaborative partner. Payments to Pieris under these agreements may include\nupfront fees (which include license and option fees), payments for research and development activities, payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones, and\nroyalties on product sales. There are no performance, cancellation, termination or refund provisions in any of the arrangements that could result in material financial\nconsequences to Pieris. As the Company's intellectual property assets are considered to be located in Germany, the Company records all consolidated revenue in its\nsubsidiary, Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH.\nCollaborative Arrangements\nThe Company considers the nature and contractual terms of an arrangement and assesses whether the arrangement involves a joint operating activity pursuant to which it is\nan active participant and exposed to significant risks and rewards with respect to the arrangement. If the Company is an active participant and exposed to the significant\nrisks and rewards with respect to the arrangement, it accounts for these arrangements pursuant to ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, or ASC 808, and applies a\nsystematic and rational approach to recognize revenue. The Company classifies payments received as revenue and payments made as a reduction of revenue in the period in\nwhich they are earned. Revenue recognized under a collaborative arrangement involving a participant that is not a customer is presented as Collaboration Revenue in the\ncondensed consolidated statement of operations.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the\nconsideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for these goods and services. To achieve this core principle, the Company applies the following five\nsteps: 1) identify the customer contract; 2) identify the contract’s performance obligations; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the\nperformance obligations; and 5) recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company evaluates all promised goods and services within a customer contract and determines which of such goods and services are separate performance obligations.\nThis evaluation includes an assessment of whether the good or service is capable of being distinct and whether the good or service is separable from other promises in the\ncontract. In assessing whether promised goods or services are distinct, the Company considers factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual\nproperty and the capabilities of the customer to develop the intellectual property on their own or whether the required expertise is readily available.\n8\nTable of Contents\nLicensing arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the promised goods or services, which often include licenses, research and development services and governance\ncommittee services, are distinct or whether they must be accounted for as part of a combined performance obligation. If the license is considered not to be distinct, the\nlicense would then be combined with other promised goods or services as a combined performance obligation. If the Company is involved in a governance committee, it\nassesses whether its involvement constitutes a separate performance obligation. When governance committee services are determined to be separate performance\nobligations, the Company determines the fair value to be allocated to this promised service.\nCertain contracts contain optional and additional items, which are considered marketing offers and are accounted for as separate contracts with the customer if such option\nis elected by the customer, unless the option provides a material right which would not be provided without entering into the contract. An option that is considered a\nmaterial right is accounted for as a separate performance obligation.\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. A\ncontract may contain variable consideration, including potential payments for both milestone and research and development services. For certain potential milestone\npayments, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration by using the most likely amount method. In making this assessment, the Company evaluates factors\nsuch as the clinical, regulatory, commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone. Each reporting period the Company re-evaluates the probability\nof achievement of such variable consideration and any related constraints. The Company will include variable consideration, without constraint, in the transaction price to\nthe extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable\nconsideration is subsequently resolved. For potential research and development service payments, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration by using the\nexpected value method, including any approved budget updates arising from additional research or development services.\nIf the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple\nperformance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis unless a portion of the\ntransaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance\nobligation.\nThe Company allocates the transaction price based on the estimated standalone selling price of the underlying performance obligations or, in the case of certain variable\nconsideration, to one or more performance obligations. The Company must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price for each\nperformance obligation identified in the contract. The Company utilizes key assumptions to determine the stand-alone selling price, which may include other comparable\ntransactions, pricing considered in negotiating the transaction and the estimated costs to complete the respective performance obligation. Certain variable consideration is\nallocated specifically to one or more performance obligations in a contract when the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the performance\nobligation and the resulting amounts allocated to each performance obligation are consistent with the amount the Company would expect to receive for each performance\nobligation.\nWhen a performance obligation is satisfied, revenue is recognized for the amount of the transaction price, excluding estimates of variable consideration that are constrained,\nthat is allocated to that performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort\nrequired under an arrangement and the period over which the Company is expected to complete its performance obligations under an arrangement.\nFor performance obligations consisting of licenses and other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to\ndetermine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for\npurposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the\nmeasure of performance and related revenue recognition. If the license to the Company’s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance\nobligations identified in the arrangement, the Company will recognize revenue from non-refundable, up-front fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to\nthe customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license.\nRevenue recognized under an arrangement involving a participant that is a customer is presented as Customer Revenue.\nMilestones and Royalties\nThe Company aggregates milestones into four categories: (i) research milestones, (ii) development milestones, (iii) commercial milestones, and (iv) sales milestones.\nResearch milestones are typically achieved upon reaching certain success criteria as defined in each agreement related to developing an Anticalin protein against the\nspecified target. Development milestones are typically reached when a compound reaches a defined phase of clinical research or passes such phase, or upon gaining\nregulatory approvals. Commercial milestones are typically achieved when an approved pharmaceutical product reaches the status for commercial sale, including regulatory\napproval. Sales milestones are certain defined levels of net sales by the licensee, such as when a product first achieves global sales or annual sales of a specified amount.\nThere is uncertainty that the events to obtain the research and development milestones will be achieved given the nature of clinical development and the stage of the\nCompany’s technology. The Company has thus determined that all research and development milestones will be constrained until it is deemed probable that a significant\nrevenue reversal will not occur. For revenues from research and development milestones, payments will be recognized consistent with the recognition pattern of the\nperformance obligation to which they relate.\n9\nTable of Contents\nFor arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and for which the license is deemed to be the predominant\nitem to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or\nall of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Commercial milestones and sales royalties are determined by sales or usage-based thresholds\nand will be accounted for under the royalty recognition constraint as constrained variable consideration.\nThe Company calculates the maximum amount of potential milestones achievable under each collaboration agreement and discloses such potential future milestones for all\ncurrent collaborations using such a maximum calculation.\nContract Balances\nThe Company recognizes a contract asset when the Company transfers goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due,\nexcluding any amounts presented as a receivable (i.e., accounts receivable). A contract asset is an entity’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the\nentity has transferred to a customer. The contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue) primarily relate to contracts where the Company has received payment but has not yet\nsatisfied the related performance obligations.\nIn the event of an early termination of a collaboration agreement, any contract liabilities would be recognized in the period in which all Company obligations under the\nagreement have been fulfilled.\nCosts to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract with a Customer\nCertain costs to obtain customer contracts, including success-based fees paid to third-party service providers, and costs to fulfill customer contracts are capitalized in\naccordance with FASB ASC Topic 340, Other Assets and Deferred Costs, or ASC 340. These costs are amortized to expense on a systemic basis that is consistent with the\ntransfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. The Company will expense the amortization of costs to obtain customer contracts to general and\nadministrative expense and costs to fulfill customer contracts to research and development expense.\nGovernment Grants\nThe Company recognizes grants from governmental agencies when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to the grant\narrangement and the grant will be received. The Company evaluates the conditions of each grant as of each reporting period to evaluate whether the Company has reached\nreasonable assurance of meeting the conditions of each grant arrangement and that it is expected that the grant will be received as a result of meeting the necessary\nconditions. Grants are recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognizes the\nrelated costs for which the government grant is intended to compensate. Specifically, grant income related to research and development costs is recognized as such expenses\nare incurred. Grant income is included as a separate caption within Other income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nLeases\nIn accordance with accounting standards update, or ASU, No. 2016-2, Leases (Topic 842), or ASC 842, and for each of the Company’s leases, the following is recognized:\n(i) a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset\nthat represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement\ndate.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company’s contracts are determined to contain a lease within the scope of ASC 842 when all of the\nfollowing criteria based on the specific circumstances of the arrangement are met: (1) there is an identified asset for which there are no substantive substitution rights; (2)\nthe Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the identified asset; and (3) the Company has the right to direct the use of the identified\nasset.\nAt the commencement date, operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of future lease payments over the\nexpected lease term. The Company’s lease agreements do not provide an implicit rate. As a result, the Company utilizes an estimated incremental borrowing rate to discount\nlease payments, which is based on the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow a similar amount on a collateralized basis over a similar term and based on\nobservable market data points. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or lease incentives received. Operating\nlease cost is recognized over the expected term on a straight-line basis.\nThe Company typically only includes an initial lease term in its assessment of a lease agreement. Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company’s assessment\nunless there is reasonable certainty that the Company will renew. The expected lease term includes noncancellable lease periods and, when applicable, periods covered by\nan option to extend the lease if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option, as well as periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is\nreasonably certain not to exercise that option.\nAssumptions made by the Company at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events, including a lease modification. A lease modification\nresults in a separate contract when the modification grants the lessee an additional right of use not included in the original lease and when lease payments increase\ncommensurate with the standalone price for the additional right of use. When a lease modification results in a separate contract, it is accounted for in the same manner as a\nnew lease.\nWhen a lease is terminated in its entirety, the corresponding lease liability and right-of-use asset are adjusted to zero. Any difference between the carrying amounts of the\nright-of-use asset and lease liability as compared to the termination payment is recorded in the statement of operations as a gain or loss.\n10\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, that requires a public entity to\ndisclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s\nprofit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. It requires a public entity to also disclose the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The\nASU will be effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The\namendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the effect on the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements.\nOn December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, or ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The standard requires disaggregated information about\na reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed\nincome tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. ASU 2023-09 applies to all entities subject to income taxes. For public business entities,\nthe new requirements will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. For entities other than public business entities, the requirement will be\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n3. Revenue\nGeneral\nThe Company has not generated revenue from product sales. The Company has generated revenue from contracts with customers (option, license and collaboration\nagreements), which include upfront payments for licenses or options to obtain licenses, payments for research and development services and milestone payments.\nThe Company recognized revenue from the following strategic partnerships and other license agreements (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September\n30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nPfizer (formerly Seagen) $ — $ 9,179 $ 6 $ 14,088\nAstraZeneca — 3,909 — 8,399\nServier — 3,951 47 3,846\nGenentech — — — 12,697\nBoston Pharmaceuticals — 2,481 — 2,481\nTotal Revenue $ — $ 19,520 $ 53 $ 41,511\nAs of September 30, 2024, under the Company’s existing strategic partnerships and other license agreements, the Company could receive the following potential milestone\npayments (in millions):\nResearch,\nDevelopment,\nRegulatory &\nCommercial\nMilestones Sales Milestones\nPfizer (formerly Seagen) $ 759 $ 450\nBoston Pharmaceuticals 85 265\nTotal potential milestone payments $ 844 $ 715\nStrategic Partnerships\nGenentech\nOn May 19, 2021, the Company and Genentech, Inc., or Genentech, entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Genentech Agreement, to\ndiscover, develop and commercialize locally delivered respiratory and ophthalmology therapies that leverage the Company’s proprietary Anticalin technology. Upon signing\nthe Genentech Agreement, Genentech paid the Company a $20 million upfront fee.\nUnder the terms of the Genentech Agreement, the Company was responsible for discovery and preclinical development of two initial programs. In April and May 2023,\nGenentech and the Company decided to discontinue the discovery-stage programs in ophthalmology and respiratory, respectively, for scientific reasons. Pursuant to this\ndecision, the material right performance obligations related to the target swaps for these programs also expired. Based on these decisions, there are no more active\nperformance obligations remaining under the collaboration and the Company recognized all remaining revenue, or $12.5 million, under the collaboration in the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2023.\n11\nTable of Contents\nGenentech also had options to select two additional programs with the payment of a fee, which expired in May 2024. With the expiration of these options and no programs\nactive or ongoing, the Genentech Agreement also expired.\nBoston Pharmaceuticals\nOn April 24, 2021, the Company and BP Asset XII, Inc., or Boston Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Boston Pharma Holdings, LLC, entered into an Exclusive Product\nLicense Agreement, or the BP Agreement, to develop BOS-342, also referred to as PRS-342, a 4-1BB/GPC3 preclinical immuno-oncology Mabcalin® (antibody-Anticalin\nfusion) protein.\nUnder the terms of the BP Agreement, Boston Pharmaceuticals exclusively licensed worldwide rights to BOS-342. The Company received an upfront payment and is further\nentitled to receive development, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments, tiered royalties up to low double-digits on sales of BOS-342 and a percentage of\nconsideration received by Boston Pharmaceuticals in the event of a sublicense of a program licensed under the BP Agreement or a change of control of Boston\nPharmaceuticals.\nThe Company recognized the full transaction price as revenue in 2021 and has no remaining obligations. In August 2023, the first patient was dosed in the Boston\nPharmaceuticals sponsored Phase 1/2 study of PRS-342/BOS-342 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for which the Company received a milestone payment of $2.5\nmillion.\nPfizer (formerly Seagen)\nOn February 8, 2018, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement, and a non-exclusive Anticalin platform\ntechnology license agreement, or the Pfizer Platform License, and together with the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement, the Pfizer Agreements, with Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer,\npursuant to which the parties agreed to develop multiple targeted bispecific IO treatments for solid tumors and blood cancers.\nUnder the terms of the Pfizer Agreements, the companies agreed to pursue multiple antibody-Anticalin fusion proteins during the research phase. The Pfizer Agreements\nprovide Pfizer an option to select up to three programs for further development, which Pfizer did, and Pfizer is responsible for developing, funding and commercializing\neach of these programs.\nOn March 24, 2021, the Company entered into a Second Pfizer Amendment (formerly the Second Seagen Amendment), to amend the existing immuno-oncology\ncollaboration agreement relating to joint development and commercial rights for one program in the alliance. Under the Second Pfizer Amendment, the Company retains a\nco-promotion option in the United States for one program, while Pfizer remains solely responsible for the development and overall commercialization of that program. The\nCompany will also be entitled to increased royalties from that program if it chooses to exercise the co-promotion option.\nUnder the Pfizer Agreements, the Company is eligible to receive other various research, development, commercial and sales milestones. There is uncertainty that the events\nto obtain the research and development milestones will be achieved given the nature of clinical development and the stage of the Company’s technology. The Company has\nthus determined that all research and development milestones will be constrained until it is deemed probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur, with the\nexception of the $5.0 million milestone as described in the following paragraph.\nIn January 2023, the Company achieved a milestone for the first program in the Pfizer collaboration for $5.0 million. The Company evaluated the recognition of the\nmilestone under ASC 606 and concluded that the constraints on the milestone no longer existed as of December 31, 2022 and therefore recorded the full $5.0 million as\nrevenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIn September 2023, Pfizer and the Company entered into an amendment of the Second Pfizer Amendment that provides Pfizer with collaboration product licenses and no\nchanges to the amounts achievable under the collaboration agreement. The effect of the September 2023 amendment was to transfer responsibility for substantially all\nactivities previously performed by the Company to Pfizer. Subsequently, in December 2023, the transfer of the programs was fully approved by the combined joint steering\ncommittee. Accordingly, the Company recognized revenue of approximately $10.1 million for the delivery on its performance obligations related to the two programs for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. With this amendment, the Company has satisfied all remaining obligations under the collaboration.\nAstraZeneca\nOn May 2, 2017, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement, and a non-exclusive Anticalin platform\ntechnology license agreement, or AstraZeneca Platform License, and together with the AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement, the AstraZeneca Agreements, with\nAstraZeneca AB, or AstraZeneca, which became effective on June 10, 2017, following expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements\nAct of 1976.\n12\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to elarekibep (formerly known as PRS-060/AZD1402), or the AstraZeneca Lead Product, the Company and AstraZeneca agreed to collaborate, under the\noriginal terms of the AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement, to progress four additional novel Anticalin proteins against undisclosed targets for respiratory diseases, or the\nAstraZeneca Collaboration Products, and together with the AstraZeneca Lead Product, the AstraZeneca Products. The first two discovery-stage programs were discontinued\nin 2022. The third discovery-stage program was discontinued in the second quarter of 2023, which led to recognition of $4.0 million of revenue in that same quarter.\nIn June 2023, based on non-clinical safety findings in a 13-week toxicology study of elarekibep in non-human primates previously disclosed by the Company, AstraZeneca\nnotified us of its decision to discontinue and cease dosing in the ongoing clinical studies of elarekibep. There was no effect to revenue as a result of the discontinuation of\nthis program.\nOn July 17, 2023, as a result of the non-clinical safety finding in the 13-week toxicology study of elarekibep in non-human primates, AstraZeneca notified the Company of\nits intention to terminate the AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement and the AstraZeneca Platform License, effective October 15, 2023. As a result of this, the remaining\namount of current deferred revenue, or $3.5 million, related to the fourth discovery-stage program was recognized in revenue in the third quarter of 2023. With the\ntermination of the AstraZeneca Agreements, there are no more active programs or performance obligations related to the collaboration. Following the termination date, the\nCompany determined that it would not continue development of the programs under the AstraZeneca Agreements.\nServier\nIn 2017, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or Servier Collaboration Agreement, and a non-exclusive Anticalin platform license agreement, or\nServier Platform License Agreement, and together with the Servier Collaboration Agreement, the Servier Agreements, with Les Laboratoires Servier and Institut de\nRecherches Internationales Servier, or Servier, pursuant to which the Company and Servier agreed to initially pursue five bispecific therapeutic programs. The intention of\nthe collaboration and defined programs was to combine antibodies from the Servier portfolio with one or more Anticalin proteins based on the Company’s proprietary\nplatform to generate innovative IO bispecific drug candidates.\nSince inception, four of the five initially committed programs have been discontinued by Servier. The Company does not presently intend to continue development of the\nfour discontinued programs but retains full rights to advance the development and commercialization of those products on a world-wide basis in the future.\nIn July 2023, the Company notified Servier of its decision to opt out of co-development and commercialization of S095012, also referred to as PRS- 344, a 4- 1BB/PD- L1\nbispecific Mabcalin protein, in the United States. With the decision to opt out of co-development of S095012, the Company recognized the remaining revenue under the\ncollaboration, or $4.7 million, in 2023 and there are no more active co-development programs under the collaboration.\nOn June 28, 2024, Servier provided the Company with a written notice of termination of the Servier Collaboration Agreement. Pursuant to the Servier Platform License\nAgreement, the Servier Platform License Agreement terminates upon termination of the Servier Collaboration Agreement. The Servier Collaboration Agreement and Servier\nPlatform License Agreements will terminate effective December 27, 2024, or 180 days from the date on which Servier notified the Company of its intent to terminate both\nagreements.\nWith this notice, Servier will discontinue and cease dosing in the Phase 1 clinical study of S095012. Servier's decision to terminate both agreements was based on a\npotential safety concern in S095012 Phase 1 clinical studies. The Company does not intend to pursue any further development of S095012.\nContract Balances\nThe Company receives payments from its collaboration partners based on payments established in each contract. Upfront payments and fees are recorded as deferred\nrevenue upon receipt or when due until such time as the Company satisfies its performance obligations under each arrangement. A contract asset is a conditional right to\nconsideration in exchange for goods or services that the Company has transferred to a customer. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when the Company’s right is\nunconditional.\nThere were no additions to deferred revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no reductions to deferred revenue for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and reductions to deferred revenue were $17.1 million and $38.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023 respectively.\n4. Grant Income\nOne of the Company's proprietary respiratory assets, PRS-220, an oral inhaled Anticalin protein targeting connective tissue growth factor, or CTGF, was being developed as\na local treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and other forms for fibrotic lung disorders. In June 2021, the Company received a €14.2 million (approximately $17.0\nmillion) grant from the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Regional Development and Energy (the Bavarian Grant) supporting research and development for post-\nacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) pulmonary fibrosis, or PASC-PF, also known as post-COVID-19 syndrome pulmonary fibrosis, or long COVID.\nThe Bavarian Grant provided partial reimbursement for qualifying research and development activities on PRS-220, including drug manufacturing costs, activities and costs\nto support an IND filing, and Phase 1 clinical trials costs. The Bavarian Grant provided reimbursement of qualifying costs incurred through December 2023, with\nsubmission for reimbursements allowed through February 2024, which was successfully completed by the Company. As of September 30, 2024, all reimbursable amounts\nsubject to the Bavarian Grant have been received by the Company.\n13\nTable of Contents\n5.

The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income and market-based approaches\nand observable market inputs to determine value. The Company validates the prices provided by its third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and\nobtaining market values from other pricing sources, as needed. After completing its validation procedures, the Company did not adjust any fair value measurements\nprovided by the pricing services as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company recorded no realized gains or losses from the maturity of available-for-sale securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\nrecorded no realized gains or losses and $0.1 million in realized losses from the maturity of available-for-sale securities during the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023, respectively.\n6.

The sale of the assets was deemed probable as a result of management's decision, including the\nestimated timing of sale which was determined to be within a year of the decision. As a result of this decision, the property and equipment met the criteria for held-for-sale\naccounting.\nThe net book value of its long-lived assets, as of December 31, 2023 represents the Company's best estimate of the fair value less costs to sell that could be recovered\nrelated to lab and office equipment and furniture as part of the Company's initiative to monetize all remaining assets. As the estimated selling price less costs to sell are\nbased primarily on unobservable inputs as they relate to the location and condition of the specific lab equipment and furniture, they are classified in Level 3 in the fair value\nhierarchy. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company conducted an auction, with the assistance of a third party, of its assets held for sale. After the\nconclusion of the auction, the Company recovered the total net book value of the assets held for sale and recorded a gain on the sale of the assets of $0.2 million within\n\"Other income (loss)\" in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n7.

Net Loss per Share\nBasic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock\nequivalents. Diluted net loss per share is calculated by adjusting weighted average shares outstanding for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents outstanding for the\nperiod, determined using the treasury-stock and if-converted methods. For purposes of the diluted net loss per share calculation, preferred stock, stock options and warrants\nare considered to be common stock equivalents but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share, as their effect would be anti-dilutive for all periods\npresented.\nA reconciliation of basic and diluted net loss per share is as follows (in thousands, except for per share data):\nThree Months Ended September\n30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (2,887) $ (10,752) $ (11,369) $ (19,959)\nBasic weighted average common shares outstanding 1,320 1,236 1,285 1,089\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding 1,320 1,236 1,285 1,089\nBasic net loss per share $ (2.19) $ (8.70) $ (8.84) $ (18.33)\nDiluted net loss per share $ (2.19) $ (8.70) $ (8.84) $ (18.33)\nAs of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and as calculated using the treasury stock method, approximately 0.5 million of weighted average shares, were excluded from the\ncalculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding as their effect was antidilutive.\nThis amount includes approximately 0.1 million of warrants to purchase one share of the Company’s common stock with an exercise price of $568.00. These were issued\nwith a five-year term in connection with the 2019 private placement financing and expired in November of 2024.\n9.

The 2023 ESPP provides\neligible employees with the opportunity to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a discount, on a tax-favored basis, through regular payroll deductions in\ncompliance with federal tax regulations. The Company has reserved 9,375 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2023 ESPP.\n15\nTable of Contents\nOpen Market Sales Agreements\nIn August 2021, the Company established an at-the-market program, or ATM Program, under a sales agreement with Jefferies LLC, pursuant to which the Company may\noffer and sell shares of its common stock from time to time, up to an aggregate amount of gross sales proceeds of $50.0 million. The ATM Program is offered under a shelf\nregistration statement on Form S-3 that was filed with and declared effective by the SEC in August 2021. In November 2022, the sales agreement was amended to provide\nfor an increase in the aggregate offering amount, such that under the ATM Program, as amended, the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock, from time to\ntime, up to an aggregate amount of gross sales proceeds of $75.0 million.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not sell any shares under the ATM Program. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the\nCompany sold 24.3 million shares for gross proceeds of $20.3 million under the ATM Program at an average stock price of $0.84 per share.\nThe Company is currently subject to the SEC general instructions of Form S-3 known as the “baby shelf rules.” Under these instructions, the amount of funds the Company\ncan raise through primary public offerings of securities in any 12-month period using its registration statement on Form S-3 is limited to one-third of the aggregate market\nvalue of the shares of the Company’s common stock held by non-affiliates. Therefore, the Company will be limited in the amount of proceeds it is able to raise by selling\nshares of its common stock using its Form S-3, including under the ATM Program, until such time as its public float exceeds $75 million.\n10. Leases\nThe Company generally conducts its operational functions in the United States remotely.\nIn October 2018, Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH entered into a lease for office and laboratory space located in Hallbergmoos, Germany, or the Hallbergmoos Lease. The\nHallbergmoos Lease was subsequently amended in May 2019 and February 2020. The Hallbergmoos Lease, as amended, provided an initial rental term of 12.5 years, and a\nrental area of approximately 105,000 square feet.\nIn December 2023, Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH entered into an agreement to terminate the Hallbergmoos Lease, or the Lease Termination Agreement. Under the terms of\nthe Lease Termination Agreement, Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH terminated the Hallbergmoos Lease in exchange for a termination fee of approximately €9.7 million,\nand vacated the majority of the premises by December 31, 2023, while continuing to occupy, through June 2024, a limited portion of the office space and using another\nportion of the former lab space to house its assets being held for sale.\nThere was no cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of the lease liabilities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash paid for amounts\nincluded in the measurement of the lease liabilities was $0.5 million and $1.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes operating lease costs included in operating expenses (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September\n30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease costs $ — $ 280 $ — $ 862\nVariable lease costs (1) — 98 — 476\nTotal lease cost $ — $ 378 $ — $ 1,338\n(1) Variable lease costs include certain additional charges for operating costs, including insurance, maintenance, taxes, utilities, and other costs incurred, which are billed\nbased on both usage and as a percentage of the Company’s share of total square footage.\n11. Merger Agreement with Palvella Therapeutics, Inc.\nOn July 23, 2024, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Merger Sub entered into the Merger Agreement with Palvella whereby Merger Sub will merge with and\ninto Palvella, with Palvella continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the surviving corporation of the Merger. If the Merger is completed, the business\nof Palvella will continue as the business of the combined organization. Consummation of the Merger is contingent on certain closing conditions as identified in the Merger\nAgreement, including among others, (1) approval by the Company's stockholders of the Required Voting Proposals, as defined in the Merger Agreement, (2) approval by the\nPalvella stockholders of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (3) Nasdaq’s approval of the listing of the shares of the Company's common stock to be issued in connection\nwith the Merger, (4) the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, and (5) consummation of the PIPE Financing, all in accordance with the terms of the Purchase\nAgreement.\nEach party’s obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to other specified customary conditions, including the representations and warranties of the other party\nbeing true and correct as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the closing date of the Merger, generally subject to an overall material adverse effect qualification,\nthe performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement required to be performed on or prior to the date of the closing of\nthe Merger and the absence of any material adverse effect affecting the other party that is continuing on the closing date.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, as defined in the Merger Agreement, (i) each then-outstanding share of Palvella capital\nstock will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of the Company's common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio as defined in the Merger Agreement; and\n(ii) each then-outstanding Palvella stock option to purchase Palvella common stock will be assumed by the Company, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Merger\nAgreement. In connection with the Merger, and contingent on the approval of the Company's stockholders, the Company intends to amend the amended and restated articles\nof incorporation of the Company to increase the number of shares of authorized common stock, change the corporate name of the Company to “Palvella Therapeutics, Inc.”\nand adopt a new 2024 equity incentive plan. The provisions for calculating the Exchange Ratio are set forth in the Merger Agreement, and assume a valuation for Palvella\nequal to $95 million, and a valuation for Pieris equal to $21 million, provided, that (a) if Pieris’ net cash as of the closing is greater than $11 million, then Pieris’ valuation\nwill be adjusted upwards on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the difference of: (i) Pieris' net cash, minus (ii) $11 million, and (b) if Pieris’ net cash is less than $11 million, then\nPieris’ valuation will be adjusted downwards on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the difference of: (i) $11 million, minus (ii) Pieris’ net cash.\nFor the purposes of calculating the Exchange Ratio for each of Pieris and Palvella, the total number of shares of capital stock of such company issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the Merger, expressed on a fully-diluted and as-converted to common stock basis, calculated using the treasury stock method, will be included in the\ncalculation of the Exchange Ratio. Shares of Pieris common stock underlying Pieris stock options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price\nper share of less than the volume weighted average closing trading price of a share of Pieris common stock on the Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending five\ntrading days immediately prior to the date upon which the Merger occurs will be deemed to be outstanding, calculated using the treasury stock method, and all shares of\nPalvella common stock underlying outstanding Palvella stock options, warrants and other derivative securities will be deemed to be outstanding, calculated using the\ntreasury stock method, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, on a pro forma basis, it is expected that upon the closing of the Merger, pre-Merger Company stockholders will own\napproximately 18% of the combined company and pre-Merger Palvella stockholders will own approximately 82% of the combined company, based on the number of shares\nof the Company's common stock expected to be issued in connection with the Merger, in each case, prior to the issuance of shares under a proposed concurrent private\nfinancing. The percentage of the combined company that pre-merger Palvella stockholders and pre-merger Pieris stockholders will own upon the closing of the merger is\nsubject to further adjustment based on the amount of Pieris' net cash at the time of closing.\nIn connection with the Merger, Pieris will seek the approval or ratification, as applicable, by its stockholders of, among other things, (a) the issuance of the shares of Pieris\ncommon stock issuable in connection with the Merger under the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, (b) amendments to\nthe amended and restated articles of incorporation of Pieris to (i) increase the number of shares of authorized common stock and (ii) change the name of Pieris to “Palvella\nTherapeutics, Inc.” (the approvals described in clause (a) and (b), the “Required Pieris Voting Proposals”) and (c) the adoption of a new 2024 equity incentive plan, in each\ncase, as described in the Merger Agreement.\nEach of Pieris and Palvella has agreed to customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants relating to\n(1) using reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite approvals of their respective stockholders, (2) non-solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals, (3) the conduct of\ntheir respective businesses during the period between the date of signing the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, (4) Pieris using its commercially reasonable\nefforts to maintain the existing listing of the Pieris common stock on Nasdaq and Pieris causing the shares of Pieris common stock to be issued in connection with the\nMerger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq prior to the closing of the Merger and (5) Pieris filing with the SEC and causing to become effective a registration statement to\nregister the shares of Pieris common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger, or Registration Statement. The Registration Statement related to the Merger was\nincluded on the Form S-4 filed by the Company with the SEC on August 9, 2024, and was subsequently amended on September 23, 2024, October 15, 2024, November 5,\n2024, and November 7, 2024. The Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on November 8, 2024.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024 and remains subject to stockholder approval.\nContingent Value Rights\nAt or prior to the Effective Time, Pieris will enter into a Contingent Value Rights Agreement, or CVR Agreement, with a rights agent, or Rights Agent, pursuant to which\nPieris’ pre-Merger capital stockholders will receive one contingent value right, or a CVR, for each outstanding share of Pieris common stock held by such stockholder, or\nshare of common stock underlying preferred stock held by such stockholder, on such date. Each CVR will represent the contractual right to receive payments upon the\nreceipt of payments by Pieris or any of its affiliates under certain strategic partner agreements, including existing collaboration agreements pursuant to which Pieris may be\nentitled to milestones and royalties in the future and other out-licensing agreements for certain of Pieris’ legacy assets, and upon the receipt of certain research and\ndevelopment tax credits in favor of Pieris or any of its affiliates, in each case as set forth in, and subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of, the CVR\nAgreement.\nThe contingent payments under the CVR Agreement, if they become payable, will become payable to the Rights Agent for subsequent distribution to the holders of the\nCVRs. In the event that no such proceeds are received, holders of the CVRs will not receive any payment pursuant to the CVR Agreement. There can be no assurance that\nholders of CVRs will receive any amounts with respect thereto. The right to the contingent payments contemplated by the CVR Agreement is a contractual right only and\nwill not be transferable, except in the limited circumstances specified in the CVR Agreement. The CVRs will not be evidenced by a certificate or any other instrument and\nwill not be registered with the SEC. The CVRs will not have any voting or dividend rights and will not represent any equity or ownership interest in Pieris or any of its\naffiliates. No interest will accrue on any amounts payable in respect of the CVRs.\nTermination Fees\nThe Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights of each of Pieris and Palvella, including, subject to compliance with the applicable terms of the Merger\nAgreement, the right of each party to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement for a superior proposal. Upon termination of the Merger\nAgreement under specified circumstances, Pieris may be required to pay Palvella a termination fee of $1.0 million and Palvella may be required to pay Pieris a termination\nfee of $2.0 million.\nSecurities Purchase Agreement\nOn July 23, 2024, and in connection with the executed Merger Agreement, Pieris entered into a securities purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with certain\ninvestors, including BVF Partners, L.P., an existing stockholder of Pieris, or the PIPE Investors, pursuant to which, among other things, the PIPE Investors have agreed to\nsubscribe for and purchase (either for cash or in exchange for the termination and cancellation of outstanding convertible notes issued by Palvella), and Pieris agreed to\nissue and sell to the PIPE Investors, an aggregate of approximately 3,154,241 of shares of Pieris common stock at a price per share equal to $13.7299 multiplied by (x)\n0.315478 divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio, or the Purchase Price, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and/or in lieu of Pieris common stock to\ncertain purchasers who so choose, pre-funded warrants, or the Pre-Funded Warrants, to purchase up to 2,592,585 shares of Pieris common stock at a purchase price per Pre-\nFunded Warrant equal to the Purchase Price minus $0.001, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, or the PIPE Financing. The Purchase Agreement\ncontains customary representations and warranties of Pieris, on the one hand, and the PIPE Investors, on the other hand, and customary conditions to closing, including the\nconsummation of the Merger. The gross proceeds from the PIPE Financing are expected to be approximately $78.9 million, before paying estimated expenses. The closing\nof the PIPE Financing is expected to occur in connection with and immediately following the consummation of the Merger.\nThe Pre-Funded Warrants do not expire, and each Pre-Funded Warrant will be exercisable at any time after the date of issuance of such Pre-Funded Warrant, subject to a\nbeneficial ownership limitation. A holder of a Pre-Funded Warrant may not exercise such Pre-Funded Warrant if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially\nown more than 4.99% or 9.99% of the number of shares of Pieris common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise, provided, however, that a\nholder may increase or decrease the beneficial ownership limitation by giving 61 days’ notice to the Company, but not to any percentage in excess of 19.99%.\nAt or prior to the closing of the PIPE Financing, Pieris will enter into a registration rights agreement, or the Registration Rights Agreement, with the PIPE Investors\npursuant to which the PIPE Investors will be entitled to certain resale registration rights with respect to shares of Pieris common stock issued to the PIPE Investors and any\nshares of Pieris common stock issued upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will be required to prepare\nand file a resale registration statement with the SEC within 30 days following the closing of the PIPE Financing. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts\nto cause this registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC within 90 days following the closing of the PIPE Financing (or within 120 days following the PIPE\nFinancing if the SEC reviews the registration statement).\n16\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe interim financial statements and this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the\nfinancial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations, both of which are contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024. In\naddition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results\nmay differ materially from those anticipated in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those set forth\nunder the caption “Risk Factors” in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 as well as those included in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024 in Part II, Item 1A.\nAs used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context indicates or otherwise requires, “our Company”, “the Company”, “Pieris”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to\nPieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nWe have registered trademarks for Pieris, Anticalin, Mabcalin and others. All other trademarks, trade names and service marks included in this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q are the property of their respective owners. Use or display by us of other parties’ trademarks, trade dress or products is not intended to and does not imply a\nrelationship with, or endorsements or sponsorship of, us by the trademark or trade dress owner.\nOverview\nWe are a biotechnology company that historically discovered and developed Anticalin® protein-based drugs to target validated disease pathways in unique and\ntransformative ways. Proprietary to us, Anticalin proteins are a novel class of therapeutics validated in the clinic and through partnerships with leading pharmaceutical\ncompanies, including Pfizer (formerly Seagen), and Boston Pharmaceuticals in immuno-oncology, or IO. Our clinical pipeline consists of IO bispecifics in partnership\nwith collaborators including SGN-BB228 (also referred to as PRS-346) targeting CD228 and 4-1BB, and BOS-342 (also referred to as PRS-342) targeting GPC3 and 4-\n1BB.\nOn March 27, 2024, we announced the implementation of a new strategy along with relevant cost-saving measures that are expected to extend its cash runway into at least\n2027, while maximizing its ability to capture the potential milestones from its partnered 4-1BB bispecific Mabcalin™ protein IO assets. We may be entitled to aggregate\nmilestones of up to approximately $15.0 million upon first patient dosed in the Phase 2 trials for SGN-BB228 and BOS-342, which are currently in Phase 1 clinical\ndevelopment, and up to approximately $40.0 million upon first patient dosed in pivotal clinical trials for SGN-BB228 and BOS-342.\nOn July 23, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Merger Sub and Palvella pursuant to which, among other matters, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of\nthe conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Palvella, with Palvella continuing as our wholly owned subsidiary and the surviving\ncorporation of the merger, or Merger. If the Merger is completed, the business of Palvella will continue as the business of the combined organization.\nWe expect to devote significant time and resources to the completion of the Merger. However, there can be no assurances that such activities will result in completion of the\nMerger. Further, the completion of the Merger may ultimately not deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance shareholder value. If the Merger is not completed, we will\nreconsider our strategic alternatives. We consider one of the following courses of actions to be the most likely alternatives if the Merger is not completed:\n• Continue to operate its business: On March 27, 2024, we announced our decision to implement measures that are expected to extend our cash runway into at least 2027,\nwhile maximizing our ability to collect potential milestones from our clinical pipeline of partnered drug candidates. If the Merger is not completed, our Board may elect to\ncontinue with this strategy and continue to operate our business.\n• Pursue another strategic transaction similar to the Merger. We may resume our process of evaluating other companies interested in pursuing a strategic transaction with\nus and, if a candidate is identified, focus our attention on negotiating and completing such a transaction with such candidate.\n• Dissolve and liquidate our assets. If for any reason the Merger does not close, our Board may conclude that it is in the best interest of stockholders to dissolve the\nCompany and liquidate our assets. In that event, we would be required to pay any contractual obligations, wind down any remaining operations, and set aside certain\nreserves for potential future claims. There would be no assurances as to the amount or timing of available cash remaining to distribute to stockholders after paying our\nobligations and setting aside funds for reserves.\nMerger Agreement\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, (i) each then-outstanding share of Palvella capital stock will be converted into the right\nto receive a number of shares of our common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio as defined in the Merger Agreement; and (ii) each then-outstanding Palvella stock option to\npurchase Palvella common stock will be assumed by us, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Merger Agreement. In connection with the Merger, and contingent on the\napproval of our stockholders, we intend to amend our amended and restated articles of incorporation to increase the number of shares of authorized common stock, change\nour corporate name to “Palvella Therapeutics, Inc.” and adopt a new 2024 equity incentive plan. The provisions for calculating the Exchange Ratio are set forth in the\nMerger Agreement, and assume a valuation for Palvella equal to $95 million, and a valuation for us equal to $21 million, provided, that (a) our net cash as of the closing is\ngreater than $11 million, then our valuation will be adjusted upwards on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the difference of: (i) our net cash, minus (ii) $11 million, and (b) if our\nnet cash is less than $11 million, then Pieris’ valuation will be adjusted downwards on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the difference of: (i) $11 million, minus (ii) our net cash.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of, and the calculation of the Exchange Ratio pursuant to, the Merger Agreement, it is currently anticipated that upon the closing of the\nMerger, our pre-Merger stockholders will own approximately 18% of the combined company and pre-Merger Palvella stockholders will own approximately 82% of the\ncombined company on a pro forma basis, based on the number of shares of our common stock expected to be issued in connection with the Merger. The shares of the\ncombined company purchased by the PIPE Investors in the PIPE Financing (as such terms are defined below) are not reflected in the foregoing percentages.\nThe provisions for calculating the Exchange Ratio are set forth in the Merger Agreement and assume a valuation for Palvella equal to $95.0 million and a valuation for our\ncompany equal to $21.0 million, subject to adjustment based on our net cash as of the date immediately preceding the anticipated closing date, as set forth in the Merger\nAgreement. The Exchange Ratio is also based on the relative capitalizations of us and Palvella, as further described in the Merger Agreement. For purposes of calculating\nthe Exchange Ratio, for each of us and Palvella, the total number of shares of capital stock of such company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger,\nexpressed on a fully-diluted and as-converted to common stock basis, calculated using the treasury stock method, will be included in the calculation of the Exchange Ratio.\nShares of our common stock underlying our stock options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with an exercise price per share of less than the volume\nweighted average closing trading price of a share of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq, for the five consecutive trading days ending five trading\ndays immediately prior to the date upon which the Merger occurs will be deemed to be outstanding, calculated using the treasury stock method, and all shares of Palvella\ncommon stock underlying outstanding Palvella stock options, warrants and other derivative securities will be deemed to be outstanding, calculated using the treasury stock\nmethod, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nIn connection with the Merger, we will seek the approval or ratification, as applicable, by our stockholders of, among other things, (a) the issuance of the shares of our\ncommon stock issuable in connection with the Merger under the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, (b) amendments to\nour amended and restated articles of incorporation to (i) increase the number of shares of authorized common stock and (ii) change the name of our company to “Palvella\nTherapeutics, Inc.” (the approvals described in clause (a) and (b), the “Required Pieris Voting Proposals”) and (c) the adoption of a new 2024 equity incentive plan, in each\ncase, as described in the Merger Agreement.\nWe and Palvella have each agreed to customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants relating to (1) using\nreasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite approvals of their respective stockholders, (2) non-solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals, (3) the conduct of their\nrespective businesses during the period between the date of signing the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, (4) using our commercially reasonable efforts to\nmaintain the existing listing of our common stock on Nasdaq and us causing the shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be approved for\nlisting on Nasdaq prior to the closing of the Merger and (5) us filing with the SEC and causing to become effective a registration statement to register the shares of our\ncommon stock to be issued in connection with the Merger, or the Registration Statement.\nConsummation of the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among other things, (1) approval by our stockholders of the Required Pieris Voting\nProposals, (2) approval by the Palvella stockholders of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (3) Nasdaq’s approval of the listing of the shares of our common stock to be\nissued in connection with the Merger, (4) the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and (5) the consummation of the PIPE Financing (as defined below), all in\naccordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement (as defined below). Each party’s obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to other specified customary\nconditions, including the representations and warranties of the other party being true and correct as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the closing date of the\nMerger, generally subject to an overall material adverse effect qualification, the performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the Merger\nAgreement required to be performed on or prior to the date of the closing of the Merger and the absence of any material adverse effect affecting the other party that is\ncontinuing on the closing date.\nThe Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights of each of us and Palvella, including, subject to compliance with the applicable terms of the Merger Agreement,\nthe right of each party to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement for a superior proposal. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under\nspecified circumstances, we may be required to pay Palvella a termination fee of $1.0 million and Palvella may be required to pay us a termination fee of $2.0 million.\nAt the Effective Time, the board of directors of the combined company is expected to consist of five members, four of whom will be designated by Palvella and one of\nwhom will be designated by us. Palvella’s designees are expected to be Wes Kaupinen, Todd Davis, George Jenkins and Tadd Wessel. Our designee is expected to be\nChristopher Kiritsy, a current member of our board of directors.\nAt or prior to the Effective Time, we will enter into a Contingent Value Rights Agreement, or the CVR Agreement, with a rights agent, pursuant to which our pre-\nMerger capital stockholders will receive one contingent value right, or a CVR, for each outstanding share of our common stock held by such stockholder, or share of\ncommon stock underlying preferred stock held by such stockholder, on such date. Each CVR will represent the contractual right to receive payments upon the receipt of\npayments by us or any of our affiliates under certain strategic partner agreements, including existing collaboration agreements pursuant to which we may be entitled to\nmilestones and royalties in the future and other out-licensing agreements for certain of our legacy assets, and upon the receipt of certain research and development tax\ncredits in favor of us or any of our affiliates, in each case as set forth in, and subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of, the CVR Agreement.\nEach CVR will represent the contractual right to receive cash payments (net of certain expenses and taxes) upon the receipt of payments by us or any of our affiliates under\ncertain strategic partner agreements, including existing collaboration agreements pursuant to which we may be entitled to milestones and royalties in the future and other\nout-licensing agreements for certain of our legacy assets, and upon the receipt of certain research and development tax credits in favor of us or any of our affiliates, in each\ncase as set forth in, and subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of, the CVR Agreement. We retain the ability under the Merger Agreement to seek to\nenter into such agreements related to our legacy assets and intellectual property, including PRS-400 and PRS-220, though we currently do not have any such agreements in\nplace and do not have any plans to divest any material assets. We continue to explore potential transactions for PRS-400 and PRS-220. Our management has determined that\nthere is no value associated with the CVRs as the likelihood of any payments received in connection with our legacy assets is remote. Unless earlier terminated by the\nrepresentative of the CVR holders and the combined company, the CVR Agreement will terminate on the date on which no strategic partner agreement is in effect and no\npayments are payable to us or any of our affiliates under any strategic partner agreement.\nThe contingent payments under the CVR Agreement, if they become payable, will become payable to the Rights Agent for subsequent distribution to the holders of the\nCVRs. In the event that no such proceeds are received, holders of the CVRs will not receive any payment pursuant to the CVR Agreement. There can be no assurance that\nholders of CVRs will receive any amounts with respect thereto. The right to the contingent payments contemplated by the CVR Agreement is a contractual right only and\nwill not be transferable, except in the limited circumstances specified in the CVR Agreement. The CVRs will not be evidenced by a certificate or any other instrument and\nwill not be registered with the SEC. The CVRs will not have any voting or dividend rights and will not represent any equity or ownership interest in us or any of our\naffiliates. No interest will accrue on any amounts payable in respect of the CVRs.\nThe proposed merger transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024 and remains subject to stockholder approval.\nConcurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with certain\ninvestors, including BVF Partners, L.P., an existing stockholder of Pieris, or the PIPE Investors, pursuant to which, among other things, the PIPE Investors have agreed to\nsubscribe for and purchase (either for cash or in exchange for the termination and cancellation of outstanding convertible notes issued by Palvella), and we agreed to issue\nand sell to the PIPE Investors, an aggregate of up to 3,154,241 of shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to $13.7299 multiplied by (x) 0.315478 divided\nby (y) the Exchange Ratio, or the Purchase Price, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and/or in lieu of our common stock to certain purchasers who\nso choose, pre-funded warrants, or the Pre-Funded Warrants, to purchase up to 2,592,585 shares of our common stock at a purchase price per Pre-Funded Warrant equal to\nthe Purchase Price minus $0.001, or the PIPE Financing. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of ours, on the one hand, and the PIPE\nInvestors, on the other hand, and customary conditions to closing, including the consummation of the Merger. The gross proceeds from the PIPE Financing are expected to\nbe approximately $78.9 million, before paying estimated expenses. The closing of the PIPE Financing is expected to occur in connection with and immediately following\nthe consummation of the Merger.\nDiscovery and Development Programs\nWe currently have several IO drug candidates partnered with major biopharmaceutical companies, which are at varying stages of development:\n• Our IO partnered portfolio includes the following drug candidates that are multi-specific Anticalin-based fusion protein drug candidates designed to engage\nimmunomodulatory targets, in partnership with Pfizer (formerly Seagen), and Boston Pharmaceutics.\n◦ In the Pfizer collaboration, SGN-BB228, a CD228 x 4-1BB bispecific antibody-Anticalin compound, was previously handed over to Pfizer, which is\nresponsible for further advancement and funding of the asset. In January 2023, the first patient was dosed in a Pfizer-sponsored Phase 1 study of SGN-BB228,\nupon which we achieved a $5.0 million milestone. Pfizer presented preclinical data for this program at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer 37th Annual\nMeeting in November 2022 and at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in April 2023. Pfizer presented the study design of\nthe Phase 1 study of SGN-BB228 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June 2023. The program is one of three programs\nin the Pfizer alliance, and we believe the previous achievement of a key development milestone for SGN-BB228 validates our approach in IO bispecifics,\ncomplementing the encouraging clinical data seen with cinrebafusp alfa. We transferred the second and third programs to Pfizer at the end of 2023, and retain a\nco-promotion option for one program in the Pfizer collaboration in the United States.\n◦ BOS-342 is a GPC3 x 4-1BB bispecific Mabcalin compound that we have exclusively licensed to Boston Pharmaceuticals. In August 2023, the first patient\nwas dosed in a Boston Pharmaceuticals sponsored Phase 1/2 study of BOS-342 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for which we received a $2.5 million\nmilestone payment and are entitled to receive up to approximately $350 million in potential development, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments, and\ntiered royalties on potential sales of BOS-342.\n17\nTable of Contents\nOur former drug candidates include:\n• Elarekibep, a former respiratory program that was partnered with AstraZeneca for the treatment of asthma, was a drug candidate that antagonizes IL-4Rα, thereby\ninhibiting the downstream action of IL-4 and IL-13, two cytokines known to be key mediators in the inflammatory cascade that drive the pathogenesis of asthma\nand other inflammatory diseases.\n◦ In June 2023, AstraZeneca communicated to us its decision to discontinue and cease dosing in the P hase 2 clinical studies of elarekibep. This decision was\nbased on lung findings from a non-clinical 13-week GLP toxicology study with dry powder inhaler-formulated elarekibep, which did not support long-term use\nand progression to later-stage development. The 13-week non-human primate study included three active dose cohorts. AstraZeneca concluded that there were\nno clinical observations across any of the doses but that there were respiratory tract pathology findings. These findings included inflammation-mediated lung\ntissue damage, which did not appear to be dose related. AstraZeneca’s decision was made independent of any data from the Phase 2a study.\n◦ In July 2023, AstraZeneca notified us of its intention to terminate the AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement and the AstraZeneca Platform License, which\nterminations became effective October 15, 2023. AstraZeneca’s decision to terminate these agreements was based on the non-clinical safety findings in a 13-\nweek toxicology study of elarekibep in non-human primates previously disclosed by us. Based upon our review, we have determined to discontinue the\nprogram for scientific reasons.\n• PRS-220, an orally inhaled Anticalin protein targeting connective tissue growth factor, or CTGF, was being developed as a local treatment for idiopathic pulmonary\nfibrosis, or IPF, and other forms of fibrotic lung diseases. CTGF, a matricellular protein, has been demonstrated to be a driver of fibrotic tissue remodeling and the\nprotein has been found over-expressed in lung tissue from patients suffering from IPF.\n◦ In 2021, we received a €14.2 million grant from the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Regional Development and Energy supporting research and\ndevelopment of the PRS-220 program. We conducted a Phase 1 study of PRS-220 in healthy volunteers in Australia, which we completed in August 2023. The\nstudy was a randomized, two-part, blinded, placebo-controlled study, designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of\nsingle and multiple ascending doses of PRS-220 when administered by oral inhalation to healthy subjects. The clinical study report was finalized at the end of\nDecember 2023. Data from the single and multiple ascending doses of PRS-220, when administered by oral inhalation to healthy subjects, demonstrated that\nPRS-220 was safe and generally well tolerated by subjects in this study at all administered doses. With the completion of the Phase 1 clinical studies, we have\ndecided to discontinue further development of the program for strategic and scientific reasons.\n• Cinrebafusp alfa is designed to drive tumor localized T cell activation through tumor-targeted drug clustering mediated by HER2 expressed on tumor cells. This\nprogram was the first 4-1BB bispecific T cell co-stimulatory agonist to enter clinical development.\n◦ In July 2022, we received fast track designation from FDA for cinrebafusp alfa. In August 2022, we announced the decision to cease further enrollment in the\ntwo-arm, multicenter, open-label Phase 2 study of cinrebafusp alfa as part of a strategic pipeline prioritization to focus our resources. Cinrebafusp alfa has\ndemonstrated clinical benefit in Phase 1 studies, including single agent activity in a monotherapy setting, and in the Phase 2 study in HER2-expressing gastric\ncancer, giving the Company confidence in its broader 4-1BB franchise. In April 2023, clinical data showing an unconfirmed 100% objective response rate and\npromising emerging durability profile were presented at the American Association of Cancer Research annual meeting. This data provided encouraging\nevidence of clinical activity for this program. We previously attempted to partner our cinrebafusp alfa program and because we were ultimately unable to find\na partner for this program, we discontinued the program and partnering efforts.\n• S095012 (also referenced as PRS-344) is a bispecific Mabcalin compound comprising a PD-L1-targeting antibody genetically linked to 4-1BB-targeting Anticalin\nproteins being developed by Servier on a worldwide basis. The first-in-human Phase 1/2 multicenter open-label dose escalation study was designed to determine\nthe safety and preliminary activity of S095012 in patients with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors. In July 2023, we notified Servier that we were opting out\nof co-development and commercialization of S095012 in the United States. On June 28, 2024, Servier notified us of its decision to terminate the Servier\nAgreements, effective December 27, 2024, and discontinue and cease dosing in the Phase 1 clinical study of S095012. This decision was based on a\npotential safety concern in the S095012 Phase 1 clinical studies. We do not intend to pursue any further development of S095012.\n• In May 2021, we also entered into a multi-program research collaboration and license agreement with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, to discover,\ndevelop and commercialize locally delivered respiratory and ophthalmology therapies. In April and May 2023, the ophthalmology and respiratory programs were\njointly discontinued, respectively. Genentech also had options to select two additional programs with the payment of a fee, which expired in May 2024. With the\nexpiration of these options and no programs active or ongoing, the Genentech Agreement also expired.\nSince inception, we have devoted nearly all of our efforts and resources to our research and development activities and have incurred significant net losses. For the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported net loss of $2.9 million and $11.4 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we\nreported net loss of $10.8 million and $20.0 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $326.3 million. We expect to continue\nincurring substantial losses as we devote time and resources into exploring strategic transactions. Our operating expenses have historically been comprised of research and\ndevelopment expenses and general and administrative expenses.\n18\nTable of Contents\nWe have not generated any revenues from product sales to date and we do not expect to generate revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our revenues for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023 were from license and collaboration agreements with our partners.\nA significant portion of our operations are conducted in countries other than the United States. Since we conduct our business in U.S. dollars, our main exposure, if any,\nresults from changes in the exchange rates between the euro and the U.S. dollar. At each period end, we remeasure assets and liabilities to the functional currency of that\nentity (for example, U.S. dollar payables recorded by our subsidiary, Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH). Remeasurement gains and losses are recorded in the statement of\noperations line item “Other income (expense), net”. All assets and liabilities denominated in euros are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet\ndate. Revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. All adjustments\nresulting from translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nKey Financial Terms and Metrics\nThe following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues\nWe have not generated any revenues from product sales to date and we do not expect to generate revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future. Our revenues for\nthe last two years have been from the license and collaboration agreements with AstraZeneca, Servier, Pfizer, Genentech and Boston Pharmaceuticals.\nThe revenues from AstraZeneca, Servier, Pfizer, Genentech and Boston Pharmaceuticals have been comprised primarily of upfront payments, research and development\nservices and milestone payments. For additional information about our revenue recognition policy, see “Note 2— Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe process of researching and developing drugs for human use is lengthy, unpredictable and subject to many risks. Historically, we have incurred substantial expenses as\nwe continued to develop our clinical and preclinical drug candidates and programs. Also included in research and development costs in 2023 were severance costs\nassociated with the workforce reduction announced in July 2023. In the third quarter of 2023, we had stopped or taken actions to wind down research and development costs\nrelated to all proprietary programs.\nOn March 27, 2024, we announced that we would be discontinuing all of our research and development activities. We have no further spending obligations related to our\npartnered IO programs. We expect research and development costs to be significantly lower than historical amounts.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, equity compensation and other personnel-related costs associated with executive,\nadministrative and other support staff. Other significant general and administrative expenses include the costs associated with professional fees for accounting, auditing,\ninsurance costs, consulting and legal services along with facility and maintenance costs attributable to general and administrative functions. Included in general and\nadministrative costs are costs associated with evaluating strategic alternatives and severance costs associated with the workforce reductions announced in July 2023 and\nMarch 2024. We expect general and administrative costs to be significantly lower than historical amounts given the leaner organization and elimination of research and\ndevelopment spending going forward.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table sets forth our revenues and operating expenses (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September\n30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues $ — $ 19,520 $ 53 $ 41,511\nResearch and development expenses (446) 9,595 1,523 37,347\nGeneral and administrative expenses 3,581 6,839 11,145 14,526\nAsset impairment — 14,893 — 14,893\nTotal operating expenses 3,135 31,327 12,668 66,766\nOther income\nInterest income 169 549 610 1,396\nGrant income — — — 3,612\nOther income 79 506 636 288\nNet loss $ (2,887) $ (10,752) $ (11,369) $ (19,959)\n19\nTable of Contents\nRevenues\nThe following table provides a comparison of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease)\nCustomer revenue $ — $ 15,569 $ (15,569)\nCollaboration revenue — 3,951 (3,951)\nTotal Revenue $ — $ 19,520 (19,520)\n• The $15.6 million decrease in customer revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is entirely\ndue to no revenue being recognized in the current period as all obligations related to customer revenue have previously been satisfied.\n• The $4.0 million decrease in collaboration revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is due\nto no revenue pass through cost or collaboration reimbursement being recognized in the current period as all obligations related to the collaboration agreement have\npreviously been satisfied.\nThe following table provides a comparison of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease)\nCustomer revenue $ 6 $ 37,665 $ (37,659)\nCollaboration revenue 47 3,846 (3,799)\nTotal Revenue $ 53 $ 41,511 (41,458)\n• The $37.7 million decrease in customer revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects\nonly the final, minimal amounts of reimbursement revenue being recognized in the current period as all obligations related to customer revenue have previously\nbeen satisfied.\n• The $3.8 million decrease in collaboration revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflects\nfinal minimal amounts of reimbursement revenue recorded in the current period, as compared to the reimbursement revenue related to the now-terminated S095012\nproduct under the Servier collaboration agreement recorded in the prior period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe following table provides a comparison of the research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease)\nRespiratory $ (36) $ 442 $ (478)\nImmuno-oncology (501) 1,125 (1,626)\nOther R&D activities 91 8,028 (7,937)\nTotal $ (446) $ 9,595 (10,041)\n• The $0.5 million decrease in our respiratory programs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is\ndue primarily to the completion of winddown activities related to PRS-220 and PRS-400, in connection with the Company's strategic update that was announced\nand initiated in July 2023. The credit balance for respiratory program expense in the current period is primarily due to a favorable final settlement on the amount\nowed to a single vendor compared to original estimates.\n• The $1.6 million decrease in our immuno-oncology programs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30,\n2023 is due primarily to decreases in manufacturing and clinical costs for both cinrebafusp alfa and S095012, as such programs have been discontinued or were\nhanded over to partners. The credit balance for IO expense in the current period is primarily due to a favorable final settlement on the amount owed to a single\nvendor compared to the original estimates.\n• The $7.9 million decrease in other research and development activities expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months\nended September 30, 2023 is driven by lower overall personnel costs due to lower headcount as a result of restructuring actions announced in July 2023 and March\n2024, no depreciation in 2024 as a result of the Company's asset sale, and lower overall lab supply costs due to the lab facility wind down.\n20\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a comparison of the research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Increase/(Decrease)\nRespiratory $ (118) $ 11,330 $ (11,448)\nImmuno-oncology 29 5,710 (5,681)\nOther R&D activities 1,612 20,307 (18,695)\nTotal $ 1,523 $ 37,347 (35,824)\n• The $11.4 million decrease in our respiratory programs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nis due primarily to the completion of winddown activities related to PRS-220 and PRS-400 in connection with our strategic update that was announced and\ninitiated in July 2023. The credit balance for respiratory program expense in the current period is primarily due to a favorable final settlement on the amount owed\nto a single vendor compared to the original estimates.\n• The $5.7 million decrease in our immuno-oncology programs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 is due primarily to decreases in manufacturing and clinical costs for both cinrebafusp alfa and S095012, as such programs have been discontinued or handed\nover to partners. Offsetting IO expense in the first half of 2024, we benefitted from a favorable final settlement in the third quarter of 2024 on the amount owed to a\nsingle vendor compared to the original estimates.\n• The $18.7 million decrease in other research and development activities expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 is driven by lower overall personnel costs due to lower headcount as a result of restructuring actions announced in July 2023 and March\n2024, no depreciation in 2024 as a result of our asset sale, and lower overall lab supply costs due to the lab facility wind down.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe period-over-period decrease was driven by lower overall personnel costs due to lower headcount as a result of restructuring actions announced in July 2023 and March\n2024, no depreciation in 2024 as a result of the Company's asset sale process, lower professional services spending given the winddown of programs and activities, and\nlower rent and facility costs. These benefits were partially offset by higher legal spending related to ongoing strategic alternative evaluation and the impact of lower\nallocated facility and information technology, or IT, costs to research and development departments given the winddown of research and development programs and\nactivities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe period-over-period decrease was driven by lower overall personnel costs due to lower headcount as a result of restructuring actions announced in July 2023 and March\n2024 and no depreciation in 2024 as a result of the Company's asset sale process and lower professional services spending given the winddown of programs and activities.\nThese benefits were partially offset by higher legal spending related to ongoing strategic alternative evaluation and the impact of lower allocated facility and IT costs to\nresearch and development departments given the winddown of research and development programs and activities.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOur other income was $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Period-over-period\nthere was a decrease in interest income in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and unrealized losses in the current period due to an overall strengthening U.S. dollar.\nThis was partially offset by a net gain on the sales of all property and equipment compared to the estimated fair value of the assets held for sale.\nOur other income was $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The period-over-period\ndecrease was primarily due to lower grant income and lower interest income, offset slightly by unrealized gains in the current period due to an overall strengthening U.S.\ndollar and a net gain on the sales of all property and equipment compared to the estimated fair value of the assets held for sale.\n21\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn March 27, 2024, the Company announced the implementation of a new strategy along with relevant cost-saving measures that are expected to extend its cash runway\ninto at least 2027, while maximizing its ability to capture the potential milestones from its partnered 4-1BB bispecific Mabcalin protein IO assets. The Company may be\nentitled to aggregate milestones of up to approximately $15.0 million upon first patient dosed in the Phase 2 trials for SGN-BB228 and BOS-342, which are currently in\nPhase 1 clinical development, and up to approximately $40.0 million upon first patient dosed in pivotal clinical trials for SGN-BB228 and BOS-342.\nThrough September 30, 2024, we have funded our operations primarily through private and public sales of equity, payments received under our license and collaboration\nagreements (including research and development services costs, and upfront and milestone payments), government grants and loans.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had a total of $19.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. We have incurred losses in every period since inception, with the\nexception of the three months ended June 30, 2023, and have a total accumulated deficit of $326.3 million as of September 30, 2024. Net losses and negative cash flows\nhave had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders’ equity and working capital. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next\nseveral years.\nWe have historically devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development and general and administrative expenses to support such\nresearch and development.\nWe expect cash necessary to fund operations will continue to decrease significantly in the near term as we have taken measures to preserve cash, including implementing\nsignificant workforce reductions and terminating all research and development activities.\nThe following table provides a summary of operating, investing and financing cash flows (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (8,330) $ (34,150)\nNet cash provided by investing activities 11,318 8,553\nNet cash provided by financing activities — 19,781\nNet cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $8.3 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $34.2 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in operations in the current period is predominantly attributable to the $38.9 million impact of a\nreduction in deferred revenue and an offsetting $4.8 million decrease in accounts receivable in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the current period\nin which, given the winddown of operating programs and suspension of research and development activities, there was no cash used in operations related to deferred\nrevenue and only a $0.2 million decrease in accounts receivable.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $11.3 million, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of\n$8.6 million for the same period in 2023. The change in net cash used is predominantly attributable to the impact of net investments changes and the timing of maturities in\nthe current period as well as proceeds on the sale of all assets, as compared to the prior period.\nThere was no net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of\n$19.8 million for the same period in 2023. The change in net cash used is predominantly attributable to the $19.7 million impact of the issuance of stock resulting from the\nATM Program (as defined in Note 9) sales activity performed during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nEffective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on April 22, 2024, we effected a 1-for-80 reverse stock split of our common stock. All references to shares of common stock\noutstanding, average number of shares outstanding and per share amounts in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been restated to reflect the reverse stock split on a\nretroactive basis.\nIn August 2021, we established the ATM Program under a sales agreement with Jefferies LLC, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock, from\ntime to time, up to an aggregate amount of gross sales proceeds of $50.0 million. In November 2022, the sales agreement was amended to provide for an increase in the\naggregate offering amount, such that under the ATM Program, as amended, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, up to an aggregate\namount of gross sales proceeds of $75.0 million. The ATM Program, as amended, is offered under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was filed with and\ndeclared effective by the SEC in August 2021. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any shares under the ATM Program.\nOn July 23, 2024, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with the PIPE Investors, including BVF Partners, L.P., an existing stockholder of Pieris, pursuant to which,\namong other things, the PIPE Investors have agreed to subscribe for and purchase (either for cash or in exchange for the termination and cancellation of outstanding\nconvertible notes issued by Palvella), and we agreed to issue and sell to the PIPE Investors, an aggregate of approximately 3,154,241 of shares of our common stock at a\nprice per share equal to the Purchase Price, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and/or in lieu of our common stock to certain purchasers who so\nchoose, the Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase up to 2,592,585 shares of our common stock at a purchase price per Pre-Funded Warrant equal to the Purchase Price minus\n$0.001, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of us, on the one hand,\nand the PIPE Investors, on the other hand, and customary conditions to closing, including the consummation of the Merger. The gross proceeds from the PIPE Financing are\nexpected to be approximately $78.9 million, before paying estimated expenses. The closing of the PIPE Financing is expected to occur in connection with and immediately\nfollowing the consummation of the Merger.\nThe Pre-Funded Warrants do not expire, and each Pre-Funded Warrant will be exercisable at any time after the date of issuance of such Pre-Funded Warrant, subject to a\nbeneficial ownership limitation. A holder of a Pre-Funded Warrant may not exercise such Pre-Funded Warrant if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially\nown more than 4.99% or 9.99% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise, provided, however, that a holder\nmay increase or decrease the beneficial ownership limitation by giving 61 days’ notice to us, but not to any percentage in excess of 19.99%.\nAt or prior to the closing of the PIPE Financing, we will enter into the Registration Rights Agreement with the PIPE Investors pursuant to which the PIPE Investors will be\nentitled to certain resale registration rights with respect to shares of our common stock issued to the PIPE Investors and any shares of our common stock issued upon\nexercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we will be required to prepare and file a resale registration statement with the SEC\nwithin 30 days following the closing of the PIPE Financing. We shall use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause this registration statement to be declared effective by\nthe SEC within 90 days following the closing of the PIPE Financing (or within 120 days following the PIPE Financing if the SEC reviews the registration statement).\nWe are currently subject to the SEC general instructions of Form S-3 known as the “baby shelf rules.” Under these instructions, the amount of funds we can raise through\nprimary public offerings of securities in any 12-month period using our registration statement on Form S-3 is limited to one-third of the aggregate market value of the shares\nof our common stock held by non-affiliates. Therefore, we will be limited in the amount of proceeds we are able to raise by selling shares of our common stock using our\nForm S-3, including under the ATM Program, until such time as our public float exceeds $75 million.\nWe have historically devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development and general and administrative expenses to support such\nresearch and development. We expect cash necessary to fund operations will continue to decrease significantly as we have decided to discontinue all research and\ndevelopment activities and implement a further workforce reduction, as disclosed in our March 27, 2024 strategic update.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that our currently available funds will be sufficient to fund our remaining limited operations through at least the next 12 months from the issuance of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOur belief with respect to our ability to fund operations is based on estimates that are subject to these and other risks and uncertainties.\nIf we seek to raise additional capital to fulfill our operating and capital requirements through public or private equity financings, utilization of our current ATM Program,\nstrategic collaborations, licensing arrangements, government grants and/or the achievement of milestones under our collaborative agreements, there is no assurance that\nwe will be successful in obtaining sufficient funding on terms acceptable to us to fund continuing operations, if at all, and the terms of any future financing may adversely\naffect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nRefer to Part II, Item 7, “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of\nour critical accounting policies and estimates.\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S.\nGAAP. We believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because these\nspecific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate, and different estimates—which also\nwould have been reasonable—could have been used. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We\nbase our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of\nwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from\nthese estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that our most critical accounting policies are those relating to revenue recognition, contingencies, research and development expense and income taxes, and\nthere have not been significant changes to our accounting policies discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2023.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact, if any, that the adoption of each standard will have. For the recently issued accounting\nstandards that we believe may have an impact on our consolidated financial statements, see “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements.\nSmaller Reporting Company Status\nCurrently, we qualify as a smaller reporting company.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are eligible for and have taken advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are not available to public\nreporting companies that do not qualify for this classification, including, but not limited to:\n• An opportunity for reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic and annual reports, including exemption from the\nrequirements to provide a compensation discussion and analysis describing compensation practices and procedures,\n• An opportunity for reduced financial statement disclosure in registration statements and in annual reports on Form 10-K, which only requires two years of audited\nfinancial statements rather than the three years of audited financial statements that are required for other public companies,\n• An opportunity for reduced audit and other compliance expenses as we are not subject to the requirement to obtain an auditor’s report on internal control over\nfinancial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and\n• An opportunity to utilize the non-accelerated filer time-line requirements.\nFor as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we expect that we will take advantage of both the reduced internal control audit requirements and the\ndisclosure obligations available to us as a result of this classification.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.\n23\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the\nreports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and\nsuch information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, based\non such evaluation, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control required by Rules 13a-15(d)\nand 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,\nour internal control over financial reporting.\n24\nTable of Contents\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nAs of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we are not party to and our property is not subject to any material pending legal proceedings. However, from time to\ntime, we may become involved in legal proceedings or subject to claims seeking monetary damages or other relief. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings or\nclaims could have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nItem 1A.
