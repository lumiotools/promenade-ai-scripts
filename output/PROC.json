(NASDAQ: PROC) (‚ÄúProcaps‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), announced today that, on November 13, 2024, the Company received formal notice from the Listing Qualifications Department (the ‚ÄúStaff‚Äù) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (‚ÄúNasdaq‚Äù) that, based upon the Company‚Äôs failure to timely file the Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the ‚ÄúForm 20-F‚Äù) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‚ÄúSEC‚Äù), the Company no longer satisfied Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the ‚ÄúFiling Rule‚Äù) and its securities are therefore subject to suspension and delisting unless the Company timely requests a hearing before and a further stay of any suspension action at least pending the ultimate conclusion of the hearings process from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the ‚ÄúPanel‚Äù).\n\nThe Company plans to timely request a hearing before the Panel as well as a further stay. The Panel will review the request of an extended stay and notify the Company of its determination as soon as practicable, but in any event no later than 15 calendar days following the deadline to request the hearing. Nasdaq notified the Company that hearings are typically scheduled to occur approximately 30-45 days after the date of the hearing request. Until the Panel makes a determination regarding the stay request, the Company‚Äôs securities will continue to trade on Nasdaq.\n\nThe Company continues to work diligently to complete the previously disclosed independent investigation and to file the Form 20-F with the SEC as soon as practicable.\n\n**About Procaps Group**\n\nProcaps Group, S.A. (‚ÄúProcaps‚Äù) (NASDAQ: PROC) is a leading developer of pharmaceutical and nutraceutical solutions, medicines, and hospital supplies that reach more than 50 countries in all five continents.

(NASDAQ: PROC) (‚ÄúProcaps‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a leading integrated international healthcare and pharmaceutical services company, today announced its financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (‚Äú3Q23‚Äù) and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (\"9M23‚Äù). \n\n**_Financial Highlights 3Q23 & 9M23_**\n\n  * Net revenues totaled $118 million for 3Q23, positively impacted by the performance of RX and OTC portfolios, offset by lower CDMO revenues. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by 2% in 3Q23. For 9M23, net revenues totaled $313 million, an increase of 5% on a constant currency basis. \n  * Gross profit for 3Q23 totaled $68 million with a 58% gross margin and totaled $176 million for 9M23 with a 56% gross margin, mainly impacted by higher costs and mix of products sold. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $22 million in 3Q23, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 19%. For 9M23, Adjusted EBITDA was $51 million. \n\n\n\n_U$ million_ |  **3Q23** |  **3Q22** |  **Œî%** |  **9M23** |  **9M22** |  **Œî%**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Net Revenues** |  118  |  110  |  **7%** |  313  |  308  |  **1.4%**  \nFX Impact on Net Revenues  |  6  |  -  |  (12)  |  -   \n**Constant Currency Net Revenues** |  112.9  |  110  |  **2%** |  325  |  308  |  **5%**  \n**Gross profit** |  **68** |  **68** |  **1%** |  **176** |  **187** |  **-6%**  \n_Gross margin_ |  58%  |  61%  |  -343 bps  |  56%  |  61%  |  -454 bps   \n**Adjusted EBITDA** |  **22** |  **23** |  **-4%** |  **51** |  **60** |  **-14%**  \nFX Impact on Adjusted EBITDA  |  1  |  -  |  (2)  |  -   \n**Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA** |  **21** |  **23** |  **-9%** |  **53** |  **60** |  **-11%**  \n_Adj.

We are encouraged by our strong operational execution and refinement of our strategic plan to ensure a stronger, more resilient organization that thrives beyond short-term hurdles. \n\n‚ÄúMultiple macroeconomic factors continued to challenge the industry in our region, impacting our revenues. We continue to adapt our strategies to navigate this dynamic landscape and protect our profitability and are seeing positive trends materializing in 4Q23 which we expect will lead to improved results over 4Q22. \n\n‚ÄúDuring the quarter we announced an agreement with BDR Pharmaceuticals for 27 oncology molecules for Latin America, including 20 TKIs (Tirosyne Kinase Inhibitors). Under the agreement, Procaps is responsible for registration, branding, marketing and commercialization throughout Latin America. We are very excited to expand our oncology portfolio in the region and add more partner companies and potentially broaden cancer treatment options with several new molecules to better serve more patients and physicians. \n\n‚ÄúTo support increased U.S. demand of our advanced gummy technologies for the global nutraceutical industry capacity expansion in the U.S. continue as planned with the ongoing construction of a new gummy manufacturing facility in Florida. We expect operations to commence in 1Q24 with revenues following later in the quarter. Also in the U.S. we are exploring new products, especially high potency compounds, to take advantage of the West Palm Beach facility which has production capacity of approximately 1.8 billion softgel capsules per year for our iCDMO business unit. \n\n‚ÄúDuring the quarter we participated as one of the five sustainable sponsors at CPHI Barcelona 2023 and welcomed over 300 business partners, current and new, at our booth. We were very pleased with the level of interest across the global pharma community of attendees. \n\n‚ÄúAs we continue to focus on growth, and after months of considering how to best serve the Company, earlier this year I announced that leading the Company on important strategic initiatives rather than on day-to-day matters would be of better value to the Company. We have in place the necessary capabilities to position the Company for long-term success and as announced, I will transition to Executive Chairman of the Company on January 15, with the announcement of Jose Antonio Vieira as the new CEO,‚Äù concluded Minski. \n\n**_Guidance Update_**\n\nGiven the slowdown in growth in some markets, especially during the month of September and October and the current macroeconomic environment, we are revising our guidance for the full year. \n\nThe impact of the macroeconomic conditions that the industry has experienced through the year, followed the same pattern in the third and fourth quarter - order phasing from CDMO partners, OTC taking longer to recover, launches delays due to delay in registration approvals, and sales of brands that were postponed. \n\nThe Company now expects full year 2023 net revenues growth of approximately 6% on a constant currency basis, and an adjusted EBITDA in the range of $77M - $82M. \n\nThis short-term scenario does not change our medium and long-term expectations for the Latin American market. We believe this market slowdown is only temporary and in the next years the market will continue to benefit from the aging of the population, greater market access and increase in health coverage. \n\nPlease check Procaps investor relations website for full Earning Release details, at: [https://investor.procapsgroup.com/financials/quarterly-reports](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.procapsgroup.com%2Ffinancials%2Fquarterly-reports&esheet=53874533&newsitemid=20231226910930&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.procapsgroup.com%2Ffinancials%2Fquarterly-reports&index=1&md5=45b2fa6c74dd89a391a6e073cfdcc250)\n\nConference Call Information: \n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast in late January 2024, after the arrival of the new CEO.

Such forward-looking statements with respect to revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, synergies, prospects, and other aspects of the businesses of Procaps are based on current expectations that are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: (1) the inability to successfully retain or recruits officers, key employees, or directors; (2) effects on Procaps' public securities' liquidity and trading; (3) the lack of a market for Procaps' securities; (4) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (5) the possibility that Procaps may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (6) the Company‚Äôs inability to achieve its cost saving goals and value creating initiatives, (7) our ability to remediate our disclosed material weaknesses within certain time frames, if at all and (8) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in documents filed or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") by Procaps. Accordingly, forward-looking statements, including any projections or analysis, should not be viewed as factual and should not be relied upon as an accurate prediction of future results. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on Procaps.
