These findings underscore PRF-110’s potential to provide effective pain relief during the critical early postoperative period.\n\nHowever, data pertaining to the subsequent 24-hour period, which is essential for assessing the primary endpoint of the trial, is currently unclear due to incoherence of the data. PainReform is actively collaborating with Lotus to resolve this to complete the analysis of this portion of the data. At present, there can be no assurance that the effort to resolve the incoherence will be successful.\n\n“We are cautiously encouraged by the statistically significant pain reduction observed in the initial 48 hours, highlighting PRF-110’s promise as an effective solution for post-surgical pain,” said Ehud Geller, Chairman and interim CEO of PainReform. “While we are addressing the data issues concerning the subsequent 24-hour period., we plan on providing updates as our analysis progresses and we gain a clearer understanding of PRF-110’s efficacy across the full study follow-up period.”\n\nPRF-110 is PainReform’s proprietary, oil-based, extended-release formulation of ropivacaine, a widely used local anesthetic. Designed to provide prolonged pain relief while reducing the need for opioids, PRF-110 has the potential to significantly enhance patient recovery and safety in the post-surgical setting.\n\n**About Phase 3 Clinical Trial**\n\nThe bunionectomy Phase 3 trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of intra-operative administration of PRF-110 following unilateral bunionectomy. The study is conducted in two parts. In the first part, a total of 15 patients were enrolled in an open label study at a single site in which PRF-110 was administered intra-operatively to measure safety and plasma concentration levels. All safety requirements including plasma concentration levels were met, and the study proceeded to the second part. In the second part, we randomized 428 patients. PRF-110 was administered intra-operatively and patients were divided into three cohorts, PRF-110, Naropin® (ropivacaine), and placebo in a 2:2:1 ratio. The primary efficacy endpoint is mean area under the curve, or AUC, of the numerical rating scale, or NRS, of pain intensity scores over 72 hours (AUC0-72) for PRF110 compared with placebo. Secondary efficacy endpoints include mean AUC0-72 of the NRS of pain intensity scores for PRF110 compared with plain ropivacaine, total post-surgery opioid consumption (in morphine equivalents) over 72 hours for PRF110 compared with saline placebo, the proportion of subjects who are opioid-free through 72 hours for PRF110 compared to that of plain ropivacaine, the total postoperative opioid consumption through 72 hours for PRF110 compared to that of plain ropivacaine. Safety endpoints include incidence of treatment emergent adverse events and serious adverse events, physical examination, vital signs and wound healing. If the first Phase 3 clinical trial of patients undergoing bunionectomy is successful, we plan to initiate a second trial for pain treatment of hernia repair operations.\n\n**About PainReform**\n\nPainReform is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the reformulation of established therapeutics. PRF-110, the Company’s lead product is based on the local anesthetic ropivacaine, targeting the postoperative pain relief market. PRF-110 is an oil-based, viscous, clear solution that is deposited directly into the surgical wound bed prior to closure to provide localized and extended postoperative analgesia. The Company’s proprietary extended-release drug-delivery system is designed to provide an extended period of post-surgical pain relief without the need for repeated dose administration while reducing the potential need for the use of opiates.

Confirms Sutures Compatibilityin Human Clinical Trials for PRF-110\n\n_Positive Compatibility Results Reinforce Safety and Efficacyof PRF-110 in Post-Surgical Pain Management_\n\n**Tel Aviv, Israel – September 11, 2024 –**[PainReform Ltd.](http://www.painreform.com/) (Nasdaq: PRFX) (“**PainReform** ” or the “**Company** “), a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the reformulation of established therapeutics, today announced positive findings regarding the compatibility of sutures in human clinical trials of its lead product, PRF-110. PRF-110 is designed to provide extended, non-opiate, post-surgical pain relief.\n\nThe Company conducted comprehensive in vitro studies to assess the impact of PRF-110 on both non-absorbable and resorbable sutures. Given that suture materials are often in proximity to the PRF-110 oily solution following surgery, it was critical to evaluate whether PRF-110 would affect the mechanical properties of these sutures. The mechanical integrity, including breaking force and elongation, of PROLENE™ non-absorbable sutures and Vicryl™ resorbable sutures was tested at the outset (time zero) and after 14 days, with comparisons made to a control group.\n\nThe results indicated that PRF-110 does not impact the mechanical properties of either PROLENE™ or Vicryl™ sutures. This clearly suggests that the use of PRF-110 in wound closure procedures adjacent to surgical sutures is compatible with suture performance under surgical conditions. These findings are consistent with the phase III clinical results from the bunionectomy trial.\n\nEhud Geller, Chairman and interim CEO of PainReform, commented, “We are pleased to report that PRF-110 has demonstrated compatibility with common surgical sutures in our clinical trials. This important milestone underscores the safety and efficacy of PRF-110 as we continue to advance our lead product toward commercialization. The ability to deliver extended pain relief without compromising suture integrity represents a significant advancement in post-surgical care.”\n\n**About PainReform**\n\nPainReform is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the reformulation of established therapeutics.
