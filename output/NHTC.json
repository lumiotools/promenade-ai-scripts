However, we still managed to achieve sequential growth in net sales, as well as a year-over-year improvement in the third quarter. While the pace of growth is not where we’d like it to be, our customers and leaders continue to demonstrate strong engagement, and we are working closely with them to navigate these changing times with trainings, product roadshows and new products to help drive growth and expand their customer base,\" commented Chris Sharng, President of Natural Health Trends Corp.\n\nMr. Sharng continued, “Our ability to adapt, adjust programs, and fine-tune our plans has been instrumental in supporting our customer base while also acting in the best interests of our shareholders. We are maintaining attentive focus on cost control, including expense management, inventory, and product optimization, to ensure the company remains positioned for future success.”\n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow**\n\n  * Net cash used in operating activities was $3.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $4.2 million in the first nine months of 2023. Before tax installment payments, the liability of which arises from the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), cash provided by operating activities was $514,000 in the first nine months 2024, versus cash used in operating activities of $1.2 million in the comparable period a year ago. Of the total Tax Act liability of $20.2 million, $15.1 million has been paid to date.\n  * Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $46.3 million at September 30, 2024, down from $48.7 million at June 30, 2024.\n  * On October 28, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 on each share of common stock outstanding.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Item 1.\nBusiness,” include “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). When used\nin this report, the words or phrases “will likely result,” “expect,” “intend,” “will continue,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “believe” and similar expressions are\nintended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Exchange Act. These statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning, among other\nthings, future revenue, earnings, growth strategies, new products and initiatives, future operations and operating results, and future business and market opportunities.\nForward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the date hereof, and forward-looking statements in documents incorporated by reference speak only as of\nthe date of those documents. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events\nor otherwise, except as required by law. We caution and advise readers that these statements are based on certain assumptions that may not be realized and involve risks and\nuncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and beliefs contained herein.\nFor a summary of certain risks related to our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom our forward-looking statements are set forth in this report, including under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and in our financial statements and the related notes.\nUnless otherwise noted, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” and “Company,” refer to Natural Health Trends Corp. and its subsidiaries. References to “dollars” and “$” are to\nUnited States dollars.\nTable of Contents\nPart I\nItem 1. BUSINESS\nOverview of Business\nNatural Health Trends Corp. is an international direct-selling and e-commerce company. Subsidiaries controlled by us sell personal care, wellness, and “quality of\nlife” products under the “NHT Global” brand. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries have an active physical presence in the following markets: the Americas, which consists of\nthe United States, Canada, Cayman Islands, Mexico and Peru; Greater China, which consists of Hong Kong, Taiwan and China; Southeast Asia, which consists of Malaysia,\nSingapore and Thailand; South Korea; Japan; India; and Europe. We also operate in Russia and Kazakhstan through our engagement with a local service provider.\nMost of our order volume, particularly in our Hong Kong subsidiary, is for personal consumption through existing members’ referrals. Our objectives are to enrich the\nlives of our customers and enable our members to benefit financially from the sale of our products.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware and maintain our corporate headquarters in Hong Kong.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “NHTC.”\nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at www.naturalhealthtrendscorp.com. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\namendments to such reports are available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file electronically such material with, or furnish it to, the\nUnited States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. The information provided on our website should not be considered part of this report. The SEC maintains an\ninternet website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.\nOur Principal Products\nWe offer a line of “NHT Global” branded products in six distinct categories: wellness, herbal, beauty, lifestyle, home, and daily. These product categories, along with\nthe business opportunity we offer in most of our markets, provide our members a platform to further their goal of achieving and maintaining healthy, quality lifestyles\ncomplete with product supplementation and the opportunity for financial rewards.\nThe following table summarizes our product offering by category:\nProduct Category Description Products\nWellness\nProducts formulated and designed to meet specific Liquid, encapsulated, tableted and powder dietary and Premium Noni Juice, Triotein™, Cluster X2™,\nwellness goals of our customers.

Our product development is an ongoing process\nthat is fueled by marketplace trends, new technologies and scientific findings, members’ input, research and vendor proposals.\n2\nTable of Contents\nWorking closely with raw material manufacturers and contract manufacturers, our mission is to co-develop and bring to market the highest quality products. Our\nmanufacturers are primarily located in the United States, as well as a few in South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Europe and China. Our raw materials are sourced from\nreputable suppliers around the world. All current and new products introduced into the market are tested to ensure country and state regulatory compliance requirements are\nmet where the products are sold. This includes proper handling, shipping, and shelf-life recommendations for our products. In addition, raw material Certificates of\nAnalyses are reviewed to ensure that appropriate testing has been performed and are within required ingredient specifications.\nOperations of the Business\nOperating Strategy\nOur objective is to help our members succeed in achieving their life objectives; be it personal health, beauty, happiness or financial rewards. Our employees focus on\nassisting our members in attaining their goals.\nWe believe we have a competitive business model applicable to the markets in which we conduct business based on six key competencies:\n• Our field leaders are experienced and culturally coherent. They work effectively with our management, implementing our strategies and providing continuous\nfeedback to improve our services.\n• A discipline and capability has been established to continue launching high-quality consumer products that are designed to facilitate the accomplishment of our\ncorporate objectives.\n• We have developed and rolled out a comprehensive training system that provides a complete advancement path appropriate for our members. Our training material\ncovers the needs of our members, be they prospects, new recruits, product evangelists, sales leaders or dream builders.\n• We have developed a year-round, multi-faceted promotional plan that targets different segments of our membership.\n• We have implemented a commission structure that makes it as easy as possible to join our business, while giving existing members a chance to start earning money\nas quickly as possible in multiple ways.\n• The continuously improving mentality and methodology in our customer services have not only distinguished us as an organization, but have also given us a\nconstant flow of information as to how we can do better to service our members.\nSourcing of Products\nOur staff works with research and development personnel of our manufacturers and other prospective vendors to create product concepts and develop the product\nideas into actual products. We then may enter into supply agreements with the vendors pursuant to which we obtain rights to sell the products under private labels (or\ntrademarks) that are owned by us. In addition, some of our local markets introduce their own products from time to time and these products are sometimes adopted by our\nother markets.\nWe generally purchase finished goods from third-party manufacturers and sell them to our members for retail and personal consumption. We believe that in the event\nwe are unable to timely source products from our current or alternate suppliers, our revenue, income and cash flow could be adversely and materially impacted. See “Item\n1A. Risk Factors - We rely on a limited number of independent third parties to manufacture and supply our products on a timely basis.” We have some contracts with our\nsuppliers with automatic renewal rights.\n3\nTable of Contents\nMarketing and Distribution\nWe distribute our products internationally primarily through a network marketing system, which is a form of person-to-person direct selling. Under this system,\nmembers primarily refer our products to prospective consumers or they may buy at wholesale or discounted prices for personal consumption or for resale to consumers. The\nconcept of network marketing is based on the strength of personal recommendations that frequently come from friends, neighbors, relatives, and close acquaintances. We\nbelieve that network marketing is an effective way to distribute our products because it allows person-to-person product education and testimonials as well as higher levels\nof customer service, all of which are not as readily available through other distribution channels. In this document, we generically use the term “member” to refer to\nmembers who purchase for their own consumption or for resale, or both, as well as to members who only sign up to consume our products.\nEach of our products is designated a specified number of bonus volume points. Commissions are paid to members based on total personal and group bonus volume\npoints per weekly sales period. Bonus volume points are essentially a percentage of a product’s wholesale price.\nVirtually all of our members are independent full-time or part-time contractors who purchase products directly from our subsidiaries via the internet for their own\npersonal consumption or for resale to retail consumers. Purchasers of our products in some of our smaller markets and purchasers of our products from our China subsidiary\nmay purchase only for their own personal consumption and not for resale.\nThe following table sets forth the number of active members by market as of the dates indicated. We consider a member “active” if they have placed at least one\nproduct order with us during the preceding year. Members may not necessarily reside in the market for which they sign up as a member.\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nAmericas1 4,040 4,410\nHong Kong (including those members residing in China)2 23,490 28,550\nTaiwan 2,230 2,390\nSouth Korea 80 70\nJapan 520 640\nMalaysia and Singapore 350 400\nRussia and Kazakhstan 530 730\nEurope 870 1,060\nIndia 300 410\nTotal 32,410 38,660\n1 United States, Canada, Mexico and Peru\n2 Substantially all of our Hong Kong revenues are derived from the sale of products that are delivered to members in China. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nMembers must agree to the terms and conditions of our member agreement posted on our website. The member agreement sets forth our policies and procedures, and\nwe may elect to terminate a member for non-compliance.\nWe pay commissions to eligible members based on product purchases by such members’ down-line customers and members during a given commission period. To be\neligible to receive commissions, members in some countries may be required to make nominal monthly or other periodic purchases of products. See “Working with\nMembers.”\nMembers generally place orders through the internet and pay by credit card prior to shipment. Accordingly, we carry minimal accounts receivable and credit losses\nare historically negligible.\n4\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we modified some of our marketing strategies and programs by offering a hybrid approach of both in-person and virtual or\nonline marketing programs and activities. We generally sponsor promotional meetings, product education, motivational and personal development training events for current\nand potential members. These events are designed to inform and train prospective and existing members about our product lines and new product launches, our latest\nmarketing and promotional plans, and new services improvements. These events also serve as a venue for recognition of member accomplishments. Members typically\nshare their experiences in using our products and developing their business at these events. We are continually developing and updating our marketing strategies and\nprograms to motivate our members.\nRecent Disruptions to our Business\nOur normal business operations have recently been disrupted by a series of events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures to control it, the Chinese\ngovernment’s 100-day campaign focused on companies involved in the sale of health products in China, and recent political and social developments in Hong Kong. See\n“Item 1A. Risk Factors - Epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war…”, “Risk Factors - Our business in China\nis subject to compliance with a myriad of applicable laws and regulations...”, “Risk Factors - Our Hong Kong operations are being adversely affected by recent political and\nsocial developments in Hong Kong…”, and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Overview.”\nManagement Information Systems\nOur business uses a proprietary web-based system to process orders and to communicate bonus volume activity and commissions to members. We have automated a\nsubstantial amount of our financial reporting processes through implementation of Oracle’s E-Business Suite, and have integrated other critical business processes such as\ninventory management, purchasing and costing in our most significant markets.\nEmployees\nAt December 31, 2023, we employed 139 individuals, including 138 total full-time employees worldwide. Of the full-time employees, 86 were located in Greater\nChina (Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan), 31 in the Americas (United States, Canada, Cayman Islands, and Peru), seven in India, five in Europe, three in Japan, two in\nMalaysia and Singapore, and two in each of South Korea and Russia.\nSeasonality\nFrom quarter to quarter, we are somewhat impacted by seasonal factors and trends such as major cultural events and vacation patterns. For example, most Asian\nmarkets celebrate their respective local New Year in the first quarter. This generally has a significant impact on the services of our third-party providers, and can negatively\nimpact our net sales. We believe that net sales can also be negatively impacted during the third quarter, when many of our members traditionally take time off for vacations.\nIn addition, the national holidays in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan in early October tend to have an adverse effect on sales in those markets.\nOur spending, as well as to some extent revenue, is affected by the major events planned at different times of the year. A major promotional event could significantly\nincrease the reported expenses during the quarter in which the event actually takes place, while the revenue that might be generated by the event may not occur in the same\nreporting period.\nIntellectual Property\nMost of our products are packaged under a “private label” arrangement. We have obtained or applied for trademark registration for certain names, logos and various\nproduct names in several countries in which we are doing business or considering expanding. We also rely on common law trademark rights to protect our unregistered\ntrademarks. These common law trademark rights do not provide us with the same level of protection as afforded by a United States federal trademark. Common law\ntrademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually utilized, while a United States federal registration of a trademark enables the registrant\nto discontinue the unauthorized use of the trademark by a third party anywhere in the United States even if the registrant has never used the trademark in the geographic\narea where the trademark is being used; provided, however, that the unauthorized third party user has not, prior to the registration date, perfected its common law rights in\nthe trademark within that geographic area.\nWe have United States and foreign holding and operating company structures for our businesses, which involve the division of our United States and non-United\nStates operations. Under this structure, the foreign holding company retains the economic ownership of the intangible property outside of the United States, including\ntrademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary information.\n5\nTable of Contents\nWorking with Members\nSponsorship\nEnrolling new members creates multiple levels in our direct selling structure. The persons that a member enrolls within the network are referred to as “sponsored”\nmembers, who may purchase product solely for their own personal consumption, for resale, or both. Persons newly enrolled are assigned into network positions that can be\n“under” other members, and thus they can be called “down-line” members. If down-line members also enroll new members, they create additional levels within the\nstructure, but their down-line members remain in the same down-line network as the original member that introduced them to our business.\nWhile we provide informational brochures and other sales materials, members are primarily responsible for enrolling and educating their new members with respect\nto products, the compensation plan and how to build a successful membership network.\nMembers are not required to enroll other members as their down-line, and we do not pay any commissions for enrolling new members. However, because of the\nfinancial incentives provided to those who succeed in building a member network that consumes and resells products, we believe that many of our members attempt, with\nvarying degrees of effort and success, to enroll additional members. Because they are seeking new opportunities for supplemental income, people are often attracted to\nbecome members after using our products or after attending introductory seminars. Once a person becomes a member, he or she is able to purchase products directly from\nus at wholesale or discounted prices via the internet. The member is also entitled to enroll other members in order to build a network of members and customers.\nIn certain markets members also enroll preferred customers. Preferred customers purchase products at a discount but are not able to enroll new members or preferred\ncustomers, resell product, earn commissions or qualify for incentives or rewards.\nCompensation Plans\nWe employ what is commonly referred to as a binary compensation plan, enhanced with certain unilevel features. Under our compensation plan, members are paid\nweekly commissions by our subsidiary in which they are enrolled for product purchases by their down-line member network across all geographic markets. Our China\nsubsidiary maintains an e-commerce retail platform and does not pay commissions, although our Chinese members may participate in our compensation plan through our\nother subsidiaries. This “seamless” compensation plan enables a member located in one country to sponsor other members located in other countries. Currently, there are\nbasically two ways in which members can earn income:\n• Through commissions paid on the accumulated bonus volume from product purchases made by their down-line members and customers; and\n• Through retail profits on sales of products purchased by members at discount and wholesale prices and resold at retail prices (for purchasers in some of our smaller\nmarkets and purchasers from our China subsidiary, sales are for personal consumption only and income may not be earned through retail profits).\nEach of our products is designated a specified number of bonus volume points. Commissions are based on total personal and group bonus volume points per sales\nperiod. Bonus volume points are essentially a percentage of a product’s wholesale price. As the member’s business expands, the member receives higher commissions from\npurchases made by an expanding down-line network. To be eligible to receive commissions, a member may be required to make nominal monthly or other periodic\npurchases of our products. Certain of our subsidiaries do not require these nominal purchases for a member to be eligible to receive commissions. In determining\ncommissions, the number of levels of down-line members included within the member’s commissionable group increases as the number of memberships directly below the\nmember increases. Under our current compensation plan, some of our commission payout may be limited to a hard cap dollar amount per week or a specific percentage of\nthe total product sales. In some markets, commissions may be further limited.\nIn some markets, we also pay certain bonuses on purchases by up to three generations of personally sponsored members, as well as bonuses on commissions earned\nby up to seven generations of personally sponsored members. Members can also earn income, trips and other prizes in specific time-limited promotions and contests we\nhold from time to time.\nOccasionally, we make modifications and enhancements to our compensation plan to help motivate members, which can have an impact on member commissions. We\nmay also enter into agreements for business or market development, which could result in additional compensation to specific members.\n6\nTable of Contents\nMember Support\nWe are committed to providing a high level of support services tailored to the needs of our members in each market we are serving. We attempt to meet the needs and\nbuild the loyalty of members by providing personalized member services and by maintaining a generous product return policy (see “Product Warranties and Returns”). We\nbelieve that maximizing a member’s efforts by providing effective member support has been, and could continue to be, important to our success.\nWe seek to understand and satisfy the needs of our members through virtual and in-person product training meetings, significant member events, web-based\nmessages, member focus groups, regular telephone conference calls and other personal contacts with members. Via our platform, we may provide product fulfillment and\ntracking services that result in user-friendly and timely product distribution.\nTo help maintain communication with our members, we offer the following support programs:\n• Teleconferences – we hold teleconferences with member field leadership on various subjects such as technical product discussions, member organization building\nand management techniques.\n• Internet – we maintain a website at www.nhtglobal.com. On this website, the user can read company news, learn more about various products, sign up to be a\nmember, place orders, and track the fulfillment and delivery of their orders.\n• Product Tools – we offer a variety of marketing tools to members, including product catalogs, videos, informational brochures, pamphlets and posters for\nindividual products, which are both printed and available online.\n• Broadcast E-mail and Text Messages – we send announcements via e-mail and/or text messages to members who opt in to receive this form of communication.\n• Social Media Tools – in some countries we maintain country-specific social media sites to foster a community environment around our product offering and\nbusiness opportunity.\nTechnology and Internet Initiatives\nWe believe that the internet is important to our business as more consumers communicate online and purchase products over the internet as opposed to traditional\nretail and direct sales channels. As a result, we have committed significant resources to our e-commerce capabilities and the abilities of our members to take advantage of\nthe internet. Substantially all of our sales take place via the internet. We offer a global platform that allows a member to have a personalized replicating website through\nwhich he or she can sell products in all of the countries in which we do business. Links to these websites can be found at our main website for members at\nwww.nhtglobal.com. The information provided on these websites should not be considered part of this report.\nRules Affecting Members\nOur member policies and procedures establish the rules that members must follow in each market. We also monitor member activity in an attempt to provide our\nmembers with a “level playing field” so that one member may not be disadvantaged by the activities of another. We require our members to present products and business\nopportunities in an ethical and professional manner. Members further agree that their presentations to customers must be consistent with, and limited to, the product claims\nand representations made in our literature.\nOur policies and procedures require that we produce or pre-approve all sales aids used by members such as presentations, videos, audio recordings, brochures and\npromotional clothing. Further, members may not use any form of media advertising to promote products unless it is pre-approved by us. Members are not entitled to use our\ntrademarks or other intellectual property without our prior consent. If we are made aware of unapproved materials being used, we notify and direct the relevant members to\ncease using such materials. In addition to regularly communicating to our members what is and is not appropriate to say about product or income claims, we have engaged a\nthird-party service provider to assist us in monitoring the internet and various social media to identify potential misconduct or violations of our policies and procedures.\nOur compliance and member services department reviews reports of alleged member misbehavior. If we determine that a member has violated our member policies or\nprocedures, we may terminate the member’s rights completely. Alternatively, we may impose sanctions, such as warnings, probation, withdrawal or denial of an award,\nsuspension of privileges of the membership, fines, withholding commissions, until specified conditions are satisfied or other appropriate injunctive relief. Virtually all of our\nmembers are independent contractors, not employees, and may act independently of us. Further, our members may resign or terminate their membership at any time without\nnotice. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our recent loss of a significant number of members is adversely affecting our business...”.\n7\nTable of Contents\nGovernment Regulations\nDirect Selling Activities\nDirect selling, or multi-level marketing, activities are regulated by various federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States and other countries.\nThese laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes. The laws and regulations in our current markets often:\n• impose cancellation/product return, inventory buy-backs and cooling-off rights for consumers and members;\n• require us or our members to obtain a license from, or register with, governmental agencies;\n• impose reporting requirements; and\n• impose upon us requirements, such as requiring members to maintain levels of retail sales to qualify to receive commissions, to avoid pyramid schemes by\nensuring that members are being compensated for sales of products and not for recruiting new members.\nThe laws and regulations governing direct selling are modified from time to time, and, like other direct selling companies, we may be subject from time to time to\ngovernment reviews, examinations or investigations in our various markets related to our direct selling activities. This can require us to make changes to our business model\nand aspects of our global compensation plan in the markets impacted by such changes and examinations.\nChina has direct selling and anti-pyramiding regulations that are restrictive and contain various limitations, including a restriction on the ability to pay multi-level\ncompensation to independent members and engage in certain member recruitment activities. The regulatory environment in China is complex, and our business in China can\nreceive regulatory and media attention.\nThe Chinese government scrutinizes activities of direct selling companies. Our business continues to be subject to regulations and examinations by municipal and\nprovincial level regulators. At times, actions by government regulators have impacted our members’ activities in certain locations, and have resulted in a few cases of\nenforcement actions. In each of these cases, we helped our members with their defense in the legality of their conduct. We expect that our business model will continue to\nevolve, as we work with our professional advisors and regulators to make any changes that need to be made to comply with direct selling and other regulations.\nWe believe that neither our Hong Kong-based e-commerce direct selling platform nor our e-commerce retail platform in China require a direct selling license in\nChina, which we currently do not hold. We previously submitted a preliminary application for a direct selling license in China, but in 2019 a Chinese governmental\nauthority recommended that we withdraw our application. We expect to reapply for a direct selling license in China when we believe that circumstances are again ripe for\ndoing so.\nRegulation of Our Products\nOur products and related promotional and marketing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation by numerous governmental agencies and authorities\nin the United States, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety\nCommission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, state attorneys general and other state regulatory agencies. In our foreign markets, the products are generally regulated by\nsimilar government agencies.\n8\nTable of Contents\nOur personal care products are subject to various laws and regulations that regulate cosmetic products and set forth regulations for determining whether a product can\nbe marketed as a “cosmetic” or requires further approval as an over-the-counter (OTC) cosmetic. In the United States, regulation of cosmetics is under the jurisdiction of the\nFDA and the FTC. The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics by their intended use, as “articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on,\nintroduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body . . . for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance.” Among the products included\nin this definition are skin moisturizers, eye and facial makeup preparations, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail polishes, shampoos, permanent waves, hair colors, toothpastes\nand deodorants, as well as any material intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product. Conversely, a product will not be considered a cosmetic, but may be\nconsidered a drug if it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or is intended to affect the structure or any function of the\nbody. A product’s intended use can be surmised from marketing or product claims. The other markets in which we conduct business have similar regulations. Additionally,\nthe requirement that claims for products must be truthful and substantiated is enforced by the FTC.\nIn Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare regulates the sale and distribution of cosmetics and requires us to have an import business license and to register\neach personal care product imported into Japan. In Taiwan, all “medicated” cosmetic products require registration. In China, personal care products are placed into one of\ntwo categories, “general” and “drug.” Products in both categories require submission of formulas and other information with the health authorities, and drug products\nrequire human clinical studies. The product registration process in China for these products can take from nine to more than 18 months or longer. Such regulations in any\ngiven market can limit our ability to import products and can delay product launches as we go through the registration and approval process for those products. The sale of\ncosmetic products is regulated in the European Union under the European Union Cosmetics Directive, which requires a uniform application for foreign companies making\npersonal care product sales. In Peru, this is managed by the governing arm DIGEMID (Dirección General de Medicamentos, Insumos y Drogas) and can take up to three\nmonths to fully register as saleable. Similarly, in Mexico, the governing arm is COFEPRIS (Comisión Federal para la Protección contra Riesgos Sanitarios) and can also\ntake three to six months to fully register as saleable.\nThe markets in which we conduct business all have varied regulations that distinguish foods and nutritional health supplements from “drugs” or “pharmaceutical\nproducts.” Because of the varied regulations, some products or ingredients that are recognized as a “food” in certain markets may be treated as a “pharmaceutical” in other\nmarkets. These regulations may require us to either modify a product or refrain from selling the product in a given market. As a result, we must regularly modify the\ningredients and/or the levels of ingredients in our products to ensure all applicable regulatory restrictions are addressed. In some circumstances, the regulations in foreign\nmarkets may require us to obtain regulatory approval prior to introduction of a new product or limit our uses of certain ingredients altogether. There has been an increased\nmovement in the United States and other markets to expand the regulation of dietary supplements. This could impose additional restrictions or requirements in the\nfuture. Because of this increased regulatory focus, our internal regulatory staff has grown and review efforts have been enhanced in order to comply with our understanding\nof current regulations.\nFDA regulations require current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) for dietary supplements. The regulations seek to ensure personnel are routinely and properly\ntrained, that dietary supplements are produced in a quality manner, do not contain contaminants or impurities, and are accurately labeled. The regulations include\nrequirements for establishing quality control procedures for us and our vendors and suppliers, designing and constructing manufacturing plants, and testing ingredients and\nfinished products. The regulations also include requirements for record keeping and handling consumer product complaints. If dietary supplements contain contaminants or\ndo not contain the type or quantity of dietary ingredient they are represented to contain, the FDA would consider those products to be adulterated or misbranded. We seek to\nensure compliance with all regulatory requirements through our periodic manufacturer and warehouse audits, as well as our corrective action request (CAR) program, if\nneeded. The cGMP also extend to logistics where we seek to minimize any safety risks associated with product distribution.\nOur business is subject to additional FDA regulations, such as those implementing an adverse event reporting system (“AERS”), which requires us to document and\ntrack adverse events and report serious adverse events, which are events involving hospitalization or death, associated with consumers’ use of our products.\n9\nTable of Contents\nMost of our major markets also regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy of products. This is particularly true with respect to our dietary\nsupplements because we typically market them as foods or health functional foods. For example, in the United States, we are unable to claim that any of our nutritional\nsupplements will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent disease. In the United States, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, however, permits substantiated,\ntruthful and non-misleading statements of nutritional support to be made in labeling, such as statements describing general well-being resulting from consumption of a\ndietary ingredient or the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in affecting or maintaining a structure or a function of the body. Most of the other markets in which we\nconduct business have not adopted similar legislation, so distribution of U.S. products may be subject to more restrictive limitations on the claims we can make about our\nproducts in these markets.\nChina’s 100-Day Campaign Focusing on Health Products and Services\nIn January 2019 the Chinese government announced a 100-day campaign focusing on companies involved in the sale of food, equipment, daily necessities, small\nhome electrical appliances and services that are claimed to promote health. The Chinese government ministries in charge of this campaign indicated that they were targeting\nillegal practices in the industry, particularly the manufacture and sale of counterfeit and substandard products, and false advertising and misleading claims as to the health\nbenefits of products and services. It is understood that the campaign was specifically focused on the business practices of direct selling companies. Although the 100-day\ncampaign was due to expire in April 2019, we are not aware of any information indicating that the campaign has formally concluded. However, the Chinese government\nsubsequently announced that it would conduct a “look-back review” to evaluate the 100-day campaign. As part of this review, we understand that various Chinese\ngovernmental agencies formed a working group to assess the 100-day campaign, particularly focusing on the health market and its supervision in certain provinces. We\nunderstand that during September 2019 the working group evaluated the performance and results of a number of organizations and governmental departments in these\nprovinces and made recommendations for various improvements. It was noted that each province had opened a number of investigative cases, had successfully closed\nnumerous cases, and had imposed various fines and penalties. We understand that the look-back review continued after September 2019, and we are not aware that this\nreview has been completed. As a result, the business environment in China for health product companies continues to be challenging, which has been exacerbated by\nnegative social media sentiment expressed for these types of companies.\nThe 100-day campaign, including its extension and aftermath, has and is expected to continue negatively impacting our business in China in the near-term, but we\nbelieve will ultimately benefit us and Chinese consumers in the long-term as purveyors of substandard products are driven from the market. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors -\nOur business in China is subject to compliance with a myriad of applicable laws and regulations...” and “Item 7. - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations - Business Overview.”\nOther Regulatory Issues\nAs we operate through many subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions, we are subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing and custom laws that regulate the flow\nof funds between our entities for product purchases, management services and contractual obligations, such as the payment of member commissions. As is the case with\nmost companies that operate in direct sales, we might receive inquiries or scrutiny from time to time from government regulatory authorities regarding the nature of our\nbusiness and other issues, such as compliance with local direct selling, pyramid selling, transfer pricing, customs, taxation, foreign exchange control, securities and other\nlaws. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Legal, Regulatory, Tax, Currency and Trade Policy Risks.”\nProduct Warranties and Returns\nOur refund policies and procedures closely follow industry and country-specific standards, which vary greatly by country. For example, in the United States, the\nDirect Selling Association recommends that direct sellers permit returns during the twelve-month period following the sale, while in Hong Kong the standard return policy\nis 14 days following the sale. Our return policies typically conform to local laws or the recommendation of the local direct selling association. In most cases, members who\ntimely return unopened product that is in resalable condition may receive a refund. The amount of the refund may be dependent on the country in which the sale occurred,\nthe timeliness of the return, and any applicable re-stocking fee. We must be notified of the return in writing and such written requests would be considered a termination\nnotice of the membership. We may alter our return policy in response to special circumstances.\n10\nTable of Contents\nSignificant Customers\nSales are made to our members and no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales. However, our business model can result in a concentration of\nsales to several different members and their network of members. Although no single member accounted for 10% or more of net sales, the loss of a key member or that\nmember’s network could have an adverse effect on our net sales and financial results.\nOur Industry\nWe are engaged in the direct selling industry, selling wellness, herbal, beauty, lifestyle, home, and daily products. More specifically, we are engaged in what is called\nnetwork marketing or multi-level marketing. This type of organizational structure and approach to marketing and sales include companies selling lifestyle enhancement\nproducts, cosmetics and dietary supplements, or selling other types of consumer products. Generally, direct selling is based upon an organizational structure in which\nindependent members purchasing a company’s products are compensated for sales made directly to consumers.\nOur members are compensated based on sales generated by members they have enrolled and all subsequent members enrolled by their “down-line” network of\nmembers. The experience of the direct selling industry has been that once a sizeable network of members is established, new and alternative products and services can be\noffered to those members for sale to consumers and additional members.\nCompetition\nThe network marketing industry is very diverse, with giant multinational corporations as well as smaller, local operators, some of which are direct-selling subsidiaries\nof much larger conglomerates. Big network marketing companies include Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc., USANA Health Sciences, Inc., and Herbalife Nutrition Ltd., which\nhave much greater name recognition and financial resources than we do and also have many more members. They are publicly traded and therefore serve as informational\nbenchmarks, but we don’t overlap with them in terms of marketplace or product range. On the other hand, many medium- and small-sized privately held Chinese,\nTaiwanese and Hong Kong companies are fierce competitors and are much closer to directly competing with us. Also, a number of our former employees and members now\nwork for competitors and sometimes try to use relationships and knowledge obtained to compete with us.\nOur ability to compete with other network marketing companies depends, in significant part, on our success in attracting and retaining members. There can be no\nassurance that our programs for attracting and retaining members will be successful. The pool of individuals interested in network marketing is limited in each market and\nis reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully attract these individuals into their businesses. Although we believe that we offer an attractive\nopportunity for our members, there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit our existing members or deplete the pool of\npotential members in a given market.\nThe direct selling channel tends to sell products at a higher price compared to traditional retailers, which poses a degree of competitive risk. There is no assurance that\nwe would continue to compete effectively against retail stores, internet-based retailers or other direct sellers.\n11\nTable of Contents\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are exposed to a variety of risks that are present in our business and industry. The following are some of the more significant factors that could affect our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nBusiness, Product and Market Risks\nBecause our Hong Kong operations account for a substantial portion of our overall business, and substantially all of our Hong Kong business is derived from the\nsale of products to members in China, any material adverse change in our business relating to either Hong Kong or China would likely have a material adverse\nimpact on our overall business.\nIn 2023 and 2022, approximately 79% and 78% of our revenue was generated in Hong Kong, respectively. Substantially all of our Hong Kong revenues are derived\nfrom the sale of products that are delivered to members in China. This geographic concentration in our business means that events or conditions that could negatively impact\nthis geographic region or our operations in this region, including the current economic challenges facing China and Hong Kong, are having and could in the future have a\ngreater adverse impact upon our overall business and financial results than would be the case with a company having greater geographic diversification.\nOur Hong Kong operations are being adversely affected by recent political and social developments in Hong Kong, and the negative impact on our operations and\nfinancial performance could continue or intensify.\nOur headquarters and a significant number of our employees are based in Hong Kong, and our Hong Kong subsidiary generates a substantial portion of our overall\nbusiness. Hong Kong has in recent years experienced significant political unrest and social strife, including a series of large-scale protests. These developments, along with\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, led us in 2020 to cease conducting member meetings and events in Hong Kong. Inasmuch as member meetings and events located\nin Hong Kong have in the past served as an important component of our product marketing and distribution efforts, we believe that these developments have negatively\naffected our operations and financial performance. Although we were able to sponsor a large in-person member event in Hong Kong in the fourth quarter of 2023, it is too\nearly to predict whether these developments will continue to adversely affect our overall business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe experienced negative operating cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and only modest positive operating cash flows during the\nyears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Unless our operating cash flows improve, this negative financial performance could have a material adverse effect on\nour business and our stock price.\nWe experienced negative operating cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and only modest positive operating cash flows during the years\nended December 31, 2021 and 2020. This cash flow performance was primarily due to declines in our revenues being greater than the decreases in expenditures that we\ncould manage. If we again experience negative operating cash flows or our cash balance is substantially diminished, we may not be able to continue paying cash dividends\nto our stockholders, our ability to support our operations could be impaired and we may be required to seek debt or equity financing. However, we may not be able to obtain\nadditional debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, and any new financing could have a dilutive effect to our existing stockholders. Negative operating cash\nflows could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our stock price, and could eventually threaten our\nsolvency. Negative operating cash flows and any related adverse market perception may also negatively affect our ability to attract new members and/or sell our products.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining an adequate level of cash resources.\nAdverse publicity associated with our products, ingredients or network marketing program, or those of similar companies, could harm our financial condition and\noperating results.\nAdverse publicity concerning any actual or claimed failure by us or our members to comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding product claims and\nadvertising, good manufacturing practices, the regulation of our network marketing program, the licensing and distribution of our products for sale in our target markets or\nother aspects of our business, whether or not resulting in enforcement actions or the imposition of penalties, could have an adverse effect on our goodwill and could\nnegatively affect our ability to attract, motivate and retain members, which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue. There have been several\ninstances where adverse publicity in China has harmed our business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our business in China is subject to compliance with a myriad of\napplicable laws and regulations…”.\nIn addition, our members’ and consumers’ perception of the safety and quality of our products and ingredients, as well as similar products and ingredients distributed\nby other companies, can be significantly influenced by media attention, publicized scientific research or findings, widespread product liability claims and other publicity\nconcerning our products or ingredients or similar products and ingredients distributed by other companies. Adverse publicity, whether or not accurate or resulting from\nconsumers’ use or misuse of our products, that associates consumption of our products or ingredients or any similar products or ingredients with illness or other adverse\neffects, questions the benefits of our or similar products or claims that any such products are ineffective, inappropriately labeled or have inaccurate instructions as to their\nuse, could negatively impact our reputation or the market demand for our products.\nOur business and financial performance may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment.\nWe operate globally, and as a result, our business and revenues are impacted by global economic and geopolitical conditions. The instability in global financial\nmarkets, inflation, shortages and delays related to global supply chain challenges, uncertainties related to the imposition and lifting of governmental restrictions to mitigate\nthe spread of COVID-19, the current economic challenges in China, changes in government policies, geopolitical turmoil and other disruptions to global and regional\neconomies and markets continue to add uncertainty to global economic conditions. The continuing effect of any or all of these events could adversely impact demand for\nour products, harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n12\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of revenue diversification.\nAlthough we have in recent years expanded our line of products, we derive at least 10% of our total revenue from each of our Premium Noni Juice and Triotein™\nproducts, as well as our line of probiotic products comprised of Enhanced Essential Probiotics and Biotic Trio. Further, we currently source each of these products from a\nsingle supplier. If demand decreases significantly, government regulation restricts their sale, we are unable to adequately source or deliver the products, or we are unable to\noffer the products for any reason without suitable replacements, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Our\nfuture success will also depend on our ability to reduce our dependence on these few products by developing and introducing new products and product or feature\nenhancements in a timely manner. Even if we are able to develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements, they may not achieve market acceptance and\nthe revenue generated from these new products and enhancements may not offset the costs, which could substantially impair our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nEpidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility may seriously harm our business.\nEpidemics, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility may cause damage or disruption to us, our employees, our facilities and our members and\ncustomers, which could negatively impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. For example, in late 2019 or early 2020 an outbreak of COVID-\n19 was first identified in China and subsequently spread around the world, being declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. The\noutbreak caused the Chinese government to implement powerful measures to control the virus, such as requiring businesses to close throughout areas of China and\nrestricting public gatherings and certain travel within the country. We have significant business in China and in 2023 generated approximately 79% of our revenue in Hong\nKong, substantially all of which was derived from the sale of products to members in China. The Chinese and Hong Kong governments, like the governments of other\ncountries in which we operate, continue to adjust the restrictive measures that they impose to control COVID-19 based on then-current local circumstances; however, it\nshould be noted that the Chinese and Hong Kong governments imposed some of the most restrictive COVID-19 control measures of any country in the world. While the\nChinese and Hong Kong governments took comprehensive steps to relax many of their COVID-19 control measures in late 2022, these disruptions materially negatively\nimpacted our financial results from 2020 through 2022. This less restrictive business environment continued throughout 2023. We are hopeful that this improved state of\naffairs will enable us to continue more normal operations in China and Hong Kong, but it is still too early to accurately predict the impact on us of this relaxation of control\nmeasures and whether it will prove enduring. Ultimately, the severity of the impact on us of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, including the\nduration and spread of the virus, and related control measures, which we are unable to accurately predict.\nThis and other epidemics, such as the avian influenza, or natural disasters have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business, results of operations\nand financial condition. Terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and acts of war or hostility could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict. For example, the imposition of sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of\nUkraine in 2022 required that we alter some of our operations in our Russia and Kazakhstan market, including ceasing to sell certain of our products in that market. While\nour Russia and Kazakhstan market comprises a relatively small part of our business, terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility that directly implicate our business in Hong\nKong and China, such as challenges to Chinese sovereignty claims in the South China Sea or Chinese objection to the Taiwan independence movement and the resultant\ntension in the Taiwan Strait, could have a much more material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe high level of competition in our industry could adversely affect our business.\nThe business of marketing personal care, cosmetic, nutritional supplements, and lifestyle enhancement products is highly competitive. This market segment includes\nnumerous manufacturers, members, marketers, and retailers that actively compete for the business of consumers both in the United States and abroad. The market is highly\nsensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. Sales of similar products by competitors may materially and\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to significant competition for the recruitment of members from other direct selling organizations, including those that market similar products. Many\nof our competitors are substantially larger than we are, offer a wider array of products, have far greater financial resources and many more active members than we\nhave. Even more numerous are those medium- and small-sized privately held Chinese, Taiwanese and Hong Kong companies, some of which are direct-selling subsidiaries\nof much larger conglomerates, that are fierce competitors and are much closer to directly competing with us. Our ability to remain competitive depends, in significant part,\non our success in recruiting and retaining members with our products, attractive compensation plan and other incentives. We believe that we have an attractive product line\nand that our compensation and incentive programs provide our members with significant earning potential. However, we cannot be sure that our programs for recruitment\nand retention of members will be successful.\nSome of our competitors have employed or otherwise contracted for the services of our former officers, employees, consultants, and members, who may try to use\ninformation and contacts obtained while under contract with us for competitive advantage. While we seek to protect our information through contractual and other means,\nthere can be no assurance that we will timely learn of such activity, have the resources to attempt to stop it, or have adequate remedies available to us.\nFailure of new products to gain member and market acceptance could harm our business.\nAn important component of our business is our ability to develop new products that create enthusiasm among our member force. If we fail to introduce new products\non a timely basis, our member productivity could be harmed. In addition, if any new products fail to gain market acceptance, are restricted by regulatory requirements, or\nhave quality problems, this would harm our results of operations. Factors that could affect our ability to continue to introduce new products include, among others, limited\ncapital and human resources, government regulations, proprietary protections of competitors that may limit our ability to offer comparable products and any failure to\nanticipate changes in consumer tastes and buying preferences.\n13\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on a limited number of independent third parties to manufacture and supply our products on a timely basis.\nAll of our products are manufactured by a limited number of independent third parties. There is no assurance that our current manufacturers will continue to reliably\nsupply products to us at the level of quality we require or to do so on a timely basis. Some of our third-party manufacturers experience difficulty sourcing product\ningredients or components on a timely basis, which can result in delays in the timely delivery of products to us. If a key manufacturer suffers liquidity problems or\nexperiences operational or other problems assisting with our products, our results could suffer. In the event any of our third-party manufacturers become unable or\nunwilling to timely provide the products in required volumes and quality levels at acceptable prices, we will be required to identify and obtain acceptable replacement\nmanufacturing sources or replacement products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative manufacturing sources or products or be able to do so on a\ntimely basis. An extended interruption in the supply of certain of our products may result in a substantial loss of revenue. In addition, any actual or perceived degradation\nof product quality as a result of our reliance on third-party manufacturers may have an adverse effect on revenue or result in increased product returns.\nGrowth may be impeded by the political and economic risks of entering and operating in foreign markets.\nOur ability to achieve future growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to continue our international expansion efforts. However, there can be no assurance that we\nwould be able to grow in our existing international markets, enter new international markets on a timely basis, or that new markets would be profitable. We must overcome\nsignificant regulatory and legal barriers before we can begin marketing in any foreign market.\nAlso, it is difficult to assess the extent to which our products and sales techniques would be accepted or successful in any given country. In addition to significant\nregulatory barriers, we may also encounter problems conducting operations in foreign markets with different cultures and legal systems from those elsewhere. There are\nsubstantial uncertainties in many such legal systems around the world, including in China, which could limit our ability to enforce third-party contractual arrangements and\nhave other negative consequences. We may also be required to reformulate certain of our products before commencing sales in a given country. Once we have entered a\nmarket, we seek to adhere to the regulatory and legal requirements of that market. No assurance can be given that we would be able to successfully reformulate our\nproducts in any of our current or potential international markets to meet local regulatory requirements or attract local customers. The failure to do so could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain and retain necessary permits and\napprovals.\nIn many markets, other direct selling companies already have significant market penetration, the effect of which could be to desensitize the local member population\nto a new opportunity or to make it more difficult for us to recruit qualified members. There can be no assurance that, even if we are able to commence operations in foreign\ncountries, there would be a sufficiently large population of potential members inclined to participate in a direct selling system offered by us. We believe our future success\ncould depend in part on our ability to seamlessly integrate our business methods, including member compensation plan, across all markets in which our products are\nsold. There can be no assurance that we would be able to further develop and maintain a seamless compensation program.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively impact our business and the market price of\nour common stock.\nWe are required by federal securities laws to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\n(“Sarbanes-Oxley”), which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal controls are\nnecessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. The SEC’s Sarbanes-Oxley rules require us to include a report by management on the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K. Although we review internal control over financial reporting in order to\nensure compliance with the SEC’s Sarbanes-Oxley rules, if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we could be required to take costly and\ntime-consuming corrective measures to remedy any number of deficiencies, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, be required to restate the affected historical\nfinancial statements, be subjected to investigations and/or sanctions by federal and state securities regulators, and be subjected to civil lawsuits by stockholders. For\ninstance, as described in “Item 9A. - Controls and Procedures” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2018, we identified\na material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. Management, with oversight from the Audit Committee, implemented a plan\nto remediate this material weakness and completed remediation during 2019. While the existence of this material weakness did not result in a restatement of previously\nissued interim or annual consolidated financial statements, we incurred substantial costs and utilized meaningful resources to remediate the material weakness during 2019.\nAny future failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in the foregoing identified consequences and could cause investors to lose\nconfidence in our reported financial information and in our company and could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nManagement and Member Network Risks\nWe could be adversely affected by management changes or an inability to attract and retain key management, directors and consultants.\nWe incur a low level of overhead and are run by a small number of executives, who rely on a small group of employees. Our future success depends to a significant\ndegree on the skills, experience and efforts of our top management and directors. We also depend on the ability of our executive officers and other members of senior\nmanagement to work effectively as a team. The loss of one or more of our executive officers, members of our senior management or directors could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, as our business evolves, we may require additional or different management members,\ndirectors or consultants, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate, attract and retain them if and when they are needed.\n14\nTable of Contents\nOur recent loss of a significant number of members is adversely affecting our business, and if we cannot stabilize or increase the number of members our business\ncould be further negatively impacted.\nWe distribute our products through independent members, and we depend upon them directly for all of our sales in most of our markets. Accordingly, our success\ndepends in significant part upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate a large base of members, as well as a relatively small number of key members. Our members may\nterminate their services with us at any time and, like most direct selling organizations, we have a high rate of attrition. We had 16% fewer active members at December 31,\n2023 as compared to the end of 2022, and 16% fewer active members at the end of 2022 as compared to the end of 2021. These losses in the number of active members\nwere a significant factor contributing to the decrease in our recent year-over-year sales. If we cannot stabilize or increase the number of our members, or if we lose one or\nmore key member leaders, sales of our products could be further materially and adversely affected. The replacement of members could be difficult because, in our efforts to\nattract and retain members, we compete with other direct selling organizations, including but not limited to those in the personal care, cosmetic product and nutritional\nsupplement industries.\nOur number of active members or their productivity could further decline in the future. We cannot accurately predict fluctuations in the number or the productivity of\nmembers because we primarily rely upon existing members to train new members and to motivate new and existing members. Operating results could be adversely affected\nif our existing and new business opportunities and products do not generate sufficient economic incentive or interest to retain existing members and to attract new members.\nThe number and productivity of our members could be harmed by several factors, including:\n• adverse publicity or negative perceptions regarding us, our products, our method of distribution or our competitors;\n• lack of interest in, or the technical failure of, existing or new products;\n• lack of interest in our existing compensation plan for members or in enhancements or other changes to that compensation plan;\n• our actions to enforce our policies and procedures;\n• regulatory actions or charges or private actions against us or others in our industry, such as the 100-day campaign initiated in China in January 2019 (as well as\nits extension and aftermath, including the related look-back review);\n• general economic, business and political conditions, including the recent political unrest in Hong Kong and the imposition of restrictive measures that curtail\nperson-to-person interactions, as recently experienced resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic;\n• increased use of social sharing channels, which may allow members to more easily engage with their customers and other members in other opportunities;\n• changes in management or the loss of one or more key member leaders;\n• entry of new competitors, or new products or compensation plan enhancements by existing competitors, in our markets; and\n• potential saturation or maturity levels in a given country or market which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain members in such market.\nAlthough virtually all of our members are independent contractors, improper member actions that violate laws or regulations could harm our business.\nVirtually all of our members are independent contractors and, accordingly, we are not in a position to directly provide the same direction, motivation and oversight as\nwe would if these members were our own employees. As a result, there can be no assurance that our members will participate in our marketing strategies or plans, accept\nour introduction of new products, or comply with our member policies and procedures. Extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws regulate our business, our products\nand our network marketing program. Because we operate in a number of foreign countries, our policies and procedures for our members differ due to the different legal\nrequirements of each country in which we do business. While we have implemented member policies and procedures designed to govern member conduct and to protect the\ngoodwill associated with our trademarks and trade names, it can be difficult to enforce these policies and procedures because of the large number of members and their\nindependent status.\n15\nTable of Contents\nGiven the size and diversity of our member force, we experience problems with members from time to time, especially with respect to our members in foreign\nmarkets. For example, if our members engage in illegal activities in China, those actions could be attributed to us. Chinese laws regarding how and when members may\nassemble and the activities that they may conduct, or the conditions under which the activities may be conducted, are subject to significant regulatory discretion resulting in\ninterpretations and enforcement that sometimes vary from province to province, among different levels of government, and from time to time. Members can be accused of\nviolating one or more of the laws regulating these activities, notwithstanding training that we attempt to provide. Enforcement measures regarding these violations, which\ncan include arrests, raise the uncertainty and perceived risk associated with conducting this business, especially among those who are aware of the enforcement actions but\nnot the specific activities leading to the enforcement action. We believe that this has led some existing members in China (who are signed up as members in Hong Kong) to\nleave the business or curtail their selling activities and has led some potential members to choose not to participate. Among other things, we are managing this risk with\nmore training and public relations efforts that are designed, among other things, to distinguish our company from businesses that make no attempt to comply with the law.\nThis environment creates uncertainty about the future of doing this type of business in China generally and under our current business model, specifically.\nIn addition, members often desire to enter a market before we have received approval to do business in order to gain an advantage in the marketplace. Improper\nmember activity in new geographic markets could result in adverse publicity and can be particularly harmful to our ability to ultimately enter these markets. Violations by\nour members of applicable law or of our policies and procedures in dealing with customers could reflect negatively on our products and operations, and harm our business\nreputation. In addition, it is possible that a judicial or administrative body could hold us civilly or criminally accountable based on vicarious liability because of the actions\nof our members. If any of the above or related events involving our members occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely\naffected.\nAn increase in the amount of compensation paid to members would reduce profitability.\nWe incur significant expense in the payment of compensation to our members, which represented approximately 42% of net sales during each of 2023 and 2022. We\ncompensate our members by paying commissions, bonuses, and certain awards and prizes. Factors impacting the overall commission payout include the growth and depth\nof the member network, the member retention rate, the type and scope of promotions and incentives, local promotional programs and business development\nagreements. Long-term promotions and incentives (lasting up to one year) can, in particular, result in uncertain ultimate cost. Any increase in compensation payments to\nmembers as a percentage of net sales will reduce our profitability.\nOur compensation plan includes a cap that may be enforced on member compensation paid out on a weekly dollar limit or as a percentage of product sales. There can\nbe no assurance that enforcement of this cap will ensure profitability (which depends on many other factors). Moreover, enforcement of this cap could cause key members\naffected by the cap to leave and join other companies.\nWe may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our members and service providers, which could harm our financial\ncondition and operating results.\nOur members and service providers are subject to taxation, and in some instances, legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect the\ntaxes, such as value added taxes, and to maintain appropriate records. In addition, we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security\nand similar taxes with respect to our members.\nLegal, Regulatory, Tax, Currency and Trade Policy Risks\nOur business in China is subject to compliance with a myriad of applicable laws and regulations, and any actual or alleged violations of those laws or government\nactions otherwise directed at us could have a material adverse impact on our business and the value of our company.\nIn contrast to our operations in other parts of the world, our China subsidiary has not implemented a direct sales model in China. The Chinese government permits\ndirect selling only by organizations that have a license and has also adopted anti-pyramid selling and multi-level marketing legislation. We operate an e-commerce direct\nselling platform in Hong Kong and recognize the revenue derived from sales to both Hong Kong and Chinese members as being generated in Hong Kong. Products\npurchased by members in China are delivered to third parties that act as the importers of record under agreements to pay applicable duties. In addition, through a Chinese\nentity, we sell products in China using an e-commerce retail platform. Chinese members may elect to participate in either or both of the Chinese entity and the Hong Kong\nentity.\n16\nTable of Contents\nWe previously submitted a preliminary application for a direct selling license in China, but in 2019 a Chinese governmental authority recommended that we withdraw\nour application. We expect to reapply for a direct selling license in China when we believe that circumstances are again ripe for doing so. We are unable to predict whether\nand when we will be successful in obtaining a direct selling license to operate in China, and if we are successful, when we will be permitted to conduct direct selling\noperations and whether such operations would be profitable.\nWe continually evaluate our business in China and Hong Kong for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including seeking the input of outside\nprofessionals and certain Chinese authorities. This process can and has resulted in the identification of certain matters of potential noncompliance. We work on a continuing\nbasis to satisfactorily address such matters, however there can be no assurance that adequate steps are taken or that applicable laws and regulations are properly interpreted.\nShould the government authorities determine that our activities violate applicable laws and regulations, including China’s direct selling, pyramid selling or multi-level\nmarketing laws and regulations, or should new laws or regulations be adopted, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Chinese government scrutinizes the activities of direct selling companies. Our business continues to be subject to regulations and examinations by municipal and\nprovincial level regulators. At times, actions by government regulators have impacted our members’ activities in certain locations and have resulted in a few cases of\nenforcement actions. In each of these cases, we helped our members with their defense of the legality of their conduct.\nOur business and the value of our company can be adversely affected by Chinese government scrutiny, even if that scrutiny does not result in investigations of our\nbusiness. Although we remain in regular contact with Chinese government officials and take other steps to address regulatory concerns, these government officials have\nsignificant discretion in the application and enforcement of laws and regulations. As a result, our business and the value of our company remain vulnerable to Chinese\ngovernment scrutiny, whether or not initiated by third parties, which scrutiny could result in changes to our business and/or the Chinese or Hong Kong government taking\naction against us.\nVarious other factors could harm our business in Hong Kong and China, such as worsening economic conditions in Hong Kong or China, adverse developments\nrelating to the industry in which we conduct our business, adverse local publicity, negative changes to our business and/or social media coverage, geopolitical or trade\ntensions between the United States and China or other events that may be out of our control. For example, in January 2019 the Chinese government announced a 100-day\ncampaign focusing on companies involved in the sale of food, equipment, daily necessities, small home electrical appliances and services that are claimed to promote\nhealth. The Chinese government ministries in charge of this campaign indicated that they were targeting illegal practices in the industry, particularly the manufacture and\nsale of counterfeit and substandard products, and false advertising and misleading claims as to the health benefits of products and services. It is understood that the\ncampaign was specifically focused on the business practices of direct selling companies. In January 2019 we, like some of our peers, voluntarily decided to temporarily\nsuspend our member activities, such as product roadshows, product trainings and larger company-sponsored events, in China. We did this because we learned that the 100-\nday campaign was announced in broad outlines by the central government, and the interpretation and enforcement of the campaign was delegated to the provincial and local\ngovernments. We consider it a top priority for our business to develop an understanding of and cooperate with all levels and jurisdictions of the government agencies and\ndid not want to run the risk of being inadvertently entangled in the government enforcement actions as the provincial and local government formulate and implement their\ninterpretive guidance and rule-making. Although we have been able to relax some restrictions on member activities in certain markets, it may again in the future be\nnecessary or advisable to suspend member activities or take similar actions, and the resulting periods of reduced activity may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n17\nTable of Contents\nAlthough the 100-day campaign was due to expire in April 2019, we are not aware of any information indicating that the campaign has formally concluded. However,\nthe Chinese government subsequently announced that it would conduct a “look-back review” to evaluate the 100-day campaign. As part of this review, we understand that\nvarious Chinese governmental agencies formed a working group to assess the 100-day campaign, particularly focusing on the health market and its supervision in certain\nprovinces. We understand that during September 2019 the working group evaluated the performance and results of a number of organizations and governmental departments\nin these provinces and made recommendations for various improvements. It was noted that each province had opened a number of investigative cases, had successfully\nclosed numerous cases, and had imposed various fines and penalties. We understand that the look-back review continued after September 2019, and we are not aware that\nthis review has been completed. As a result, the business environment in China for health product companies continues to be challenging, which has sometimes been\nexacerbated by negative social media sentiment expressed for these types of companies. We believe that the campaign, as well as its extension and aftermath (including the\nlook-back review), will continue to negatively impact our business in China in the near-term, but will ultimately benefit us and Chinese consumers as purveyors of\nsubstandard products are driven from the market.\nAlthough we attempt to work closely with both national and local Chinese governmental agencies in conducting our business, our efforts to comply with national and\nlocal laws may be harmed by a rapidly evolving regulatory climate, concerns about activities resembling violations of direct selling, pyramid selling or multi-level\nmarketing legislation, subjective interpretations of laws and regulations, and activities by individual members that may violate laws notwithstanding our policies prohibiting\nsuch activities.\nAny determination that our operations or activities, or the activities of our individual members, employee sales representatives, or importers of record are not in\ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, extended interruptions of business, restrictions on our future ability to\nobtain business licenses or expand into new locations, changes to our business model, the termination of required licenses to conduct business, or other actions, any of\nwhich could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in government trade and economic policies, including the imposition or threatened imposition of tariffs and other restrictive trade policies, and ongoing\npolitical and economic disputes between the United States and other jurisdictions, particularly China, may have a negative effect on global economic conditions\nand our business, financial results and financial condition.\nThe United States has in recent years enacted tariffs on certain items. Further, there are ongoing discussions and activities regarding changes to other U.S. trade\npolicies and treaties. In response, a number of our markets, particularly China, have implemented tariffs on U.S. imports or otherwise imposed non-tariff barriers such as\nslow-walking custom clearance of American-made products in response to these U.S. actions. These developments, together with the threat of new tariffs and other\nrestrictive trade policies, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and they may significantly reduce\nglobal trade and, in particular, adversely affect trade and economic relations between China and the United States.\nTensions between the United States and China have increased over the past few years as a result of disputes in areas including trade policy, intellectual property,\ncybersecurity and data privacy. Tensions have become particularly acute following the China legislature’s passage of a national security law in June 2020 that changed the\nway Hong Kong has been governed since the territory was handed over by the United Kingdom to China in 1997. This law criminalizes secessionist activities, subversion,\nterrorism, and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security in Hong Kong. The U.S. State Department has announced that the\nUnited States no longer considers Hong Kong to have significant autonomy from China, and the U.S. administration is taking action to end many of the U.S. government’s\nspecial trade and economic relations with Hong Kong. Further, on July 14, 2020 the United States enacted the Hong Kong Autonomy Act (and the U.S. President issued a\nrelated executive order), authorizing the U.S. administration to impose sanctions against individuals and entities determined to materially contribute to the erosion of Hong\nKong's autonomy, as well as to punish financial institutions that facilitate certain significant transactions. The United States has since imposed sanctions on a number of\nindividuals, and China has responded in kind. These and other recent actions may represent an escalation in political and economic tensions involving the United States,\nChina and Hong Kong, which could harm our business. A continued deterioration in these political or economic relations or other future unforeseen problems could disrupt\nour China and Hong Kong business (including our Hong Kong office and employees), adversely affect the distribution of our products, reduce our net sales, increase the\ncost of conducting our operations, or result in retaliatory actions against U.S. interests, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nIn addition, any actions by non-U.S. markets to implement further trade or economic policy changes, including limiting foreign investment or trade, imposing\ncurrency controls restricting the international transfer of funds, increasing regulatory scrutiny or taking other actions which impact U.S. companies' ability to obtain\nnecessary licenses or approvals could negatively impact our business.\n18\nTable of Contents\nTrade and economic policy changes are subject to a number of uncertainties and are only one part of the larger dynamic of political and economic relations amongst\ncountries. The ultimate reaction of other countries, and the individuals in each of these countries, and the impact of actions on the United States, China, Hong Kong, the\nglobal economy and our business, financial condition and results of operations, cannot be predicted at this time.\nDirect-selling laws and regulations may prohibit or severely restrict our direct sales efforts and cause our revenue and profitability to decline, and regulators could\nadopt new regulations that harm our business.\nOur direct selling system is subject to extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints. These laws\nand regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as “pyramid” schemes, which compensate participants for recruiting\nadditional participants irrespective of product sales, use high pressure recruiting methods and/or do not involve legitimate products. They also seek to ensure that claims\nregarding the ability of participants to earn money are truthful and substantiated.\nComplying with these widely varying and sometimes inconsistent rules and regulations can be difficult and may require the devotion of significant resources on our\npart. There can be no assurance that we or our members are in compliance with all of these regulations. Our failure or our members’ failure to comply with these\nregulations or new regulations could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims and could negatively impact our business. If we are unable to continue\nbusiness in existing markets or commence operations in new markets because of these laws, our revenue and profitability may decline.\nWe are also subject to the risk that new laws or regulations might be implemented or that current laws or regulations might change, which could require us to change\nor modify the way we conduct our business in certain markets or the loss of necessary licenses. This could be particularly detrimental to us if we have to change or modify\nthe way we conduct business, or cannot conduct any business, in markets that represent a significant percentage of our revenue.\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws, regulations and other obligations regarding privacy, data protection and information security. Any actual or\nperceived failure by us or our third-party vendors to comply with such laws, regulations or other obligations could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe collect certain personal information, including payment data, from members and consumers, as well as our employees. We also develop and maintain sensitive\nand proprietary business information. We are therefore subject to numerous laws, regulations and other obligations that address privacy, data protection and information\nsecurity in the various markets in which we conduct business. We are particularly focused on the evolving state of laws and regulations in China and Hong Kong\napplicable to privacy, data protection and information security. Of particular note is China's Cyber Security Law, which requires companies to take certain measures to\nensure that the security of their networks and data stored on their networks. Specifically, the Cyber Security Law provides that companies adopt a multi-level protection\nscheme under which network operators are required to perform obligations of security protection to ensure that the network is free from interference, disruption or\nunauthorized access, and prevent network data from being disclosed, stolen or tampered. In addition, on June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People's\nCongress of China promulgated the Data Security Law, which took effect in September 2021. The Data Security Law imposes data security and privacy obligations on\nentities and individuals carrying out data activities, and introduces a data classification and hierarchical protection system based on the importance of data in economic and\nsocial development, as well as the degree of harm it will cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations when\nsuch data is tampered with, destroyed, leaked, or illegally acquired or used. The Data Security Law also provides for a national security review procedure for data activities\nthat may affect national security and imposes export restrictions on certain data and information. Finally, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the\nChina also promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law (\"PIPL\"), which took effect on November 1, 2021. The PIPL expands data protection compliance\nobligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations and individuals in China, and the processing of personal information of persons in\nChina, outside of China if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to, or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, persons in China. The PIPL\nalso provides that critical information infrastructure operators and personal information processing entities that process personal information meeting a volume threshold are\nalso required to store in China personal information generated or collected in China, and to pass a security assessment for any export of such personal information.\nHong Kong also has its data privacy legislation that regulates the collection, use and handling of personal data. Under the relevant Hong Kong legislation, data users\nare required to comply with various data protection principles in relation to the requirement of lawful and fair collection of personal data, consent of data subjects, retention\nof personal data, use and disclosure of personal data, security of personal data, personal data policies and practices, and rights to access and correction of personal data.\nThe interpretation, application and enforcement of privacy, data security and information security laws, regulations and other obligations evolve from time to time\nand their scope may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation and changes in interpretation and enforcement. We have incurred, and\nwill continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with such laws, regulations and other obligations, as well as related security standards and protocols.\nDespite our compliance efforts, we may not meet all of the requirements imposed on us. Any failure on our part or on the part of our third-party vendors to comply with\napplicable laws, regulations or other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security could damage our reputation, result in investigations, fines or\nother penalties imposed by governmental authorities and private claims or litigation, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Even if our practices or those of our third-party vendors are not subject to legal challenge, the perception of data or privacy concerns, whether or not\nvalid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n19\nTable of Contents\nChallenges by third parties to the legality of our business operations could harm our business.\nWe are also subject to the risk of private party challenges to the legality of our operations, including our direct selling system. The regulatory requirements\nconcerning direct selling systems generally do not include “bright line” rules and are inherently fact-based and subject to judicial or administrative interpretation. An\nadverse judicial or administrative determination against us with respect to our direct selling system, or in proceedings not involving us directly but which challenge the\nlegality of other direct selling marketing systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business. There is also risk that challenges and settlements involving other\nparties could provide incentives for similar actions by members against us and other direct selling companies. Moreover, challenges to our business system and operations\nin important markets may come from short sellers, hedge funds, other investors, bloggers and reporters. Other companies in our industry have also faced such\nchallenges. Any challenges regarding us or others in our industry could harm our business if such challenges result in the imposition of any fines or damages on our\nbusiness, create adverse publicity, increase scrutiny or investigations of us or our industry, detrimentally affect our efforts to recruit or motivate members and attract\ncustomers, or interpret laws in a manner inconsistent with our current business practices.\nWe have in the past been involved in, and may in the future face, lawsuits, claims, and governmental proceedings and inquiries that could harm our business.\nWe have in the past been, and may in the future be, a party to lawsuits, claims and governmental proceedings and inquiries. Prosecuting and defending these matters\nmay require significant expense and attention of our management and can expose us to adverse publicity, regardless of the outcome. Further, in the event of an adverse\noutcome, we could be required to pay substantial damages, fines or penalties and cease or be prevented from conducting certain practices or activities.\nSuch matters can be complex, can extend for a protracted period of time, and can result in unpredictable expense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to\nsuccessfully defend or resolve any such litigation, claims or governmental proceedings or inquiries, or that the significant money, time and effort spent in defending these\nmatters, or any related adverse publicity, will not adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could lower our revenue and net income.\nIn 2023, 96% of our revenue was recorded by subsidiaries located outside of North America. Revenue transactions and related commission payments, as well as\nother incurred expenses, are typically denominated in the local currency. Accordingly, our international subsidiaries generally use the local currency as their functional\ncurrency. The results of operations of our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during consolidation since we translate into\nU.S. dollars using the average exchanges rates for the period. As exchange rates vary, revenue and other operating results may differ materially from our\nexpectations. Additionally, we may record significant gains or losses related to foreign-denominated cash and cash equivalents and the re-measurement of inter-company\nbalances.\nOur most significant foreign exchange exposure, the Hong Kong dollar, is for now pegged to the U.S. dollar. We also purchase a significant majority of inventories in\nU.S. dollars. Our foreign currency exchange rate exposure to the South Korean won, Taiwan dollar, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, Russian ruble, Kazakhstani tenge,\nSingaporean dollar, Malaysian ringgit, Thai baht, Indian rupee, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Peruvian sol and European euro collectively represented approximately 18%\nand 19% of our revenue in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our foreign currency exchange rate exposure may increase in the near future as we develop opportunities in\nSoutheast Asia, India, Canada, Central America, South America and Europe. Additionally, our foreign currency exchange rate exposure would significantly increase if the\nHong Kong dollar were no longer pegged to the U.S. dollar. Finally, we also experience indirect exchange rate exposure due to the concentration of our sales to members\nresiding in China and the impact of fluctuations in the value of the Chinese yuan on our members’ purchasing power.\nGiven our inability to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot estimate the effect these fluctuations may have upon future reported results, product\npricing or our overall financial condition. Further, to date we have not attempted to reduce our exposure to short-term exchange rate fluctuations by using foreign currency\nexchange contracts.\n20\nTable of Contents\nChanges in tax or duty laws, and unanticipated tax or duty liabilities, could adversely affect our net income.\nIn the course of doing business we may be subject to various taxes, such as sales and use, value-added, and franchise. We are also subject to income taxes in the\nUnited States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign jurisdictions. Economic and political conditions make tax rules in\nany jurisdiction, including the United States, subject to significant change. There have been recent changes in U.S. tax law that impact how U.S. multinational corporations\nare taxed on foreign earnings. There have also been proposals to reform foreign tax laws that could significantly affect the Company’s tax position. Although we cannot\npredict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense\nand cash flows.\nOur parent corporation is domiciled in the United States. Under tax treaties, we are eligible to receive foreign tax credits in the United States for taxes paid abroad.\nTaxes paid to foreign taxing authorities may exceed the credits available to us, resulting in the payment of a higher overall effective tax rate on our worldwide operations.\nOur effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing\nstatutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around\nthe world.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future be subject to examinations of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax\nauthorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our\nprovision for taxes, which is subject to significant discretion. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase,\nparticularly in the United States, or if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our financial results or operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our operations are subject to regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of customs duties are assessed on the importation of our products. The\nfailure to properly calculate, report and pay such duties when we are subject to them could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial\ncondition. Any change in the laws or regulations regarding such duties, or any interpretation thereof, could result in an increase in the cost of doing business.\nTransfer pricing regulations affect our business and results of operations.\nIn many countries, including the United States, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are\nreported as earned by our United States or local entities and are taxed accordingly. We have adopted transfer pricing agreements with most of our subsidiaries to regulate\ninter-company transfers, which agreements are subject to transfer pricing laws that regulate the flow of funds between the subsidiaries and the parent corporation for product\npurchases, management services, and contractual obligations, such as the payment of member compensation. There can be no assurance that we will be found to be\noperating in compliance with transfer pricing laws, or that those laws would not be modified, which, as a result, may require changes in our operating procedures or\notherwise may have a material adverse effect on our financial results or operations.\nOur products and related activities are subject to extensive government regulation, which could delay, limit or prevent the sale of some of our products in some\nmarkets.\nThe formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, importation, advertising, distribution, sale and storage of certain of our products are subject to extensive\nregulation by various federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the U.S. Department of Agriculture and by various\nagencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, distributed and sold. For example, the FDA requires us and our suppliers to\nmeet relevant current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations for the preparation, packing and storage of foods and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. We are also\nnow required to report serious adverse events associated with consumer use of certain of our products. Other laws and regulations govern or restrict the claims that may be\nmade about our products and the information that must be included and excluded on labels.\nIn markets outside the United States, prior to commencing operations or marketing new products, we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses, or certifications\nfrom a ministry of health or a comparable agency. Moreover, a foreign jurisdiction may pass laws that would prohibit the use of certain ingredients in their particular\nmarket. Compliance with these regulations can create delays and added expense in introducing new products to certain markets.\n21\nTable of Contents\nFailure by our members or us to comply with those regulations could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims and could materially and adversely\naffect our business. If we are not able to satisfy the various regulations, then we would have to cease sales of that product in that market. In addition, the adoption of new\nregulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may adversely affect\nthe marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of revenues.\nWe cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or\nadministrative orders, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. These potential effects could include, however, requirements for the reformulation of certain\nproducts to meet new standards, the recall or discontinuance of certain products, additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements, expanded documentation of the\nproperties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, or additional scientific substantiation. Any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, results of operations or financial condition.\nNew regulations governing the marketing and sale of nutritional supplements could harm our business.\nThere has been an increasing movement in the United States and other markets to increase the regulation of dietary supplements, which could impose additional\nrestrictions or requirements in the future. In the United States, for example, some legislators and industry critics continue to push for increased regulatory authority by the\nFDA over nutritional supplements. Our business could be harmed if more restrictive legislation is successfully introduced and adopted in the future. In particular, the\nadoption of legislation requiring FDA approval of supplements or ingredients could delay or inhibit our ability to introduce new supplements. We face similar pressures in\nour other markets, particularly in China where certain government ministries announced in January 2019 a comprehensive 100-day campaign focusing on companies\ninvolved in the sale of certain products, including nutritional supplements and health products. This campaign, which may not have formally concluded, and may still be\nthe subject of a “look-back review” being conducted by various Chinese governmental agencies, could result in new legislation or regulation. In the United States, the\nFTC's Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (the “Guides”) require disclosure of material connections between an endorser and the\ncompany they are endorsing and require the disclosure of typical results when these are different from those reported by the endorser. The requirements and restrictions of\nthe Guides may diminish the impact of our marketing efforts and negatively impact our sales results. If we or our members fail to comply with these Guides, the FTC could\nbring an enforcement action against us and we could be fined and/or forced to alter our operations. Our operations also could be harmed if new laws or regulations are\nenacted that restrict our ability to market or distribute nutritional supplements or impose additional burdens or requirements on nutritional supplement companies or require\nus to reformulate our products.\nRegulations governing the production and marketing of our personal care products could harm our business.\nOur personal care products are subject to various domestic and foreign laws and regulations that regulate cosmetic products and set forth regulations for determining\nwhether a product can be marketed as a “cosmetic” or requires further approval as an over-the-counter drug. A determination that our cosmetic products impact the\nstructure or function of the human body, or improper marketing claims by our members, may lead to a determination that such products require pre-market approval as a\ndrug. Such regulations in any given market can limit our ability to import products and can delay product launches as we go through the registration and approval process\nfor those products. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we could face enforcement action against us and we could be fined, forced to alter or stop\nselling our products and/or required to adjust our operations. Our operations also could be harmed if new laws or regulations are enacted that restrict our ability to market\nor distribute our personal care products or impose additional burdens or requirements on the contents of our personal care products or require us to reformulate our products.\nIf we are found not to be in compliance with good manufacturing practices our operations could be harmed.\nRegulations on good manufacturing practices and adverse event reporting requirements for the nutritional supplement industry are in effect and require good\nmanufacturing processes for us and our vendors, including stringent vendor qualifications, ingredient identification, manufacturing controls and record keeping. We are\nalso required to report serious adverse events associated with consumer use of our products. Our operations could be harmed if regulatory authorities make determinations\nthat we or our vendors are not in compliance with the regulations. A finding of noncompliance may result in administrative warnings, penalties or actions impacting our\nability to continue selling certain of our products. In addition, compliance with these regulations has increased and may further increase the cost of manufacturing certain of\nour products as we work with our vendors to assure they are qualified and in compliance.\n22\nTable of Contents\nFailure to comply with domestic and foreign laws and regulations governing product claims and advertising could harm our business.\nOur failure to comply with FTC or state regulations, or with regulations in foreign markets that cover our product claims and advertising, including direct claims and\nadvertising by us, as well as claims and advertising by members for which we may be held responsible, may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or\notherwise materially and adversely affect the distribution and sale of our products. Our claims about the level of financial success that can be expected by our members are\nalso subject to FTC review and enforcement. Member activities in our existing markets that violate applicable governmental laws or regulations could result in\ngovernmental or private actions against us in markets where we operate. Given the size of our member force, we cannot ensure that our members will comply with\napplicable legal requirements.\nWe are subject to anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nWe are subject to anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from\nmaking improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business as well as requiring companies and their intermediaries to maintain accurate books and\nrecords. In recent years there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") and the SEC relating to\ncertain countries in which we have business, including China. For example, in 2017, a U.S. based direct selling company announced that it was the target of an investigation\nbeing conducted by the SEC to determine whether certain activities related to the direct selling company's operations in China violated the FCPA. Also, in 2017, another\nU.S. based direct selling company announced that it had initiated a voluntary probe of its operations in China to determine if violations of the FCPA had occurred.\nOur policies mandate compliance with anti-bribery laws by our employees and agents, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal\ncontrols. However, we may be liable for actions of our employees and agents, even if such actions are inconsistent with our policies. Being subject to an investigation by the\nDOJ or the SEC for an alleged violation of the FCPA could cause us to incur significant expenses and distractions that could adversely affect our business. Violations of the\nFCPA, or a similar anti-bribery law, may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe do not have a comprehensive product liability insurance program and product liability claims could hurt our business.\nCurrently, we do not have a comprehensive product liability insurance program, although the insurance carried by our suppliers may cover certain product liability\nclaims against us. As a marketer of dietary supplements, cosmetics and other products that are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies, we may become subjected\nto various product liability claims, including that:\n• our products contain contaminants or unsafe ingredients;\n• our products include inadequate instructions as to their uses; or\n• our products include inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances.\nIf our suppliers’ product liability insurance fails to cover product liability claims or other product liability claims, or any product liability claims exceeds the amount\nof coverage provided by such policies or if we are unsuccessful in any third-party claim against the manufacturer or if we are unsuccessful in collecting any judgment that\nmay be recovered by us against the manufacturer, we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages which could materially harm our business, results of operations\nand financial condition. As a result, we may become required to pay high premiums and accept high deductibles in order to secure adequate insurance coverage in the\nfuture. Especially since we do not have direct product liability insurance, it is possible that product liability claims and the resulting adverse publicity could negatively\naffect our business.\n23\nTable of Contents\nIntellectual Property, Information Technology and Cybersecurity Risks\nWe may be unable to protect or use our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection of\nour confidential information and trademarks. Moreover, the laws of some countries in which we market our products, including China, may not afford effective protection\nof our intellectual property rights. The unauthorized copying, use or other misappropriation of our confidential information, trademarks and other intellectual property\ncould enable third parties to benefit from such property without paying us for it. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial\ncondition. If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, the proceedings could be burdensome, expensive and result in inadequate\nremedies. It is also possible that our use of our intellectual property rights could be found to infringe on prior rights of others and, in that event, we could be compelled to\nstop or modify the infringing use, which could be burdensome and expensive.\nWe rely on and are subject to risks associated with our reliance upon information technology systems.\nOur success is dependent on the accuracy, reliability, and proper use of information processing systems and management information technology. Our information\ntechnology systems are designed and selected to facilitate order entry and customer billing, maintain member records, accurately track purchases and member compensation\npayments, manage accounting operations, generate reports, and provide customer service and technical support. Any interruption in these systems could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that there will not be delays or interruptions in our information technology services. An interruption or delay in availability of these\nservices could, if it lasted long enough, prevent us from accepting orders, cause members to leave our business, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business.\nSystem disruptions or failures, cybersecurity risks, and compromises of data, or the failure to comply with related laws and regulations, could harm our business.\nBecause of our diverse geographic operations and our internationally applicable member compensation plans, our business is highly dependent on the secure and\nefficient functioning of our information technology systems, and the security of personal and sensitive business data. We collect certain personal information, including\npayment data, from members and consumers, as well as our employees. We also develop and maintain sensitive and proprietary business information. Any systems failure\nor interruption, breach in security, or loss of data, whatever the cause, could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nSystems disruptions and data breaches can derive from natural disasters, accidental technological events or human error, but can also result from fraud or malice on\nthe part of external or internal parties. Our systems, networks and software, like those of other companies, have been and are likely to continue to be, the target of\ncybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from isolated or random attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed specifically at us. The risk of a systems\ndisruption or data breach, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions\nfrom around the world have increased. A material systems disruption or data breach affecting us could damage our reputation, deter members from purchasing our products,\nand result in cost and liability to us.\nAlthough we have implemented technical and administrative safeguards to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology systems and data, there\ncan be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective in a continually evolving threat environment. In addition to the risks presented by malicious\nactors and natural disasters, many systems disruptions and data breaches are reportedly caused by human error. Therefore, despite our security policies and mandatory\ntraining, our systems and data are exposed to the risk that human error could either create a vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker, or expose our systems and\ndata to unintended risk of compromise. In addition, as described below, most of our information technology systems and data are hosted by third-party vendors over which\nwe have limited control. We anticipate that we will be required to expend additional resources in order to continue to enhance our technical and administrative safeguards,\nand to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities in our systems, networks and software.\n24\nTable of Contents\nIn any case, a data breach or other significant disruption of our information systems or those related to our third-party vendors, including as a result of cyber-attacks,\ncould (1) disrupt the proper functioning of our systems and networks and therefore operations, (2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft,\nmisappropriation or release of personal, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable data or other information, (3) result in a violation of applicable privacy, cybersecurity,\ndata breach notification requirements under applicable laws, regulations and contractual provisions, subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and exposing us to\npossible fines, lawsuits and related financial liability, (4) require significant management attention and financial resources to investigate and remedy the breach or\ndisruption, and (5) harm our reputation, cause a decrease in the number of our members and revenue, and otherwise damage our business. The occurrence of any of the\nforegoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinally, we are subject to numerous laws, regulations and other obligations that address privacy, data collection and information security in the various markets in\nwhich we conduct business and, despite our compliance efforts, we or our third-party vendors may not comply with all applicable requirements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors\n- Our business is subject to a variety of laws, regulations and other obligations regarding privacy, data protection and information security…”.\nOur systems, software and data reside on third-party servers, exposing us to risks that disruption or intrusion of those servers could temporarily or permanently\ninterrupt our access and damage our business.\nMost of our systems, software and data reside in the “cloud” on servers operated by third-party vendors to which we have limited access. We assess the risks\npresented by these third-party vendors, and our contracts with them contain representations, warranties and other provisions related to the security of our data, and of the\nsystems and software on which we rely. We are, however, limited in our ability to mitigate the risks of a systems disruption or data breach affecting our third-party\nvendors. Moreover, any delay or failure in payment of the third-party vendors, disputes with such vendors, or business interruption or failure of the third-party vendors\ncould result in loss of or interruption in access to our systems, software or data. It is possible that our systems, software and data could in the future be moved to servers of\ndifferent third parties or to our own servers. Any such move could result in temporary or permanent loss of access to our systems, software or data. Any protracted loss of\nsuch access would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCommon Stock Risks\nOur common stock is particularly subject to volatility because of the industry and markets in which we operate.\nThe market prices of securities of direct selling companies have been extremely volatile, particularly those of companies that derive a substantial portion of their\nrevenue from China and/or Hong Kong. These companies have experienced stock market price fluctuations that have often been disproportionate to their operating\nperformance. These broad fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock continues to experience wide fluctuations in trading volumes and prices. This may make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to\nsell shares when they want and at prices they find attractive.\nThe public market for our common stock has historically been very volatile experiencing wide fluctuations in trading volumes and prices. There are a number of\nfactors that may contribute to this volatility, including the following:\n• active participation of speculative traders in our stock (including short sellers);\n• limited trading activity in our common stock;\n• the sale of a large number of shares of our common stock from time to time;\n• market rumors regarding our business operations;\n• government scrutiny of our business;\n• adverse publicity related to our business or industry; and\n• fluctuations in our operating results.\nThis market volatility for our common stock may make it more difficult for holders of our stock to sell shares when they want and at prices they find attractive. There\ncan be no assurance that a larger or more liquid market will be developed or maintained for our common stock.\n25\nTable of Contents\nItem 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nGovernance\nOur Vice President of Strategic Initiatives and Chief Financial Officer oversee our cybersecurity risk management program described in “Risk Management and\nStrategy” below. While the Board of Directors has overall responsibility for risk oversight, it is supported in this regard by the Audit Committee, including with respect to\ncybersecurity matters. The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in monitoring cybersecurity risk by receiving as needed updates from and engaging in\ndiscussions with the Vice President of Strategic Initiatives and the Chief Financial Officer, that cover, among other things, our cybersecurity risk management program,\nresponse readiness and training efforts. The Audit Committee updates the full Board of Directors on cybersecurity matters as appropriate.\nRisk Management and Strategy\nOur business is dependent upon our computer systems, devices and networks to collect, process and store the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of our\nbusiness. We maintain a cybersecurity risk management program, which includes internal and external human resources, processes, controls and technology designed to\nidentify, protect, detect, respond to and manage reasonably foreseeable cybersecurity risks and threats.\nTo safeguard our information systems from cybersecurity threats, we use various security tools that help prevent, identify, escalate, investigate, resolve and recover\nfrom identified vulnerabilities and security incidents in a timely manner at a network and user end point level. These include, but are not limited to, internal reporting,\nmonitoring and detection tools. We engage various third-party vendors to provide these security services, including providing timely cybersecurity threat alerts in addition to\nmonitoring cybersecurity threats and our defenses against cyberattacks. This monitoring includes the proactive identification of vulnerabilities in our systems with threat\nintelligence. In addition, we engage a third-party vendor to perform penetration testing at least annually and our IT team also performs simulations and response readiness\ntests on an annual basis. Our incident response plan sets forth our response protocol to coordinate the activities that we take to respond and recover from cybersecurity\nincidents, which include processes to triage, assess severity, investigate, escalate, contain, and remediate an incident, as well as to comply with potentially applicable legal\nand reporting obligations and mitigate brand and reputational damage.\nWe have adopted an IT Policies and Procedures Policy that requires all employees to acknowledge on an annual basis their responsibilities in abiding with company\npolicies regarding safeguard our network environment. In addition, all employees receive cybersecurity training upon hire with at least annual training on best practices,\nsocial engineering threats and cybersecurity risks.\nWe continuously monitor our computer systems, devices and networks, and work to improve our safeguards against regular and continually evolving cyber and other\nsecurity threats. To date, we are not aware of any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including our\nbusiness strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, notwithstanding the extensive approach we take to cybersecurity, we may not be successful in\npreventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident in the future that could have a material adverse effect on us. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance, the costs related\nto cybersecurity threats or disruptions may not be fully insured. For further information about the cybersecurity risks we face, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – System\ndisruptions or failures, cybersecurity risks, and compromises of data, or the failure to comply with related laws and regulations, could harm our business.”\nItem 2. PROPERTIES\nOur corporate headquarters is located in Hong Kong where we lease 7,300 square feet of office space with a term expiring in June 2026. We also lease 4,900 square\nfeet of corporate office space in Rolling Hills Estates, California with a term expiring in September 2030. To help further develop the market for our products in North\nAmerica, we lease retail space in Rowland Heights, California; Richmond, British Columbia; and Metuchen, New Jersey. Our office space in Hong Kong and Rolling Hills\nEstates is used in support of all of our business segments, while the North America retail space is used in support of our Primary Reporting Segment.\nWe lease seven branch offices throughout China that are used for our China business segment, and additional office space in Peru, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea,\nMalaysia, Thailand, India, and the Cayman Islands (all of which are used for our Primary Reporting Segment). We contract with third parties for fulfillment and distribution\noperations in all of our international markets. We believe that our existing office space is in good condition, and is suitable and adequate for the conduct of our business.\nItem 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nNone.\nItem 4.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “NHTC.” On February 23, 2024, the closing price of our\ncommon stock as reported by Nasdaq was $6.07 per share.\nAt February 23, 2024, there were approximately 110 record holders of our common stock (although we believe that the number of beneficial owners of our common\nstock is substantially greater).\nThe Company expects to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 on each share of common stock outstanding for the foreseeable future. However, any future cash\ndividends will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, and will depend on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other\nfactors considered relevant by the Board of Directors.\nItem 6. [RESERVED]\n27\nTable of Contents\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness Overview\nWe are an international direct-selling and e-commerce company. Subsidiaries controlled by us sell personal care, wellness, and “quality of life” products under the\n“NHT Global” brand. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries have an active physical presence in the following markets: the Americas, which consists of the United States, Canada,\nCayman Islands, Mexico and Peru; Greater China, which consists of Hong Kong, Taiwan and China; Southeast Asia, which consists of Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand;\nSouth Korea; Japan; India; and Europe. We also operate in Russia and Kazakhstan through our engagement with a local service provider. See Note 13 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report for further information about our net sales by geographic area.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were conducting business through 32,410 active members, compared to 38,660 at the end of 2022. We consider a member “active” if\nthey have placed at least one product order with us during the preceding year. Our priority is to focus our resources in our most promising markets, which we consider to be\nGreater China and countries where our existing members have the connections to recruit prospects and sell our products, such as Southeast Asia, India, South America and\nEurope. For further information regarding some of the risks associated with our loss of members, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our recent loss of a significant number of\nmembers is adversely affecting our business…”.\nWe generate approximately 92% of our net sales from subsidiaries located outside the Americas, with sales of our Hong Kong subsidiary representing 79% of net\nsales in the latest fiscal year. Because of the size of our foreign operations, operating results can be impacted negatively or positively by factors such as foreign currency\nfluctuations, inflation rates, and economic, political and business conditions around the world. In addition, our business is subject to various laws and regulations, in\nparticular, regulations related to direct selling activities that create uncertain risks for our business, including improper claims or activities by our members and our potential\ninability to obtain necessary product registrations. We continually evaluate our business for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and this process can and has\nresulted in the identification of certain matters of potential noncompliance, which we work to satisfactorily address. For further information regarding some of the risks\nassociated with the conduct of our business in China and Hong Kong, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and more specifically under the captions “Risk Factors - Because our\nHong Kong operations account for a substantial portion of our overall business...”, “Risk Factors - Our Hong Kong operations are being adversely affected by recent\npolitical and social developments in Hong Kong….”, and “Risk Factors - Our business in China is subject to compliance with a myriad of applicable laws and\nregulations...”.\nChina has been and continues to be our most important business development project. We operate an e-commerce direct selling platform in Hong Kong that generates\nrevenue derived from the sale of products to members in Hong Kong and elsewhere, including China. Substantially all of our Hong Kong revenues are derived from the sale\nof products that are delivered to members in China. Through a separate Chinese entity, we operate an e-commerce retail platform in China. We believe that neither of these\nactivities require a direct selling license in China, which we do not currently hold. We previously submitted a preliminary application for a direct selling license in China,\nbut in 2019 a Chinese governmental authority recommended that we withdraw our application. We expect to reapply for a direct selling license in China when we believe\nthat circumstances are again ripe for doing so. If we are ultimately able to obtain a direct selling license in China, we believe that the incentives inherent in the direct selling\nmodel in China would incrementally benefit our existing business. We do not expect that any increased sales in China derived from obtaining a direct selling license would\ninitially be material and, in any event may be partially offset by the higher fixed costs associated with the establishment and maintenance of required service centers, branch\noffices, manufacturing facilities, certification programs and other legal requirements. We are unable to predict whether and when we will be successful in obtaining a direct\nselling license to operate in China, and if we are successful, when we will be permitted to conduct direct selling operations and whether such operations would be profitable.\n28\nTable of Contents\nIn January 2019 the Chinese government announced a 100-day campaign focused on companies involved in the sale of food, equipment, daily necessities, small\nhome electrical appliances and services that are claimed to promote health. The Chinese government ministries in charge of this campaign indicated that they were targeting\nillegal practices in the industry, particularly the manufacture and sale of counterfeit and substandard products, and false advertising and misleading claims as to the health\nbenefits of products and services. It is understood that the campaign was specifically focused on the business practices of direct selling companies. The campaign and\nassociated negative media coverage resulted in a significant adverse impact on our business, as consumers widely curtailed their purchases within the affected industries.\nWe, like some of our peers, voluntarily decided in January 2019 to temporarily suspend our member activities, such as product roadshows, product trainings and larger\ncompany-sponsored events, in China. We did this because we learned that the 100-day campaign was announced in broad outlines by the central government, and the\ninterpretation and enforcement of the campaign was delegated to the provincial and local governments. We consider it a top priority for our business to develop an\nunderstanding of and cooperate with all levels and jurisdictions of the government agencies, and did not want to run the risk of being inadvertently entangled in government\nenforcement actions as the provincial and local governments formulate and implement their interpretive guidance and rule-making. Although we have been able to relax\nsome restrictions on member activities in certain markets, it may again in the future be necessary or advisable to suspend member activities or take similar actions from time\nto time, and such periods of reduced activity may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough the 100-day campaign was due to expire in April 2019, we are not aware of any information indicating that the campaign has formally concluded. However,\nthe Chinese government subsequently announced that it would conduct a “look-back review” to evaluate the 100-day campaign. As part of this review, we understand that\nvarious Chinese governmental agencies formed a working group to assess the 100-day campaign, particularly focusing on the health market and its supervision in certain\nprovinces. We understand that during September 2019 the working group evaluated the performance and results of a number of organizations and governmental departments\nin these provinces and made recommendations for various improvements. It was noted that each province had opened a number of investigative cases, had successfully\nclosed numerous cases, and had imposed various fines and penalties. We understand that the look-back review continued after September 2019, and we are not aware that\nthis review has been completed. As a result, the business environment in China for health product companies continues to be challenging, which has been exacerbated by\nnegative social media sentiment expressed for these types of companies. We believe that the campaign, as well as its extension and aftermath (including the look-back\nreview), will continue to negatively impact our business in China in the near-term, but will ultimately benefit us and Chinese consumers in the long-term as purveyors of\nsubstandard products are driven from the market.\nIn late 2019 or early 2020 an outbreak of COVID-19 was first identified in China and subsequently spread around the world. On March 11, 2020 the World Health\nOrganization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The outbreak caused the Chinese government to implement powerful measures to control the virus, such\nas requiring businesses to close throughout various areas of China and restricting public gatherings and certain travel within the country. We have significant business in\nChina and in 2023 generated approximately 79% of our revenue in Hong Kong, substantially all of which was derived from the sale of products to members in China. The\nChinese and Hong Kong governments, like the governments of the other countries in which we operate, continue to adjust the restrictive measures that they impose to\ncontrol COVID-19 based on then-current local circumstances; however, it should be noted that the Chinese and Hong Kong governments imposed some of the most\nrestrictive COVID-19 control measures of any country in the world.\nOf particular note, the spread of the Omicron variant in Hong Kong and China, along with the imposition of strong government control measures, significantly\ndisrupted our operations and negatively affected our results of operations in 2022. During the first half of the year, our third-party logistics providers also experienced\nsubstantial difficulties importing and distributing our products in China. However, by early June 2022 the Chinese government began relaxing some of its more stringent\npolicies and we found that the difficulties encountered by our third-party logistics providers were largely resolved by the end of the month. Over the course of the pandemic,\nwe also took steps to adapt some of our marketing programs, such as relying on certain product promotions and webcast training, to overcome the physical restrictions\nimposed in response to the pandemic. Finally, after four consecutive quarters during which we were unable to sponsor any in-person member events in China, Macau or\nHong Kong, we sponsored an in-person event at the end of the third quarter of 2022 in China. Notwithstanding this modestly improved state of affairs, through late 2022 the\nChinese and Hong Kong governments continued to impose strong control measures that were negatively impacting our ability to interact with our members and the ability\nof our members to interact with each other and their customers.\nIn late 2022, the Chinese and Hong Kong governments took comprehensive steps to relax many of their COVID-19 control measures, although the cumulative effect\nof these disruptions materially negatively impacted our financial results from 2020 through 2022. This less restrictive business environment in China and Hong Kong\ncontinued throughout 2023, and we were able to sponsor a number of in-person member events in China during 2023, as well as a large in-person event in Macau during the\nsecond quarter of 2023 and a large in-person event in Hong Kong during the fourth quarter of 2023. We are planning more such events and are hopeful that we will continue\nto normalize operations in China and Hong Kong. Nevertheless, it is still too early to accurately predict the impact on us and our third-party providers of this relaxation of\ncontrol measures and whether it will prove enduring. Ultimately, the severity of the impact on us of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, including\nthe duration and spread of the virus, and the related control measures, which we are unable to accurately predict. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Epidemics, such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war…”.\nRecent political and social developments in Hong Kong, along with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government control measures, are also\nadversely affecting our Hong Kong operations and led us in 2020 to cease sponsoring member meetings and events in Hong Kong. Inasmuch as member meetings and\nevents located in Hong Kong have in the past served as an important component of our product marketing and distribution efforts, we believe that these developments have\nnegatively affected our operations and financial performance. Although we were able to sponsor a large in-person member event in Hong Kong in the fourth quarter of\n2023, it is too early to predict whether these developments will continue to adversely affect our overall business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Item 1A.\nRisk Factors - Our Hong Kong operations are being adversely affected by recent political and social developments in Hong Kong...”.\n29\nTable of Contents\nStatement of Operations Presentation\nWe mainly derive revenue from sales of products. Substantially all of our product sales are to independent members at published wholesale prices. Product sales are\nrecognized when the products are shipped and title passes to independent members, which generally is upon our delivery to the carrier that completes delivery to the\nmembers. We estimate and accrue a reserve for product returns based on our return policies and historical experience. We bill members for shipping charges and recognize\nthe freight revenue in net sales. We have elected to account for shipping and handling activities performed after title has passed to members as a fulfillment cost, and accrue\nfor the costs of shipping and handling if revenue is recognized before the contractually obligated shipping and handling activities occurs. Event and training revenue is\ndeferred and recognized as the event or training occurs.\nCost of sales consists primarily of products purchased from third-party manufacturers, freight cost for transporting products to our foreign subsidiaries and shipping\nproducts to members, import duties, packing materials, product royalties, costs of promotional materials sold to our members at or near cost, and provisions for slow\nmoving or obsolete inventories. Cost of sales also includes purchasing costs, receiving costs, inspection costs and warehousing costs.\nMember commissions are our most significant expense and are classified as an operating expense. Under our compensation plan, members are paid weekly\ncommissions by our subsidiary in which they are enrolled, generally in their home country currency, for product purchases by their down-line member network across all\ngeographic markets. Our China subsidiary maintains an e-commerce retail platform and does not pay commissions, although our Chinese members may participate in our\ncompensation plan through our other subsidiaries. This “seamless” compensation plan enables a member located in one country to enroll other members located in other\ncountries where we are authorized to conduct our business. Currently, there are basically two ways in which our members can earn income:\n• through commissions paid on the accumulated bonus volume from product purchases made by their down-line members and customers; and\n• through retail profits on sales of products purchased by members at wholesale prices and resold at retail prices (for purchasers in some of our smaller markets and\npurchasers from our China subsidiary, sales are for personal consumption only and income may not be earned through retail profits).\nEach of our products is designated a specified number of bonus volume points. Commissions are based on total personal and group bonus volume points per weekly\nsales period. Bonus volume points are essentially a percentage of a product’s wholesale price. As the member’s business expands from successfully enrolling other members\nwho in turn expand their own businesses by selling product to other members, the member receives higher commissions from purchases made by an expanding down-line\nnetwork. In some of our markets, to be eligible to receive commissions, a member may be required to make nominal monthly or other periodic purchases of our products.\nCertain of our subsidiaries do not require these nominal purchases for a member to be eligible to receive commissions. In determining commissions, the number of levels of\ndown-line members included within the member’s commissionable group increases as the number of memberships directly below the member increases.\n30\nTable of Contents\nUnder our current compensation plan, certain of our commission payouts may be limited to a hard cap dollar amount per week or a specific percentage of total\nproduct sales. In some markets, commissions may be further limited. In some markets, we also pay certain bonuses on purchases by up to three generations of personally\nsponsored members, as well as bonuses on commissions earned by up to seven generations of personally sponsored members. Members can also earn additional income,\ntrips and other prizes in specific time-limited promotions and contests we hold from time to time. Member commissions are dependent on the sales mix and, for each of\nfiscal 2023 and 2022 represented 42% of net sales. Occasionally, we make modifications and enhancements to our compensation plan to help motivate members, which can\nhave an impact on member commissions. We may also enter into performance-based agreements for business or market development, which can result in additional\ncompensation to specific members.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of administrative compensation and benefits, travel, credit card fees and assessments, professional fees, certain\noccupancy costs, and other corporate administrative expenses (including stock-based compensation). In addition, this category includes selling, marketing, and promotion\nexpenses (including the costs of member training events and conventions that are designed to increase both product awareness and member recruitment). Because our\nvarious member conventions are not always held at the same time each year, interim period comparisons will be impacted accordingly.\nThe functional currency of our international subsidiaries is generally their local currency. Local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange\non the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the period. Equity accounts are translated at historical\nrates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly into stockholders' equity.\nSales by our foreign subsidiaries are generally transacted in the respective local currencies and are translated into U.S. dollars using average rates of exchange for\neach monthly accounting period to which they relate. Most of our product purchases from third-party manufacturers are transacted in U.S. dollars. Consequently, our sales\nand net earnings are affected by changes in currency exchange rates, with sales and earnings generally increasing with a weakening U.S. dollar and decreasing with a\nstrengthening U.S. dollar.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our operating results as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet sales 100.0% 100.0%\nCost of sales 25.4 25.8\nGross profit 74.6 74.2\nOperating expenses:\nCommissions expense 41.9 42.2\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 36.5 32.6\nTotal operating expenses 78.4 74.8\nLoss from operations (3.8) (0.6)\nOther income, net 5.5 1.8\nIncome before income taxes 1.7 1.2\nIncome tax provision 0.4 0.6\nNet income 1.3% 0.6%\n31\nTable of Contents\nNet Sales\nThe following table sets forth revenue by market for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nAmericas1 $ 3,364 7.7% $ 3,256 6.6%\nHong Kong2 34,898 79.4 38,436 78.2\nChina 1,235 2.8 2,017 4.1\nTaiwan 2,181 5.0 2,493 5.1\nSouth Korea 164 0.4 172 0.4\nJapan 450 1.0 676 1.4\nMalaysia and Singapore 275 0.6 393 0.8\nRussia and Kazakhstan 480 1.1 559 1.1\nEurope 733 1.7 891 1.8\nIndia 144 0.3 241 0.5\nTotal $ 43,924 100.0% $ 49,134 100.0%\n1 United States, Canada, Mexico and Peru.\n2 Substantially all of our Hong Kong revenues are derived from the sale of products that are delivered to members in China. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nNet sales were $43.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared with $49.1 million a year ago, a decrease of $5.2 million, or 11%. Hong Kong net\nsales, substantially all of which were derived from the sale of products shipped to members residing in China, decreased $3.5 million, or 9%, over the prior year. The\ndecrease in Hong Kong net sales was primarily due to the changes in deferred revenue in the two years. Deferred revenue increased $569,000 during 2023, but decreased\n$2.9 million during the prior year as promotional orders from December 2021 were fulfilled and recognized, resulting in a $3.5 million variance. As a result of tepid\nconsumer sentiment in China during 2023, our order volume was down 3% compared with the prior year. The decrease in Hong Kong net sales was also due to the\nrecognition of lower administrative fees in 2023 as compared to the prior year, as increased activity within member electronic wallet (eWallet) accounts resulted in less fees\nassessed during the current year. Outside of our Hong Kong business, net sales decreased $1.7 million, or 16%, over the prior year, with decreased year-over-year net sales\nin each other geographic market except the Americas. The decrease in net sales during 2023 resulted in a loss from operations for the year, as well as negative cash flows\nfrom operations. As of December 31, 2023, deferred revenue was $6.2 million, which primarily consisted of $4.4 million pertaining to unshipped product orders and\nunredeemed product vouchers, as well as $1.8 million in auto ship advances.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was 74.6% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared with 74.2% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the\nimpact of decreased administrative fee revenue referred to above, the gross profit margin percentage in 2023 slightly improved over the prior year primarily due to lower\nlogistics costs.\nCommissions Expense\nCommissions were 41.9% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared with 42.2% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the\nimpact of decreased administrative fee revenue referred to above, commissions as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly in 2023 as compared to the prior year.\n32\nTable of Contents\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $16.0 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Selling, general and administrative\nexpenses as a percentage of net sales increased in the current year as compared to the prior year due to the decrease in net sales in the current year and the relatively inelastic\nnature of these expenses.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income increased to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared with $872,000 in the prior year. The increase in other income is primarily\ndue to greater interest earned on our cash equivalents as compared to the prior year.\nIncome Taxes\nAn income tax provision of $177,000 was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared with $289,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The tax\nprovision for 2022 primarily resulted from the impact of the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) inclusion offset by foreign tax credit attributes generated as a\nresult of GILTI, as well as income tax expense from various foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was lower than in the year\nended December 31, 2022 primarily because our reduced income in foreign operations during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $56.2 million. Total cash and cash equivalents decreased by $13.5 million from December 31, 2022 to\nDecember 31, 2023, primarily due to cash used in operating activities and dividends paid during 2023. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of\nthree months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2023, we had $47.2 million in available-for-sale investments classified as cash\nequivalents. In addition, cash and cash equivalents included $3.7 million held in banks located in China subject to foreign currency controls.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 3.21 to 1.00 and we had $44.2 million of working capital. Working capital as of\nDecember 31, 2023 decreased $12.9 million compared to our working capital as of December 31, 2022.\nCash used in operations was $4.3 million and $4.9 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively. Income tax paid during April 2023 and 2022 for the repatriation tax on\nthe deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income was $3.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Disregarding these payments, cash used in operations\nimproved $2.0 million in 2023 primarily due to an increase in interest earned on our cash equivalents, as well as less employee-related payouts compared to the prior year.\nCash used in investing activities totaled $46,000 and $143,000 during 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n33\nTable of Contents\nCash used in financing activities during 2023 and 2022 consisted solely of quarterly dividend payments of $0.20 per common share, totaling an aggregate of $9.2\nmillion and $9.1 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, on February 5, 2024, the Board of Directors declared another quarterly cash\ndividend of $0.20 on each share of common stock outstanding. The dividend will be payable on March 1, 2024 to stockholders of record on February 20, 2024. We expect to\ncontinue paying a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 on each share of common stock outstanding for the foreseeable future. However, any future cash dividends will be at the\nsole discretion of the Board of Directors, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors considered relevant by the\nBoard of Directors.\nOn January 12, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to our stock repurchase program first approved on July 28, 2015 from $15.0 million to $70.0\nmillion. Any repurchases will be made in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. For all or a portion of\nthe authorized repurchase amount, we may enter into one or more plans that are compliant with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act that are designed to facilitate these\npurchases. The stock repurchase program does not require that we acquire a specific number of shares, and may be suspended from time to time or discontinued. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, $21.9 million of the $70.0 million stock repurchase program remained available for future purchases, inclusive of related estimated income tax.\nWe believe that our existing internal liquidity, supported by cash and cash equivalents, as well as cash flows from operations should be adequate to fund normal\nbusiness operations and address our financial commitments for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not have any significant unused sources of liquid assets. If necessary, we may attempt to generate more funding from the capital markets, but currently do not\nbelieve that will be necessary.\nOur priority is to focus our resources on investing in our most important markets, which we consider to be Greater China and countries where our existing members\nmay have the connections to recruit prospects and sell our products, such as Southeast Asia, India, South America and Europe. We will continue to invest in our Mainland\nChina entity for such purposes as establishing China-based manufacturing capabilities, increasing public awareness of our brand and our products, sourcing more Chinese-\nmade products, building a chain of service stations, opening additional Healthy Lifestyle Centers or branch offices, adding local staffing and other requirements for a\nprospective China direct selling license application.\n34\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require our management to make estimates\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting periods. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of\noperations would be affected. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our\ncircumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time\nthe accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably\ncould have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. There are items within our financial statements that\nrequire estimation but are not deemed critical, as defined above.\nFor a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies and related judgments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.\nItem 7A.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023,\nand the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31,\n2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on\nour audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent\nwith respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for\nthe purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\nWe believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit\ncommittee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex\njudgments.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Operations\nNatural Health Trends Corp., a Delaware corporation (whether or not including its subsidiaries, the “Company”), is an international direct-selling and e-commerce\ncompany. Subsidiaries controlled by the Company sell personal care, wellness, and “quality of life” products under the “NHT Global” brand.\nThe Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries have an active physical presence in the following markets: the Americas, which consists of the United States, Canada,\nCayman Islands, Mexico and Peru; Greater China, which consists of Hong Kong, Taiwan and China; Southeast Asia, which consists of Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand;\nSouth Korea; Japan; India; and Europe. The Company also operates in Russia and Kazakhstan through an engagement with a local service provider.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period.\nThe most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, as\nwell as those used in the determination of liabilities related to sales returns, commissions and income taxes. Various assumptions and other factors prompt the determination\nof these significant estimates. The process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account historical experience and current and expected\neconomic conditions. The actual results may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between the\nestimates and actual results, future results of operations will be affected.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include the Company’s investments in money market funds, government and municipal debt securities, and corporate debt securities. The\nCompany considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Debt securities classified as cash\nequivalents are required to be accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320,\nInvestments - Debt and Equity Securities. As such, the Company determined its investments in debt securities held at December 31, 2023 should be classified as available-\nfor-sale and carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders’ equity. The cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and\ndiscounts to maturity. This amortization is included in other income and expense. Realized gains and losses, as well as interest income, are also included in other income\nand expense. The fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable\ninputs.\nThe Company includes credit card receivables due from certain of its credit card processors in its cash and cash equivalents as the cash proceeds are received within\ntwo to five days.\nThe Company maintains substantially all of its cash balances at several institutions located in the United States, Hong Kong and China which at times may exceed\ninsured limits. As of December 31, 2023, there was $890,000 in bank accounts located in Hong Kong in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash\nequivalents included $3.7 million held in bank accounts located in China subject to foreign currency controls. The Company has not experienced any losses on such\naccounts. See Note 5 for additional information regarding the Company's investments in cash equivalents held in brokerage accounts.\n43\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Cash\nThe Company periodically maintains a cash reserve with certain credit card processing companies to provide for potential uncollectible amounts and chargebacks.\nThose cash reserves held by credit card processing companies located in South Korea are reflected in noncurrent assets since they require the Company to provide 100%\ncollateral before processing transactions, which must be maintained indefinitely.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method. The Company reviews its inventory for obsolescence and any\ninventory identified as obsolete is reserved or written off. The Company’s determination of obsolescence is based on assumptions about the demand for its products, product\nexpiration dates, estimated future sales, and management’s future plans.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets, generally three to five years for office equipment, office software and capitalized internal-use software development costs and five to seven years\nfor furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance\nand repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization expenses are included in the statement of operations as selling, general and administrative\nexpenses. Such expense totaled $164,000 and $204,000 during 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be\nrecoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If\nproperty and equipment are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognizes income taxes under the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the\nfinancial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered\nor settled. Deferred tax expense or benefit is a result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred\ntax assets to the amounts expected to be ultimately realized based on the more likely than not recognition criteria. The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax\npositions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The\nCompany has evaluated its tax positions and determined that there are no significant uncertain tax positions for the current year or years prior. The tax benefits recognized in\nthe financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate\nresolution. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Deferred taxes are not provided for\nstate income tax purposes on the portion of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when these earnings are considered permanently reinvested.\nAmounts Held in eWallets\nThe Company requires commission payments of certain members in Hong Kong and other markets to be first recorded into an electronic wallet (eWallet) account in\nlieu of being paid out directly to members. The eWallet functionality allows members to place new product orders utilizing eWallet available balance and/or request\ncommission payout via multiple payment methods. Amounts held in eWallets are reflected on the balance sheet as a current liability.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of the Company’s international subsidiaries is generally their local currency. Local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of\nexchange on the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the period. Equity accounts are translated at\nhistorical rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly into stockholders' equity.\nAggregate transaction gains or losses, including gains or losses related to foreign-denominated cash and cash equivalents and the re-measurement of certain\nintercompany balances, are included in the statement of operations as other income and expense. Loss on foreign exchange totaling $292,000 and $272,000 was recognized\nduring 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCommissions Expense\nIndependent members earn commissions based on total personal and group bonus volume points per weekly sales period. Each of the Company’s products are\ndesignated a specified number of bonus volume points, which is essentially a percentage of the product’s wholesale price. The Company accrues commissions when earned\nand as the related revenue is recognized and pays commissions on product sales generally two weeks following the end of the weekly sales period.\nIn some markets, the Company also pays certain bonuses on purchases by up to three generations of personally sponsored members, as well as bonuses on\ncommissions earned by up to seven generations of personally sponsored members. Independent members may also earn incentives based on meeting certain qualifications\nduring a designated incentive period, which may range from several weeks to up to a year. The Company estimates and accrues all costs associated with the incentives as\nthe members meet the qualification requirements.\nFrom time to time the Company makes modifications and enhancements to the Company’s compensation plan to help motivate members, which can have an impact\non member commissions. The Company also enters into performance-based agreements for business or market development, which may result in additional compensation\nto specific members.\nNet Income Per Common Share\nDiluted net income per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive\neffect of common stock equivalents. The dilutive effect of non-vested restricted stock is reflected by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock\nmethod, the amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized, if any, is assumed to be used to repurchase shares.\nCertain Risks and Concentrations\nIn contrast to the Company’s business in other parts of the world, the Company’s China subsidiary has not implemented a direct sales model in China. The Chinese\ngovernment permits direct selling only by organizations that have a license and has also adopted anti-pyramid selling and multi-level marketing legislation. The Company\npreviously submitted a preliminary application for a direct selling license in China in August 2015, but in 2019 a Chinese governmental authority recommended that the\nCompany withdraw its application. The Company understands that the governmental authorities recommended that other companies with pending direct selling license\napplications also withdraw their applications. The Company applied to withdraw its application in November 2019, and the governmental authorities approved the\nwithdrawal of its application shortly thereafter. The Company operates an e-commerce direct selling platform in Hong Kong and recognizes the revenue derived from sales\nto both Hong Kong and Chinese members as being generated in Hong Kong. Products purchased by members in China are delivered to third parties that act as the importers\nof record under agreements to pay applicable duties. In addition, through a Chinese entity, the Company sells products in China using an e-commerce retail platform. The\nChinese entity operates separately from the Hong Kong entity, and a Chinese member may elect to participate separately or in both.\nThe Company continually evaluates its business in China and Hong Kong for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including seeking the input of outside\nprofessionals and certain Chinese authorities. This process can and has resulted in the identification of certain matters of potential noncompliance. The Company works on a\ncontinuing basis to satisfactorily address such matters, however there can be no assurance that adequate steps are taken or that applicable laws and regulations are properly\ninterpreted. Should the government authorities determine that the Company’s activities violate applicable laws and regulations, including China’s direct selling, pyramid\nselling or multi-level marketing laws and regulations, or should new laws or regulations be adopted, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the Company attempts to work closely with both national and local Chinese governmental agencies in conducting its business, the Company’s efforts to\ncomply with national and local laws may be harmed by a rapidly evolving regulatory climate, concerns about activities resembling violations of direct selling, pyramid\nselling or multi-level marketing legislation, subjective interpretations of laws and regulations, and activities by individual members that may violate laws notwithstanding\nthe Company's policies prohibiting such activities. Any determination that the Company’s operations or activities, or the activities of its individual members or employee\nsales representatives, or importers of record are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, extended\ninterruptions of business, restrictions on the Company’s future ability to obtain business licenses or expand into new locations, changes to its business model, the\ntermination of required licenses to conduct business, or other actions, any of which could materially harm the Company’s business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\n45\nTable of Contents\nNo single market other than Hong Kong had net sales greater than 10% of total sales. Sales are made to the Company’s members and no single customer accounted\nfor 10% or more of its net sales. However, the Company’s business model can result in a concentration of sales to several different members and their network of members.\nAlthough no single member accounted for 10% or more of net sales, the loss of a key member or that member’s network could have an adverse effect on the Company’s net\nsales and financial results.\nThe Company’s Premium Noni Juice and Triotein™ products each account for at least 10% of the Company’s total revenue as well as the Company's line of probiotic\nproducts comprised of Enhanced Essential Probiotics and Biotic Trio. The Company currently sources each of these products from a single supplier. If demand decreases\nsignificantly, government regulation restricts their sale, the Company is unable to adequately source or deliver the products, or the Company ceases offering the products for\nany reason without suitable replacements, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and accounts payable, approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The\ncarrying amount of the noncurrent restricted cash approximates fair value since, absent the restrictions, the underlying assets would be included in cash and cash\nequivalents.\nAccounting standards permit companies, at their option, to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has\nelected to not fair value existing eligible items.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\n(Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduced an expected credit loss model for the impairment of financial assets measured at\namortized cost basis and added Topic 326 to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, Codification\nImprovements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. The amendments to ASU 2019-11 clarify, correct and make improvements to Topic 326. ASU 2016-13 as\nwell as the updates in ASU 2019-11 were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The adoption of this standard did not have a material\nimpact on the Company's financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which improves reportable\nsegment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 will be applied\nretrospectively and are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early\nadoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of implementing this guidance, but does not expect adoption to have a material impact on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which enhances the transparency and\ndecision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 will be applied on a prospective basis and are effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of implementing this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nOther recently issued accounting pronouncements did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future\nconsolidated financial statements.\n46\nTable of Contents\n2. REVENUE\nRevenue Recognition\nAll revenue is recognized when the performance obligations under a contract, including any product vouchers sold on a stand-alone basis in Hong Kong, are satisfied.\nProduct sales are recognized when the products are shipped and title passes to independent members. Product sales to members are made pursuant to a member agreement\nthat provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon the Company’s delivery to the carrier that completes delivery to the members, which is commonly referred to as\n“F.O.B. Shipping Point.” The Company’s sales arrangements do not contain right of inspection or customer acceptance provisions other than general rights of return. These\ncontracts are generally short-term in nature.\nActual product returns are recorded as a reduction to net sales. The Company estimates and accrues a reserve for product returns based on its return policies and\nhistorical experience. The reserve is based upon the return policy of each country, which varies from 14 days to one year, and their historical return rates, which range from\n1% to 4% of sales. Sales returns were 1% of sales for each of 2023 and 2022. No material changes in estimates have been recognized during the periods presented. See\nNote 4 for additional information.\nThe Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities performed after title has passed to members as a fulfillment cost, and accrues for the costs of\nshipping and handling if revenue is recognized before the contractually obligated shipping and handling activities occurs. Shipping charges billed to members are included\nin net sales. Costs associated with shipments are included in cost of sales. Event and training revenue is deferred and recognized as the event or training occurs. Costs of\nevents and member training are included within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nVarious taxes on the sale of products to members are collected by the Company as an agent and remitted to the respective taxing authority. These taxes are presented\non a net basis and recorded as a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company primarily receives payment by credit card at the time members place orders. Amounts received for unshipped product orders and unredeemed product\nvouchers are considered a contract liability and are recorded as deferred revenue. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $4.4 million and $3.8 million,\nrespectively, of contract liabilities where performance obligations have not yet been satisfied. The increase in contract liabilities from December 31, 2022 to December 31,\n2023 is primarily due to $4.4 million of cash received for unshipped product orders and unredeemed product vouchers during the year ended December 31, 2023 offset\nby $3.8 million of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023 that was included in contract liabilities at December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021,\nthe Company had contract liabilities totaling $6.5 million which was recognized as revenue during 2022. The Company expects to satisfy its remaining performance\nobligations and recognize the revenue within the next twelve months.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe Company sells products to a member network that operates in a seamless manner from market to market, except for the Chinese market where it sells to some\nconsumers through an e-commerce retail platform and the Russia and Kazakhstan market where the Company operates through the engagement of a third-party service\nprovider. See Note 13 for additional information.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nThe Company’s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenues to each\nperformance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged for individual\nproducts to similar customers.\nPractical Expedients\nThe Company generally expenses sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. These costs are recorded in\ncommissions expense.\nThe Company does not provide certain disclosures about unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.\n47\nTable of Contents\n3.

LEASES\nThe Company leases 7,300 square feet of corporate office space in Hong Kong with a term expiring in June 2026, and 4,900 square feet of corporate office space in\nRolling Hills Estates, California with a term expiring in September 2030. To help further develop the market for its products in North America, the Company leases 1,600\nsquare feet of retail space in each of Rowland Heights, California and Richmond, British Columbia, and 2,000 square feet of retail space in Metuchen, New Jersey. The\nRowland Heights, Richmond and Metuchen locations have terms expiring in November 2025, February 2027, and December 2028, respectively.\nThe Company leases seven branch offices throughout China, and additional office space in Peru, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, India, and the\nCayman Islands. The Company contracts with third parties for fulfillment and distribution operations in all of its international markets. None of the Company’s third-party\nlogistics contracts contain a lease, as the Company does not have the right to access the warehouses or move its inventories at will.\nThe components of lease cost were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nOperating leases $ 1,298 $ 1,286\nShort-term leases 150 161\nTotal lease cost $ 1,448 $ 1,447\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating leases liabilities was $1.3 million for each of 2023 and 2022.\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate related to operating leases as of December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 4.2\nWeighted-average discount rate 4.5%\nAs most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate, or the rate of each of its subsidiaries if available,\nbased on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments.\nThe annual scheduled lease payments of the Company's operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\n2024 $ 1,182\n2025 1,039\n2026 580\n2027 299\n2028 304\nThereafter 375\nTotal lease payments $ 3,779\nLess: imputed interest (315)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 3,464\nFor all asset classes, the Company elected not to recognize assets or liabilities at the acquisition date for leases that, at the acquisition date, have a remaining lease\nterm of 12 months or less. Additionally, for all asset classes, the Company choose not to separate nonlease components from lease components and instead account for the\ncombined lease and nonlease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component.\n51\nTable of Contents\n7.

The effect of permanent differences in 2023 and 2022 is mainly due to compensation-related limitations under Internal Revenue Code\nSection 162(m). As of December 31, 2023, the Company does not have a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company analyzed all sources of\navailable income and determined that they are more likely than not to realize the tax benefits of their deferred assets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has a\nvaluation allowance against deferred taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions with an overall net operating loss. The valuation allowance will be reduced at such time as\nmanagement believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Any reductions in the valuation allowance will reduce future income tax\nprovision.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has zero U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards. The Company has post-apportioned U.S. state net operating loss\ncarryforwards of $446,000 that begin expiring in 2038. At December 31, 2023, the Company has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.3 million in\nvarious jurisdictions with various expirations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, income taxes payable for the repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income required the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct (the “Tax Act”), enacted in 2017 by the U.S. government, totaled $9.0 million, of which $5.1 million is reflected as a noncurrent liability.\nAs a result of capital return activities, the Company determined that a portion of its current undistributed foreign earnings is no longer deemed reinvested indefinitely\nby its non-U.S. subsidiaries. For state income tax purposes, the Company will continue to periodically reassess the needs of its foreign subsidiaries and update its indefinite\nreinvestment assertion as necessary. To the extent that additional foreign earnings are not deemed permanently reinvested, the Company expects to recognize additional\nincome tax provision at the applicable state corporate income tax rate(s). As of December 31, 2023, the Company has not recorded a state deferred tax liability for earnings\nthat the Company plans to repatriate out of accumulated earnings in future periods because all earnings as of December 31, 2023 have already been repatriated. Due to the\nTax Act, repatriation from foreign subsidiaries will be offset with a dividends received deduction, resulting in little to no impact on federal tax expense. All undistributed\nearnings in excess of 50% of current earnings on an annual basis are intended to be reinvested indefinitely as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the United States, California, New Jersey, Texas and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer\nsubject to state income tax examinations for years prior to 2018. The Company is not aware of any jurisdictions that are currently examining any income tax returns of the\nCompany.\n53\nTable of Contents\n8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe Company has employment agreements with certain members of its management team that can be terminated by either the employee or the Company upon four\nweeks’ notice. The employment agreements entered into with the management team contain provisions that guarantee the payments of specified amounts in the event of a\nchange in control, as defined, or if the employee is terminated without cause, as defined, or terminates employment for good reason, as defined.\n9. STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS\nRestricted Stock\nAt the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders held on April 7, 2016, the Company’s stockholders approved the Natural Health Trends Corp. 2016 Equity\nIncentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”) to replace its 2007 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2016 Plan allows for the grant of various equity awards including incentive stock options,\nnon-statutory options, stock, stock units, stock appreciation rights and other similar equity-based awards to the Company’s employees, officers, non-employee directors,\ncontractors, consultants and advisors of the Company. Up to 2,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (subject to adjustment under certain circumstances) may be\nissued pursuant to awards granted. At December 31, 2023, 1,125,349 shares remained available for issuance under the 2016 Plan.\nOn February 6, 2023, the Company granted 97,900 shares of restricted common stock to certain of its employees. The shares vest in equal parts on a quarterly basis\nover the next three years and are subject to forfeiture in the event of an employee's termination of service to the Company under specified circumstances.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s restricted stock activity under the 2016 Plan:\nWtd. Avg. Price at\nShares Date of Issuance\nNonvested at December 31, 2021 186,245 $ 7.08\nVested (186,245) $ 7.08\nNonvested at December 31, 2022 — $ —\nGranted 97,900 $ 4.84\nVested (31,914) $ 4.84\nForfeited (3,666) $ 4.84\nNonvested at December 31, 2023 62,320 $ 4.84\nShare-based compensation expense of $161,000 was recognized during 2023. As of December 31, 2023, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense\nrelated to non-vested restricted stock was $295,000, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.1 years.\nPhantom Equity\nOn March 15, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved and adopted a Phantom Equity Plan (the “Phantom Plan”). Under the terms of the Phantom Plan,\nthe Board of Directors' Compensation Committee may grant to the Company’s employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, or advisors awards of phantom\nshares entitling grantees the right to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of an equal number of shares of the Company’s common stock upon the close of a\nvesting period, subject to any maximum payment value that the Compensation Committee may set. The vesting of phantom shares is subject to such vesting conditions as\nthe Compensation Committee may specify in a grantee’s award agreement. Grantees of phantom shares shall not by virtue of their receipt of phantom shares have any\nownership rights in shares of the Company’s common stock. The Phantom Plan shall continue for a period of ten years, after which no further phantom shares may be\nawarded (although any phantom shares awarded prior to the expiration of such 10-year period shall be unaffected by the termination of the Phantom Plan).\nAlso on March 15, 2021, awards for 223,307 phantom shares were granted to the Company’s employees and its non-employee directors. The phantom shares vested\nin eight equal three-month vesting increments, subject to the satisfaction of both a time-based vesting condition and a performance vesting condition. Both of these vesting\nconditions were deemed satisfied on the grant date for the initial vesting increment, and were satisfied for each of the following three vesting periods in 2021 and the first\nvesting period in 2022. The time-based vesting condition was also satisfied for the final three vesting periods in 2022. In order for the time-based vesting condition to be\nsatisfied for each vesting period, the grantee must have remained continuously employed by, or be otherwise continuously providing services to, the Company through the\nend of the vesting period, and in order for the performance vesting condition to be satisfied for each performance period, the performance criteria designated by the\nCompensation Committee must have been satisfied. The initial performance vesting condition to be applied to measure performance for the period between March 15,\n2021 and June 15, 2021 was designated by the Compensation Committee on or before April 14, 2021, and applied to all future performance periods unless the\nCompensation Committee elected to change the performance vesting condition on a prospective basis. Future changes to the performance vesting condition must have\nbeen made on or before the fifteenth day of any future performance period. If either vesting condition was not satisfied for a vesting date, then the phantom shares scheduled\nto vest on such date would be forfeited. These phantom shares were subject to a maximum payment value of $12.00 per phantom share. An additional award with similar\nvesting conditions for 9,074 phantom shares was granted on May 14, 2021 to the Company's new non-employee director, while unvested 9,074 phantom shares granted to\nthe Company's departing non-employee director were forfeited on or about the same date. On each of May 23, 2022, August 31, 2022, and November 25, 2022 the\nCompensation Committee determined to amend the outstanding awards to provide that the performance criteria shall be deemed satisfied for the three-month performance\nperiods relating to the June 15, 2022, September 15, 2022 and December 15, 2022 vesting dates, respectively. In making its determination, the Compensation Committee\nnoted that the fact that the performance criteria were not achieved for the relevant performance periods was due to extraordinary business circumstances in China that were\nclearly beyond the Company’s control. Of the phantom shares awarded in 2021, 223,307 phantom shares vested, no shares remain unvested, and 9,074 shares were forfeited\nas of the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOn February 7, 2023, the Company granted 212,937 phantom shares to certain of the Company’s employees and its non-employee directors. The phantom shares\nvest in eight equal three-month vesting increments, subject to the satisfaction of both a time-based vesting condition and a performance vesting condition. Both of these\nvesting conditions were deemed satisfied on the grant date for the initial vesting increment. In order for the time-based vesting condition to be satisfied for each vesting\nperiod, the grantee must remain continuously employed by, or be otherwise continuously providing services to, the Company through the end of the vesting period, and in\norder for the performance vesting condition to be satisfied for each performance period, the performance criteria designated by the Compensation Committee must be\nsatisfied. The initial performance vesting condition will be designated by the Compensation Committee and will apply to all future performance periods, unless the\nCompensation Committee elects to change the performance vesting condition on a prospective basis. Future changes to the performance vesting condition must be made on\nor before the fifteenth day of any future performance period. If either vesting condition is not satisfied for a vesting date, then the phantom shares scheduled to vest on such\ndate will be forfeited. These phantom shares are subject to a maximum payment value of $12.00 per phantom share. Of the phantom shares awarded in 2023,\n106,468 phantom shares vested and 106,469 remain unvested as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe phantom share awards are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation since they require cash\nsettlement. The grant date of each vesting increment will be established when the Company and the grantees reach a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions\nof an award, which is the date upon which each performance vesting condition is communicated to the grantees. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite\nservice period if it is probable that the performance vesting condition will be achieved. The fair value of the liability incurred is remeasured at the end of each reporting\nperiod with any changes in fair value recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period.\nAs a result of phantom shares, the Company recognized compensation expense related to the cash settlement of such shares of $551,000 and $575,000 during each of\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\n54\nTable of Contents\n10.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company is a party to a Royalty Agreement and License with Broady Health Sciences, L.L.C., a Texas limited liability company, (“BHS”) regarding the\nmanufacture and sale of a product called ReStor™. George K. Broady, a former director of the Company and beneficial owner of more than 5% of its outstanding common\nstock, is an indirect owner of BHS. Brunde E. Broady, also a former director of the Company and daughter of Mr. Broady, is the President and Chief Executive Officer of\nBHS. Under this agreement (as amended), the Company agreed to pay BHS a royalty based on a price per unit in return for the right to manufacture (or have manufactured),\nmarket, import, export and sell this product worldwide by or through multi-level marketing or network marketing. The Company recognized royalties of $46,000 and\n$51,000 during 2023 and 2022, respectively, under this agreement. The Company is not required to purchase any product under the agreement, and the agreement may be\nterminated under certain circumstances with no notice.

SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company sells products to a member network that operates in a seamless manner from market to market, except for the China market where it sells to some\nconsumers through an e-commerce retail platform, and the Russia and Kazakhstan market where the Company’s engagement of a third-party service provider results in a\ndifferent economic structure than its other markets. Otherwise, the Company believes that all of its other operating segments have similar economic characteristics and are\nsimilar in the nature of the products sold, the product acquisition process, the types of customers products are sold to, the methods used to distribute the products, and the\nnature of the regulatory environment. Therefore, the Company aggregates its other operating segments (including its Hong Kong operating segment) into a single reporting\nsegment (the “Primary Reporting Segment”).\nThe Company reviews its net sales and operating income (loss) by operating segment, and reviews its assets and capital expenditures on a consolidated basis and not\nby operating segment. As such, net sales and operating income (loss) are presented by reportable segment and assets and capital expenditures by operating segment are not\npresented. Segment operating income is adjusted for certain direct costs and commission allocation.\n56\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s operating information by geographic area are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet sales:\nPrimary Reporting Segment $ 42,209 $ 46,558\nChina 1,235 2,017\nRussia and Kazakhstan 480 559\nTotal net sales $ 43,924 $ 49,134\nIncome (loss) from operations:\nPrimary Reporting Segment $ 7,067 $ 7,783\nChina (534) 139\nRussia and Kazakhstan (134) (166)\nIncome from operations for reportable segments, net 6,399 7,756\nUnallocated corporate expenses (8,070) (8,026)\nOther income, net 2,416 872\nIncome before income taxes $ 745 $ 602\nThe Company’s net sales by geographic area are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet sales from external customers:\nUnited States $ 1,157 $ 1,175\nCanada 710 664\nPeru 1,497 1,417\nHong Kong1 34,898 38,436\nChina 1,235 2,017\nTaiwan 2,181 2,493\nJapan 450 676\nRussia and Kazakhstan 480 559\nEurope 733 891\nOther foreign countries 583 806\nTotal net sales $ 43,924 $ 49,134\n1 Substantially all of the Company's Hong Kong revenues are derived from the sale of products that are delivered to members in China.

Based on this evaluation and\nas disclosed in “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting” below, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded\nthat our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process\ndesigned by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to\nfuture periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\nManagement evaluates the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting by using the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework\n(2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this criteria, management concluded that our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 was effective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

Introduction\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Natural Health Trends Corp., a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware (the “Company”), has adopted this policy\n(this “Policy”), which provides for the recovery of erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation (as defined below) from current and former executive officers in the\nevent of an Accounting Restatement (as defined below) resulting from the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under United States\nfederal securities laws. This policy is intended to comply with Section 10D and Rule 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)\n(“Rule 10D-1”), and Section 5608 of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Rules (the “Nasdaq Rule”). Definitions of capitalized terms used in this Policy are included in Section\n11 below.\n2. Administration\nThe Compensation Committee will have full authority to administer this Policy. The Compensation Committee will, subject to the provisions of this Policy, applicable\nlaw and regulation, and the Nasdaq Rule, make such determinations and interpretations and take such actions in connection with this Policy as it deems necessary,\nappropriate or advisable. All determinations and interpretations made by the Compensation Committee will be final, binding and conclusive.\n3. Recovery\nIn the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall seek to recover, reasonably promptly, all Erroneously Awarded Compensation from an Executive Officer\nduring the Time Period Covered in accordance with the Nasdaq Rule and Rule 10D-1. Such determination of the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation, in the case\nof an Accounting Restatement, will be made without regard to any individual knowledge or responsibility related to the Accounting Restatement or the Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company is required to undertake an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall recover the Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation unless the recovery is Impracticable (as defined below).\nThe Company shall seek to recover all Erroneously Awarded Compensation that was awarded or paid in accordance with the definition of “Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation” set forth below in Section 11. If such Erroneously Awarded Compensation was not awarded or paid on a formulaic basis, the Company shall seek to recover\nthe amount that the Compensation Committee determines in good faith should be recouped.\n4. Other Actions\nThe Compensation Committee may, subject to applicable law, seek recovery in the manner it chooses, including by seeking reimbursement from the Executive Officer\nof all or part of the compensation awarded or paid, by electing to withhold unpaid compensation, by set-off, or by rescinding or canceling unvested stock.\nTo the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company for any Erroneously Awarded Compensation received under any duplicative recovery\nobligations established by the Company or applicable law, it shall be appropriate for any such reimbursed amount to be credited to the amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy.\nTo the extent that an Executive Officer fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company when due, the Company shall take all actions reasonable\nand appropriate to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable Executive Officer. The applicable Executive Officer shall be required to reimburse\nthe Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance\nwith the immediately preceding sentence.\nIn the reasonable exercise of its business judgment under this Policy, the Compensation Committee may in its sole discretion determine whether and to what extent\nadditional action is appropriate to address the circumstances surrounding an Accounting Restatement to minimize the likelihood of any recurrence and to impose such other\ndiscipline as it deems appropriate.\n5. No Indemnification or Reimbursement\nNotwithstanding the terms of any other policy, program, agreement or arrangement, in no event will the Company or any of its affiliates indemnify or reimburse an\nExecutive Officer for any loss of Erroneously Awarded Compensation, or any claims relating to the Company’s enforcement of its rights under this Policy and in no event\nwill the Company or any of its affiliates pay premiums on any insurance policy that would cover an Executive Officer’s potential obligations with respect to Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation under this Policy.\n6. Other Claims and Rights\nThe remedies under this Policy are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any legal and equitable claims the Company or any of its affiliates may have or any actions that\nmay be imposed by law enforcement agencies, regulators, administrative bodies, or other authorities. Further, the exercise by the Compensation Committee of any rights\npursuant to this Policy will not impact any other rights that the Company or any of its affiliates may have with respect to any Covered Person subject to this Policy.\n7. Acknowledgement by Executive Officers; Condition to Eligibility for Incentive Compensation\nThe Company will provide notice and seek acknowledgement of this Policy from each Executive Officer (see Exhibit A attached hereto), provided that the failure to\nprovide such notice or obtain such acknowledgement will have no impact on the applicability or enforceability of this Policy. After the Effective Date, the Company must be\nin receipt of an Executive Officer’s acknowledgement as a condition to such Executive Officer’s eligibility to receive Incentive-based Compensation.\n8. Amendment\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion or as it deems necessary. No amendment to this Policy shall be effective if such amendment would\n(after taking into account any actions taken by the Company contemporaneously with such amendment) cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule\nor Nasdaq Rule.\n9. Effectiveness\nExcept as otherwise determined in writing by the Compensation Committee, this Policy will apply to any Incentive-based Compensation that is Received by an\nExecutive Officer on or after the Effective Date. This Policy will survive and continue notwithstanding any termination of an Executive Officer’s employment with the\nCompany and its affiliates.\n10. Successors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and their successors, beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal\nrepresentatives.\n11. Definitions of Terms\n“Accounting Restatement” means a restatement of any of the Company’s financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act,\nor the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. securities laws, regardless of\nwhether the Company or Executive Officer misconduct was the cause for such accounting restatement. “Accounting Restatement” includes any accounting restatement the\nCompany is required to prepare to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result\nin a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period.\n“Compensation Committee” means the Company’s committee responsible for executive compensation decisions, or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of the\nindependent directors serving on the Board.\n“Effective Date” means October 2, 2023 (the effective date of the Nasdaq Rule).\n“Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of any Incentive-based Compensation (calculated on a pre-tax basis) Received by an Executive Officer during\nthe Time Period Covered that is in excess of the amount that otherwise would have been Received if the calculation were based on the Accounting Restatement. For the\navoidance of doubt, Erroneously Awarded Compensation does not include any Incentive-based Compensation Received by a person (i) before such person began service in\na position or capacity meeting the definition of an “Executive Officer,” (ii) who did not serve as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period relating to\nany Incentive-based Compensation, or (iii) during any period the Company did not have a class of its securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national\nsecurities association. For Incentive-based Compensation based on (or derived from) stock price or total shareholder return where the amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable Accounting Restatement, the amount will be determined by the\nCompensation Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the\nIncentive-based Compensation was Received (in which case, the Company will maintain documentation of such determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such\ndocumentation to the Company’s applicable listing exchange).\n“Executive Officer” means the Company’s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any\nvice-president of the issuer in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-\nmaking function, or any other person who performs similar policymaking functions for the issuer. Executive officers of an issuer’s parent(s) or subsidiaries are deemed\nexecutive officers of the issuer if they perform such policy making functions for the issuer. The identification of an executive officer for purposes of this Policy shall include\neach executive officer who is or was identified pursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K.\n“Financial Reporting Measure” means a measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial\nstatements (including “non-GAAP” financial measures, such as those appearing in the Company’s earnings releases or Management Discussion and Analysis), and any\nmeasure that is derived wholly or in part from such measure. Stock price and total shareholder return (and any measures derived wholly or in part therefrom) shall, for\npurposes of this Policy, be considered Financial Reporting Measures. For the avoidance of doubt, a Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented in the Company’s\nfinancial statements or included in a filing with the SEC.\n“Impracticable.” Any of the following three conditions is met and the Compensation Committee has determined that recovery would be impracticable:\n(i) The Compensation Committee has determined that the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be\nrecovered after the Company has (A) made a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation and (B) documented such attempt(s) and\nprovided documentation of such attempt(s) to recover to the Company’s applicable listing exchange;\n(ii) Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to\nrecover any amount of erroneously awarded compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company must obtain an opinion of home country counsel,\nacceptable to the Company’s applicable listing exchange, that recovery would result in such a violation, and must provide such opinion to the Company’s\napplicable listing exchange; or\n(iii) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to\nmeet the qualifications and other applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder.\n“Incentive-based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\n“Received.” Incentive-based Compensation is deemed “Received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-\nbased Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\n“Time Period Covered” means, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three completed fiscal years of the Company immediately preceding the earlier of (i) the\ndate the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes (or reasonably\nshould have concluded) that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement or (ii) the date a regulator, court or other legally authorized entity directs the\nCompany to undertake an Accounting Restatement. The “Time Period Covered” also includes any transition period of less than nine months (that results from a change in\nthe Company’s fiscal year) within or immediately following the three completed fiscal years identified in the preceding sentence.\nExhibit A\nATTESTATION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF POLICY FOR THE RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY AWARDED COMPENSATION\nBy my signature below, I acknowledge and agree that:\n● I have received and read the attached Compensation Recovery Policy (this “Policy”).\n● I hereby agree to abide by all of the terms of this Policy both during and after my employment with the Company, including, without limitation, by promptly\nrepaying or returning any Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company as determined in accordance with this Policy.\nSignature:\nPrinted Name:\nDate:"

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). When used in this report, the words or phrases “will likely result,” “expect,” “intend,” “will continue,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “believe” and similar expressions are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Exchange Act. These statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning, among other things, future revenue, earnings, growth strategies, new products and initiatives, future operations and operating results, and future business and market opportunities.\n\nForward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the date hereof, and forward-looking statements in documents incorporated by reference speak only as of the date of those documents. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. We caution and advise readers that these statements are based on certain assumptions that may not be realized and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and beliefs contained herein.\n\nFor a summary of certain risks related to our business, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes the following:\n\n• |  Because our Hong Kong operations account for a substantial portion of our overall business, and substantially all of our Hong Kong business is derived from the sale of products to members in China, any material adverse change in our business relating to either Hong Kong or China would likely have a material adverse impact on our overall business;  \n---|---  \n• |  Our Hong Kong operations are being adversely affected by recent political and social developments in Hong Kong, and the negative impact on our operations and financial performance could continue or intensify;  \n---|---  \n• | We experienced negative operating cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and only modest positive operating cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Unless our operating cash flows improve, this negative financial performance could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price;  \n---|---  \n• | Adverse publicity associated with our products, ingredients or network marketing program, or those of similar companies, could harm our financial condition and operating results;  \n• | Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment;  \n• | We are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of revenue diversification;  \n• | Epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility may seriously harm our business;  \n• | The high level of competition in our industry could adversely affect our business;  \n---|---  \n• | Failure of new products to gain member and market acceptance could harm our business;  \n---|---  \n• |  We rely on a limited number of independent third parties to manufacture and supply our products on a timely basis;  \n---|---  \n• | Growth may be impeded by the political and economic risks of entering and operating in foreign markets;  \n---|---  \n• | Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively impact our business and the market price of our common stock;  \n---|---  \n• | We could be adversely affected by management changes or an inability to attract and retain key management, directors and consultants;  \n• | Our recent loss of a significant number of members is adversely affecting our business, and if we cannot stabilize or increase the number of members our business could be further negatively impacted;  \n• | Although virtually all of our members are independent contractors, improper member actions that violate laws or regulations could harm our business;  \n• | An increase in the amount of compensation paid to members would reduce profitability;  \n• | We may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our members and service providers, which could harm our financial condition and operating results;  \n• | Our business in China is subject to compliance with a myriad of applicable laws and regulations, and any actual or alleged violations of those laws or government actions otherwise directed at us could have a material adverse impact on our business and the value of our company;  \n---|---  \n• | Changes in government trade and economic policies, including the imposition or threatened imposition of tariffs and other restrictive trade policies, and ongoing political and economic disputes between the United States and other jurisdictions, particularly China, may have a negative effect on global economic conditions and our business, financial results and financial condition;  \n• |  Direct-selling laws and regulations may prohibit or severely restrict our direct sales efforts and cause our revenue and profitability to decline, and regulators could adopt new regulations that harm our business;  \n• | Our business is subject to a variety of laws, regulations and other obligations regarding privacy, data protection and information security. Any actual or perceived failure by us or our third-party vendors to comply with such laws, regulations or other obligations could materially adversely affect our business;  \n---|---  \n• |  Challenges by third parties to the legality of our business operations could harm our business;  \n• | We have in the past been involved in, and may in the future face, lawsuits, claims, and governmental proceedings and inquiries that could harm our business;  \n---|---  \n• |  Currency exchange rate fluctuations could lower our revenue and net income;  \n---|---  \n• |  Changes in tax or duty laws, and unanticipated tax or duty liabilities, could adversely affect our net income;  \n---|---  \n• |  Transfer pricing regulations affect our business and results of operations;  \n---|---  \n• |  Our products and related activities are subject to extensive government regulation, which could delay, limit or prevent the sale of some of our products in some markets;  \n---|---  \n• | New regulations governing the marketing and sale of nutritional supplements could harm our business;  \n---|---  \n• | Regulations governing the production and marketing of our personal care products could harm our business;  \n---|---  \n• | If we are found not to be in compliance with good manufacturing practices our operations could be harmed;  \n---|---  \n• | Failure to comply with domestic and foreign laws and regulations governing product claims and advertising could harm our business;  \n---|---  \n• | We are subject to anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;  \n---|---  \n• | We do not have a comprehensive product liability insurance program and product liability claims could hurt our business;  \n---|---  \n  \n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n• | We may be unable to protect or use our intellectual property rights;  \n---|---  \n• | We rely on and are subject to risks associated with our reliance upon information technology systems;  \n---|---  \n• | System disruptions or failures, cybersecurity risks, and compromises of data, or the failure to comply with related laws and regulations, could harm our business;  \n---|---  \n• | Our systems, software and data reside on third-party servers, exposing us to risks that disruption or intrusion of those servers could temporarily or permanently interrupt our access and damage our business;  \n---|---  \n• | Our common stock is particularly subject to volatility because of the industry and markets in which we operate; and  \n---|---  \n• | Our common stock continues to experience wide fluctuations in trading volumes and prices. This may make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to sell shares when they want and at prices they find attractive.  \n---|---  \n  \nAdditional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are set forth in this report, including under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in our financial statements and the related notes.\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**[](# \"part1\")PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\n**[](# \"item1\")Item 1.

(UNAUDITED)**\n\n**_1._ NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n_Nature of Operations_\n\nNatural Health Trends Corp., a Delaware corporation (whether or _not_ including its subsidiaries, the “Company”), is an international direct-selling and e-commerce company. Subsidiaries controlled by the Company sell personal care, wellness, and “quality of life” products under the “NHT Global” brand.\n\nThe Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries have an active physical presence in the following markets: the Americas, which consists of the United States, Canada, Cayman Islands, Mexico and Peru; Greater China, which consists of Hong Kong, Taiwan and China; Southeast Asia, which consists of Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand; South Korea; Japan; India; and Europe. The Company also operates in Russia and Kazakhstan through an engagement with a local service provider.\n\n_Basis of Presentation_\n\nThe unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form _10_ -Q and Rule _10_ -_01_ of Regulation S-_X._ As a result, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s financial information for the interim periods presented. The results of operations of any interim period are _not_ necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the fiscal year. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s _2023_ Annual Report on Form _10_ -K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on _February 28, 2024._\n\n_Principles of Consolidation_\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n_Cash and Cash Equivalents_\n\nThe Company maintains substantially all of its cash balances at several institutions located in the United States, Hong Kong and China which at times _may_ exceed insured limits. As of _September 30, 2024_ , there was $29,000 and $509,000 in bank accounts located in the United States and Hong Kong, respectively, in excess of insured limits. As of _September 30, 2024_ , cash and cash equivalents included $3.8 million held in bank accounts located in China subject to foreign currency controls. The Company has _not_ experienced any losses on such accounts. See Note _4_ for additional information regarding the Company's investments in cash equivalents held in brokerage accounts.\n\n_Net Income Per Common Share_\n\nDiluted net income per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents. The dilutive effect of non-vested restricted stock is reflected by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has _not_ yet recognized, if any, is assumed to be used to repurchase shares.\n\nThe following table illustrates the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share data):\n\n______Three Months Ended September 30,______  \n---  \n___2024___ |  ___2023___  \n_Income (Numerator)_|  _Shares (Denominator)_ | _Per Share Amount_|  _Income (Numerator)_|  _Shares (Denominator)_ | _Per Share Amount_  \nBasic net income per common share:  \nNet income available to common stockholders | $| 35| 11,471| $| 0.00| $| 172| 11,440| $| 0.02  \nEffect of dilutive securities:  \nNon-vested restricted stock | —| 19| —| 14  \nDiluted net income per common share:  \nNet income available to common stockholders plus assumed dilution | $| 35| 11,490| $| 0.00| $| 172| 11,454| $| 0.02  \n______Nine Months Ended September 30,______  \n---  \n___2024___ |  ___2023___  \n_Income (Numerator)_|  _Shares (Denominator)_ | _Per Share Amount_|  _Income (Numerator)_|  _Shares (Denominator)_ | _Per Share Amount_  \nBasic net income per common share:  \nNet income available to common stockholders | $| 396| 11,464| $| 0.03| $| 210| 11,432| $| 0.02  \nEffect of dilutive securities:  \nNon-vested restricted stock | —| 24| —| 17  \nDiluted net income per common share:  \nNet income available to common stockholders plus assumed dilution | $| 396| 11,488| $| 0.03| $| 210| 11,449| $| 0.02  \n  \n_6_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn  _November 2023,_ the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU  _2023_ -_07,_  _Segment Reporting (Topic _280_): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures_, which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in ASU  _2023_ -_07_ will be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years beginning after  _December 15, 2023,_ and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after  _December 15, 2024,_ with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of implementing this guidance.\n\nIn  _December 2023,_ the FASB issued ASU  _2023_ -_09,_  _Income Taxes (Topic _740_): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures_, which enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU  _2023_ -_09_ will be applied on a prospective basis and are effective for annual periods beginning after  _December 15, 2024,_ with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of implementing this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nOther recently issued accounting pronouncements did _not_ or are _not_ believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial statements.\n\n**_2._ REVENUE**\n\n_Revenue Recognition_\n\nAll revenue is recognized when the performance obligations under a contract, including any product vouchers sold on a stand-alone basis in Hong Kong, are satisfied. Product sales are recognized when the products are shipped and title passes to independent members. Product sales to members are made pursuant to a member agreement that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon the Company’s delivery to the carrier that completes delivery to the members, which is commonly referred to as “F.O.B. Shipping Point.” The Company’s sales arrangements do _not_ contain right of inspection or customer acceptance provisions other than general rights of return. These contracts are generally short-term in nature.\n\nActual product returns are recorded as a reduction to net sales. The Company estimates and accrues a reserve for product returns based on its return policies and historical experience. The reserve is based upon the return policy of each country, which varies from 14 days to one year, and their historical return rates, which range from 1% to 7% of sales. Sales returns were 1% of sales for each of the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_. _No_ material changes in estimates have been recognized during the periods presented. See Note _3_ for additional information.\n\nThe Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities performed after title has passed to members as a fulfillment cost, and accrues for the costs of shipping and handling if revenue is recognized before the contractually obligated shipping and handling activities occurs. Shipping charges billed to members are included in net sales. Costs associated with shipments are included in cost of sales. Event and training revenue is deferred and recognized as the event or training occurs. Costs of events and member training are included within selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\nVarious taxes on the sale of products to members are collected by the Company as an agent and remitted to the respective taxing authority. These taxes are presented on a net basis and recorded as a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority.\n\n_Deferred Revenue_\n\nThe Company primarily receives payment by credit card at the time members place orders. Amounts received for unshipped product orders and unredeemed product vouchers are considered a contract liability and are recorded as deferred revenue. As of _September 30, 2024_ and _December 31, 2023_ , the Company had $5.2 million and $4.4 million, respectively, of contract liabilities where performance obligations have _not_ yet been satisfied. The increase in contract liabilities from  _December 31, 2023_ to  _September 30, 2024_ is primarily due to $5.2 million of cash received for unshipped product orders and unredeemed product vouchers during the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ offset by $4.4 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in contract liabilities at  _December 31, 2023_. As of  _December 31, 2022_ , the Company had contract liabilities totaling $3.8 million of which $3.8 million was recognized as revenue during the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2023_. The Company expects to satisfy its remaining performance obligations and recognize the revenue within the next _twelve_ months.\n\n_Disaggregation of Revenue_\n\nThe Company sells products to a member network that operates in a seamless manner from market to market, except for the Chinese market where it sells to consumers through an e-commerce retail platform and the Russia and Kazakhstan market where the Company operates through an engagement of a _third_ -party service provider. See Note _11_ for revenue by market information.\n\n_7_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nThe Company’s net sales by product and service are as follows (in thousands):\n\n__Three Months Ended September 30,__ |  __Nine Months Ended September 30,__  \n---|---  \n_2024_ |  _2023_ |  _2024_ |  _2023_  \nProduct sales | $| 10,412| $| 10,303| $| 31,261| $| 31,505  \nAdministrative fees, freight and other | 373| 373| 1,092| 1,628  \nLess: sales returns | (94| )| (61| )| (236| )| (146| )  \nTotal net sales | $| 10,691| $| 10,615| $| 32,117| $| 32,987  \n  \n_Concentration_\n\nNo single market other than Hong Kong had net sales greater than _10%_ of total net sales. Sales are made to the Company’s members and no single customer accounted for _10%_ or more of net sales for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_. However, the Company’s business model can result in a concentration of sales to several different members and their network of members. Although _no_ single member accounted for _10%_ or more of net sales, the loss of a key member or that member’s network could have an adverse effect on the Company’s net sales and financial results.\n\n_Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations_\n\nThe Company’s contracts with customers _may_ include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged for individual products to similar customers.\n\n_Practical Expedients_\n\nThe Company generally expenses sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been _one_ year or less. These costs are recorded in commissions expense.\n\nThe Company does _not_ provide certain disclosures about unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of _one_ year or less.\n\n_8_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_3._ BALANCE SHEET COMPONENTS**\n\nThe components of certain balance sheet amounts are as follows (in thousands):\n\n_September 30, 2024_ |  _December 31, 2023_  \n---|---  \nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash:  \nCash | $| 8,423| $| 8,971  \nCash equivalents | 14,476| 47,207  \n22,899| 56,178  \nRestricted cash | 38| 39  \n$| 22,937| $| 56,217  \nInventories:  \nFinished goods | $| 3,072| $| 3,473  \nRaw materials | 632| 855  \nReserve for obsolescence | (20| )| (35| )  \n$| 3,684| $| 4,293  \nOther accrued expenses:  \nSales returns | $| 51| $| 81  \nEmployee-related expense | 598| 668  \nWarehousing, inventory-related and other | 701| 421  \n$| 1,350| $| 1,170  \nDeferred revenue:  \nUnshipped product and unredeemed product vouchers | $| 5,195| $| 4,417  \nAuto ship advances | 1,637| 1,749  \n$| 6,832| $| 6,166  \n  \n**_4._ FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS**\n\nAs of _September 30, 2024_ , cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities include the Company’s investments in money market funds, municipal debt securities, and corporate debt securities. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of _three_ months or less when purchased and have insignificant interest rate risk to be cash equivalents. Debt securities are required to be accounted for in accordance with the FASB ASC  _320,_ _Investments - Debt and Equity Securities_. As such, the Company determined its investments in debt securities held at _September 30, 2024_ should be classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders’ equity. The cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity. This amortization is included in other income (expense). Realized gains and losses, as well as interest income, are also included in other income (expense). The fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs.\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and accounts payable, approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The carrying amount of the noncurrent restricted cash approximates fair value since, absent the restrictions, the underlying assets would be included in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nAccounting standards permit companies, at their option, to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has elected to _not_ fair value existing eligible items.\n\nInvestments by significant category included in cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of each period were as follows (in thousands):\n\n___September 30, 2024___ |  ___December 31, 2023___  \n---|---  \nFair Value Level1 |  _Adjusted Cost_ |  _Gross Unrealized Gains (Losses)_ |  _Fair Value_ |  _Adjusted Cost_ |  _Gross Unrealized Gains (Losses)_ |  _Fair Value_  \nMoney market funds |  _Level 1_ | $| 8,048| $| —| $| 8,048| $| 213| $| —| $| 213  \nMunicipal debt securities |  _Level 2_ | 6,741| 2| 6,743| 1,426| 1| 1,427  \nCorporate debt securities |  _Level 2_ | 23,121| (7| )| 23,114| 45,580| (13| )| 45,567  \n_Total investments_ | $| 37,910| $| (5| )| $| 37,905| $| 47,219| $| (12| )| $| 47,207  \n  \n_1_ _FASB Topic _820,_ Fair Value Measurements, establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires the use of observable market data, when available, and prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in the following categories:_\n\n_Level _1:_ Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities._\n\n_Level _2:_ Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data._\n\n_Level _3:_ Unobservable inputs that are _not_ corroborated by market data._\n\n_9_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_5_****. LEASES**\n\nThe Company leases 7,300 square feet of corporate office space in Hong Kong with a term expiring in  _June 2026,_ and 4,900 square feet of corporate office space in Rolling Hills Estates, California with a term expiring in  _September 2030._ To help further develop the market for its products in North America, the Company leases 1,600 square feet of retail space in each of Rowland Heights, California and Richmond, British Columbia, and 2,000 square feet of retail space in Metuchen, New Jersey. The Rowland Heights, Richmond and Metuchen locations have terms expiring in  _November 2025,__February 2027,_ and  _December_ _2028,_ respectively.\n\nThe Company leases seven branch offices throughout China, and additional office space in Peru, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, India, and the Cayman Islands. The Company contracts with  _third_ parties for fulfillment and distribution operations in all of its international markets.  _None_ of the Company’s  _third_ -party logistics contracts contain a lease, as the Company does  _not_ have the right to access the warehouses or move its inventories at will.\n\nThe components of lease cost were as follows (in thousands):\n\n__Three Months Ended September 30,__ |  __Nine Months Ended September 30,__  \n---|---  \n_2024_ |  _2023_ |  _2024_ |  _2023_  \nOperating leases | $| 318| $| 320| $| 962| $| 971  \nShort-term leases | 35| 38| 107| 114  \nTotal lease cost | $| 353| $| 358| $| 1,069| $| 1,085  \n  \nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating leases liabilities was $334,000 and $253,000 for the _three_ months ended  _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ , respectively, and $961,000 and $929,000 for the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ , respectively.\n\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate related to operating leases as of _September 30, 2024_ were as follows:\n\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) | 3.7  \n---|---  \nWeighted-average discount rate | 4.3| %  \n  \nAs most of our leases do _not_ provide an implicit rate, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate, or the rate of each of its subsidiaries if available, based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments.\n\nThe annual scheduled lease payments of the Company's operating lease liabilities as of _September 30, 2024_ were as follows (in thousands):\n\nRemainder of 2024 | $| 320  \n---|---|---  \n2025 | 1,165  \n2026 | 678  \n2027 | 310  \n2028 | 304  \nThereafter | 375  \nTotal lease payments | 3,152  \nLess: imputed interest | (222| )  \nPresent value of lease liabilities | $| 2,930  \n  \nFor all asset classes, the Company elected _not_ to recognize assets or liabilities at the acquisition date for leases that, at the acquisition date, have a remaining lease term of _12_ months or less. Additionally, for all asset classes, the Company choose _not_ to separate nonlease components from lease components and instead account for the combined lease and nonlease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component.\n\n_10_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_6_****. INCOME TAXES**\n\nThe effective income tax rate for the _three_ and _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ includes estimates for foreign income inclusions such as global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) and Subpart F income. As of _September 30, 2024_ , the Company does not have a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company analyzed all sources of available income and determined that they are more likely than _not_ to realize the tax benefits of their deferred assets. As of _September 30, 2024_ , the Company has a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions with an overall net operating loss. The valuation allowance will be reduced at such time as management believes it is more likely than _not_ that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Any reductions in the valuation allowance will reduce future income tax provision.\n\nAs of _September 30, 2024_ , the Company has _zero_ U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards. The Company has post-apportioned U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $446,000 that begin expiring in _2038._ At _September 30, 2024_ , the Company has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.3 million in various jurisdictions with various expirations.\n\nAs of _September 30, 2024_ , income taxes payable for the repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income required by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), enacted in  _2017_ by the U.S. government, totaled $5.1 million, which is payable in _April 2025._\n\nAs a result of capital return activities, the Company determined that a portion of its current undistributed foreign earnings _not_ deemed reinvested indefinitely by its non-U.S. subsidiaries. For state income tax purposes, the Company will continue to periodically reassess the needs of its foreign subsidiaries and update its indefinite reinvestment assertion as necessary. To the extent that additional foreign earnings are _not_ deemed permanently reinvested, the Company expects to recognize additional income tax provision at the applicable state corporate income tax rate(s). As of _September 30, 2024_ , the Company has _not_ recorded a state deferred tax liability for earnings that the Company plans to repatriate out of accumulated earnings in future periods because all earnings as of _September 30, 2024_ have already been repatriated. Due to the Tax Act, repatriation from foreign subsidiaries will be offset with a dividends received deduction, resulting in little to _no_ impact on federal tax expense. All undistributed earnings in excess of _50%_ of current earnings on an annual basis are intended to be reinvested indefinitely as of _September 30, 2024_.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the United States, California, New Jersey, Texas and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is _no_ longer subject to state income tax examinations for years prior to _2018._ The Company is _not_ aware of any jurisdiction that is currently examining any of its income tax returns.\n\n**_7._ COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\nThe Company has employment agreements with certain members of its management team that can be terminated by either the employee or the Company upon  _four_ weeks’ notice. The employment agreements entered into with the management team contain provisions that guarantee the payment of specified amounts in the event of a change in control (together with a termination without cause), as defined, or if the employee is otherwise terminated without cause, as defined, or terminates employment for good reason, as defined.\n\n11 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_8._ STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS**\n\n_Restricted Stock_\n\nIn _2016,_ the Company’s stockholders approved the Natural Health Trends Corp. _2016_ Equity Incentive Plan (the _“2016_ Plan”) to replace its _2007_ Equity Incentive Plan. The _2016_ Plan allows for the grant of various equity awards including incentive stock options, non-statutory options, stock, stock units, stock appreciation rights and other similar equity-based awards to the Company’s employees, officers, non-employee directors, contractors, consultants and advisors of the Company. Up to 2,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (subject to adjustment under certain circumstances) _may_ be issued pursuant to awards granted. At _September 30, 2024_ , 1,129,047 shares remained available for issuance under the _2016_ Plan.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s restricted stock activity under the _2016_ Plan:\n\n_Shares_ |  _Wtd. Avg. Price at Date of Issuance_  \n---|---  \nNonvested at December 31, 2023 | 62,320| $| 4.84  \nVested | (22,768| )| $| 4.84  \nForfeited | (3,698| )| $| 4.84  \nNonvested at September 30, 2024 | 35,854| $| 4.84  \n  \nShare-based compensation expense of $34,000 and $38,000 was recognized during the _three_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ , respectively, and $109,000 and $123,000 was recognized during the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ , respectively. As of _September 30, 2024_ , total unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock was $167,000, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.7 years.\n\n_Phantom Equity_\n\nIn _2021,_ the Company’s Board of Directors approved and adopted a Phantom Equity Plan (the “Phantom Plan”). Under the terms of the Phantom Plan, the Board of Directors' Compensation Committee  _may_ grant to the Company’s employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, or advisors awards of phantom shares entitling grantees the right to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of an equal number of shares of the Company’s common stock upon the close of a vesting period, subject to any maximum payment value that the Compensation Committee  _may_ set. The vesting of phantom shares is subject to such vesting conditions as the Compensation Committee  _may_ specify in a grantee’s award agreement. Grantees of phantom shares shall  _not_ by virtue of their receipt of phantom shares have any ownership rights in shares of the Company’s common stock. The Phantom Plan shall continue for a period of ten years, after which  _no_ further phantom shares  _may_ be awarded (although any phantom shares awarded prior to the expiration of such  _10_ -year period shall be unaffected by the termination of the Phantom Plan).\n\nOn _February 7, 2023,_ the Company granted 212,937 phantom shares to certain of the Company’s employees and its non-employee directors. The phantom shares vest in  _eight_ equal three-month vesting increments, subject to the satisfaction of both a time-based vesting condition and a performance vesting condition. Both of these vesting conditions were deemed satisfied on the grant date for the initial vesting increment. In order for the time-based vesting condition to be satisfied for each vesting period, the grantee must remain continuously employed by, or be otherwise continuously providing services to, the Company through the end of the vesting period, and in order for the performance vesting condition to be satisfied for each performance period, the performance criteria designated by the Compensation Committee must be satisfied. The initial performance vesting condition will be designated by the Compensation Committee and will apply to all future performance periods, unless the Compensation Committee elects to change the performance vesting condition on a prospective basis. Future changes to the performance vesting condition must be made on or before the  _fifteenth_ day of any future performance period. If either vesting condition is  _not_ satisfied for a vesting date, then the phantom shares scheduled to vest on such date will be forfeited. These phantom shares are subject to a maximum payment value of $12.00 per phantom share. Of the phantom shares awarded in _2023,_ 159,702 phantom shares vested, 26,618 remain unvested, and 26,617 were forfeited as of _September 30, 2024_.\n\nThe phantom share awards are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic _718,_ _Compensation_ – _Stock Compensation_ since they require cash settlement. The grant date of each vesting increment will be established when the Company and the grantees reach a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of an award, which is the date upon which each performance vesting condition is communicated to the grantees. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance vesting condition will be achieved. The fair value of the liability incurred is remeasured at the end of each reporting period with any changes in fair value recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period. \n\nAs a result of the vesting of phantom shares, the Company recognized compensation expense related to the cash settlement of such shares of $181,000 and $144,000 during the during the _three_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ , respectively, and $362,000 and $404,000 during the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ , respectively.\n\n_12_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_9._ STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY**\n\n_Dividends_\n\nThe Company declared and paid cash dividends of $0.20 per common share during each of the _first_ _three_ quarters of _2024_ and _2023,_ totaling $6.9 million in each _nine_ month period. Declaration and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.\n\n_Stock Repurchases_\n\nIn _2016,_ the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the Company’s stock repurchase program _first_ approved in _2015_ from $15.0 million to $70.0 million. Any repurchases will be made in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule _10b_ -_18_ of the Exchange Act. For all or a portion of the authorized repurchase amount, the Company _may_ enter into _one_ or more plans that are compliant with Rule _10b5_ -_1_ of the Exchange Act that are designed to facilitate these purchases. The stock repurchase program does _not_ require the Company to acquire a specific number of shares, and _may_ be suspended from time to time or discontinued. As of _September 30, 2024_ , $21.9 million of the $70.0 million stock repurchase program remained available for future purchases, inclusive of related estimated income tax.\n\n_Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss_\n\nThe changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component for the _first_  _nine_ months of _2024_ were as follows (in thousands):\n\n_Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments_|  _Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Available-For-Sale Investments_|  _Total_  \n---|---|---  \nBalance, December 31, 2023 | $| (1,057| )| $| (12| )| $| (1,069| )  \nOther comprehensive loss | (114| )| (38| )| (152| )  \nBalance, March 31, 2024 | (1,171| )| (50| )| (1,221| )  \nOther comprehensive income (loss) | (36| )| 8| (28| )  \nBalance, June 30, 2024 | (1,207| )| (42| )| (1,249| )  \nOther comprehensive income | 252| 37| 289  \nBalance, September 30, 2024 | $| (955| )| $| (5| )| $| (960| )  \n  \n**_10._ RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\nThe Company is a party to a Royalty Agreement and License with Broady Health Sciences, L.L.C., a Texas limited liability company, (“BHS”) regarding the manufacture and sale of a product called ReStor™. George K. Broady, a former director of the Company and beneficial owner of more than 5% of its outstanding common stock, is an indirect owner of BHS. Lucy Nduati, a director of the Company, has since _2013_ served a number of companies controlled by George K. Broady and other Broady family members in a variety of roles focused on administration, accounting, finance, tax strategy and office management. Under this agreement (as amended), the Company agreed to pay BHS a royalty based on a price per unit in return for the right to manufacture (or have manufactured), market, import, export and sell this product worldwide by or through multi-level marketing or network marketing. The Company recognized royalties of $8 _,000_ and $11,000 during the _three_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ , respectively, and $27,000 and $33,000 during the _nine_ months ended _September 30, 2024_ and _2023_ , respectively, under this agreement. The Company is _not_ required to purchase any product under the agreement, and the agreement _may_ be terminated under certain circumstances with _no_ notice. The agreement terminates _March 31, 2025,_ after which it shall be automatically renewed for successive one-year terms unless notice is given by either party at least 90 days in advance of the expiration of the then-current term.\n\n_13_\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**_11._ SEGMENT INFORMATION**\n\nThe Company sells products to a member network that operates in a seamless manner from market to market, except for the China market where it sells to some consumers through an e-commerce platform, and the Russia and Kazakhstan market where the Company’s engagement of a _third_ -party service provider results in a different economic structure than its other markets. Otherwise, the Company believes that all of its other operating segments have similar economic characteristics and are similar in the nature of the products sold, the product acquisition process, the types of customers products are sold to, the methods used to distribute the products, and the nature of the regulatory environment. Therefore, the Company aggregates its other operating segments (including its Hong Kong operating segment) into a single reporting segment (the “Primary Reporting Segment”).\n\nThe Company reviews its net sales and operating income (loss) by operating segment, and reviews its assets and capital expenditures on a consolidated basis and _not_ by operating segment. As such, net sales and operating income (loss) are presented by reportable segment and assets and capital expenditures by operating segment are _not_ presented. Segment operating income is adjusted for certain direct costs and commission allocation.\n\nThe Company’s operating information by geographic area are as follows (in thousands):\n\n__Three Months Ended September 30,__ |  __Nine Months Ended September 30,__  \n---|---  \n_2024_ |  _2023_ |  _2024_ |  _2023_  \nNet sales:  \nPrimary Reporting Segment | $| 9,951| $| 10,249| $| 30,440| $| 31,719  \nChina | 601| 254| 1,321| 917  \nRussia and Kazakhstan | 139| 112| 356| 351  \nTotal net sales | $| 10,691| $| 10,615| $| 32,117| $| 32,987  \nIncome (loss) from operations:  \nPrimary Reporting Segment | $| 1,511| $| 1,880| $| 4,847| $| 5,208  \nChina | 160| (160| )| (10| )| (423| )  \nRussia and Kazakhstan | (31| )| (47| )| (88| )| (131| )  \nIncome from operations for reportable segments, net | 1,640| 1,673| 4,749| 4,654  \nUnallocated corporate expenses | (1,915| )| (1,965| )| (5,627| )| (6,083| )  \nOther income, net | 441| 585| 1,523| 1,708  \nIncome before income taxes | $| 166| $| 293| $| 645| $| 279  \n  \nThe Company’s net sales by geographic area are as follows (in thousands):\n\n__Three Months Ended September 30,__ |  __Nine Months Ended September 30,__  \n---|---  \n_2024_ |  _2023_ |  _2024_ |  _2023_  \nNet sales from external customers:  \nUnited States | $| 274| $| 276| $| 799| $| 827  \nCanada | 134| 180| 387| 507  \nPeru | 340| 365| 844| 1,175  \nHong Kong1 | 8,356| 8,412| 25,998| 26,391  \nChina | 601| 254| 1,321| 917  \nTaiwan | 454| 552| 1,277| 1,460  \nJapan | 81| 152| 202| 341  \nMalaysia and Singapore | 58| 54| 177| 207  \nRussia and Kazakhstan | 139| 112| 356| 351  \nEurope | 164| 182| 473| 567  \nOther foreign countries | 90| 76| 283| 244  \nTotal net sales | $| 10,691| $| 10,615| $| 32,117| $| 32,987  \n  \n_1_ _Substantially all of the Company's Hong Kong revenues are derived from the sale of products that are delivered to members in China.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nWe are an international direct-selling and e-commerce company. Subsidiaries controlled by us sell personal care, wellness, and “quality of life” products under the “NHT Global” brand. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries have an active physical presence in the following markets: the Americas, which consists of the United States, Canada, Cayman Islands, Mexico and Peru; Greater China, which consists of Hong Kong, Taiwan and China; Southeast Asia, which consists of Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand; South Korea; Japan; India; and Europe. We also operate in Russia and Kazakhstan through our engagement with a local service provider.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we were conducting business through 30,880 active members, compared to 32,410 at December 31, 2023 and 34,660 at September 30, 2023. We consider a member “active” if they have placed at least one product order with us during the preceding year. Our priority is to focus our resources in our most promising markets, which we consider to be Greater China and countries where our existing members have the connections to recruit prospects and sell our products, such as Southeast Asia, India, South America and Europe.\n\nWe generate approximately 93% of our net sales from subsidiaries located outside the Americas, with sales of our Hong Kong subsidiary representing 78% of net sales in the latest fiscal quarter. Because of the size of our foreign operations, operating results can be impacted negatively or positively by factors such as foreign currency fluctuations, inflation rates, and economic, political and business conditions around the world. In addition, our business is subject to various laws and regulations, in particular, regulations related to direct selling activities that create uncertain risks for our business, including improper claims or activities by our members and our potential inability to obtain necessary product registrations. We continually evaluate our business for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and this process can and has resulted in the identification of certain matters of potential noncompliance, which we work to satisfactorily address. For further information regarding some of the risks associated with the conduct of our business in China and Hong Kong, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and more specifically under the captions “Because our Hong Kong operations account for a substantial portion of our overall business...”, “Our Hong Kong operations are being adversely affected by recent political and social developments in Hong Kong...”, and “Our business in China is subject to compliance with a myriad of applicable laws and regulations...”.\n\nChina has been and continues to be our most important business development project. We operate an e-commerce direct selling platform in Hong Kong that generates revenue derived from the sale of products to members in Hong Kong and elsewhere, including China. Substantially all of our Hong Kong revenues are derived from the sale of products that are delivered to members in China. Through a separate Chinese entity, we operate an e-commerce retail platform in China. We believe that neither of these activities require a direct selling license in China, which we do not currently hold. We previously submitted a preliminary application for a direct selling license in China, but in 2019 a Chinese governmental authority recommended that we withdraw our application. We expect to reapply for a direct selling license in China when we believe that circumstances are again ripe for doing so. If we are ultimately able to obtain a direct selling license in China, we believe that the incentives inherent in the direct selling model in China would incrementally benefit our existing business. We do not expect that any increased sales in China derived from obtaining a direct selling license would initially be material and, in any event may be partially offset by the higher fixed costs associated with the establishment and maintenance of required service centers, branch offices, manufacturing facilities, certification programs and other legal requirements. We are unable to predict whether and when we will be successful in obtaining a direct selling license to operate in China, and if we are successful, when we will be permitted to conduct direct selling operations and whether such operations would be profitable.\n\n16 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nIn January 2019 the Chinese government announced a 100-day campaign focused on companies involved in the sale of food, equipment, daily necessities, small home electrical appliances and services that are claimed to promote health. The Chinese government ministries in charge of this campaign indicated that they were targeting illegal practices in the industry, particularly the manufacture and sale of counterfeit and substandard products, and false advertising and misleading claims as to the health benefits of products and services. It is understood that the campaign was specifically focused on the business practices of direct selling companies. The campaign and associated negative media coverage resulted in a significant adverse impact on our business, as consumers widely curtailed their purchases within the affected industries. We, like some of our peers, voluntarily decided in January 2019 to temporarily suspend our member activities, such as product roadshows, product trainings and larger company-sponsored events, in China. We did this because we learned that the 100-day campaign was announced in broad outlines by the central government, and the interpretation and enforcement of the campaign was delegated to the provincial and local governments. We consider it a top priority for our business to develop an understanding of and cooperate with all levels and jurisdictions of the government agencies, and did not want to run the risk of being inadvertently entangled in government enforcement actions as the provincial and local governments formulate and implement their interpretive guidance and rule-making. Although we have been able to relax some restrictions on member activities in certain markets, it may again in the future be necessary or advisable to suspend member activities or take similar actions from time to time, and such periods of reduced activity may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nAlthough the 100-day campaign was due to expire in April 2019, we are not aware of any information indicating that the campaign has formally concluded. However, the Chinese government subsequently announced that it would conduct a “look-back review” to evaluate the 100-day campaign. As part of this review, we understand that various Chinese governmental agencies formed a working group to assess the 100-day campaign, particularly focusing on the health market and its supervision in certain provinces. We understand that during September 2019 the working group evaluated the performance and results of a number of organizations and governmental departments in these provinces and made recommendations for various improvements. It was noted that each province had opened a number of investigative cases, had successfully closed numerous cases, and had imposed various fines and penalties. We understand that the look-back review continued after September 2019, and we are not aware that this review has been completed. As a result, the business environment in China for health product companies continues to be challenging, which has been exacerbated by negative social media sentiment expressed for these types of companies. We believe that the campaign, as well as its extension and aftermath (including the look-back review), will continue to negatively impact our business in China in the near-term, but will ultimately benefit us and Chinese consumers in the long-term as purveyors of substandard products are driven from the market.\n\nIn late 2019 or early 2020 an outbreak of COVID-19 was first identified in China and subsequently spread around the world. On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The outbreak caused the Chinese government to implement powerful measures to control the virus, such as requiring businesses to close throughout various areas of China and restricting public gatherings and certain travel within the country. We have significant business in China and in 2023 generated approximately 79% of our revenue in Hong Kong, substantially all of which was derived from the sale of products to members in China. Over the course of the pandemic, we took steps to adapt some of our marketing programs, such as relying on certain product promotions and webcast training, to overcome the physical restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic. In late 2022, the Chinese and Hong Kong governments took comprehensive steps to relax many of their COVID-19 control measures, although the cumulative effect of the disruptions associated with the pandemic materially negatively impacted our financial results from 2020 through 2022. This less restrictive business environment in China and Hong Kong continued throughout 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, and we have been able to sponsor in-person member events in China, Hong Kong and/or Macau during each quarter since the first quarter of 2023. We are continuing to plan and sponsor more such events consistent with normal operations. Nevertheless, it may be too early to accurately predict the impact on us and our third-party providers of this relaxation of control measures and whether it will prove enduring. Ultimately, the severity of the impact on us of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the virus, and the related control measures, which we are unable to accurately predict. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war…” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nRecent political and social developments in Hong Kong, along with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government control measures, are also adversely affecting our Hong Kong operations and led us in 2020 to cease sponsoring member meetings and events in Hong Kong. Inasmuch as member meetings and events located in Hong Kong have in the past served as an important component of our product marketing and distribution efforts, we believe that these developments negatively affected our past operations and financial performance. Although we have been able to sponsor in-person member events in Hong Kong in recent quarters, it may be too early to predict whether these developments will continue to adversely affect our overall business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our Hong Kong operations are being adversely affected by recent political and social developments in Hong Kong...” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n17 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**Statement of Operations Presentation**\n\nWe mainly derive revenue from sales of products. Substantially all of our product sales are to independent members at published wholesale prices. Product sales are recognized when the products are shipped and title passes to independent members, which generally is upon our delivery to the carrier that completes delivery to the members. We estimate and accrue a reserve for product returns based on our return policies and historical experience. We bill members for shipping charges and recognize the freight revenue in net sales. We have elected to account for shipping and handling activities performed after title has passed to members as a fulfillment cost, and accrue for the costs of shipping and handling if revenue is recognized before the contractually obligated shipping and handling activities occurs. Event and training revenue is deferred and recognized as the event or training occurs.\n\nCost of sales consists primarily of products purchased from third-party manufacturers, freight cost for transporting products to our foreign subsidiaries and shipping products to members, import duties, packing materials, product royalties, costs of promotional materials sold to our members at or near cost, and provisions for slow moving or obsolete inventories. Cost of sales also includes purchasing costs, receiving costs, inspection costs and warehousing costs.\n\nMember commissions are our most significant expense and are classified as an operating expense. Under our compensation plan, members are paid weekly commissions by our subsidiary in which they are enrolled, generally in their home country currency, for product purchases by their down-line member network across all geographic markets. Our China subsidiary maintains an e-commerce retail platform and does not pay commissions, although our Chinese members may participate in our compensation plan through our other subsidiaries. This “seamless” compensation plan enables a member located in one country to enroll other members located in other countries where we are authorized to conduct our business. Currently, there are basically two ways in which our members can earn income:\n\n• |  through commissions paid on the accumulated bonus volume from product purchases made by their down-line members and customers; and  \n---|---  \n• |  through retail profits on sales of products purchased by members at wholesale prices and resold at retail prices (for purchasers in some of our smaller markets and purchasers from our China subsidiary, sales are for personal consumption only and income may not be earned through retail profits).  \n---|---  \n  \nEach of our products is designated a specified number of bonus volume points. Commissions are based on total personal and group bonus volume points per weekly sales period. Bonus volume points are essentially a percentage of a product’s wholesale price. As the member’s business expands from successfully enrolling other members who in turn expand their own businesses by selling product to other members, the member receives higher commissions from purchases made by an expanding down-line network. In some of our markets, to be eligible to receive commissions, a member may be required to make nominal monthly or other periodic purchases of our products. Certain of our subsidiaries do not require these nominal purchases for a member to be eligible to receive commissions. In determining commissions, the number of levels of down-line members included within the member’s commissionable group increases as the number of memberships directly below the member increases.\n\n18 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nUnder our current compensation plan, certain of our commission payouts may be limited to a hard cap dollar amount per week or a specific percentage of total product sales. In some markets, commissions may be further limited. In some markets, we also pay certain bonuses on purchases by up to three generations of personally sponsored members, as well as bonuses on commissions earned by up to seven generations of personally sponsored members. Members can also earn additional income, trips and other prizes in specific time-limited promotions and contests we hold from time to time. Member commissions are dependent on the sales mix and, for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, represented 41% and 42% of net sales, respectively. Occasionally, we make modifications and enhancements to our compensation plan to help motivate members, which can have an impact on member commissions. We may also enter into performance-based agreements for business or market development, which can result in additional compensation to specific members.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of administrative compensation and benefits, travel, credit card fees and assessments, professional fees, certain occupancy costs, and other corporate administrative expenses (including stock-based compensation). In addition, this category includes selling, marketing, and promotion expenses (including the costs of member training events and conventions that are designed to increase both product awareness and member recruitment). Because our various member conventions are not always held at the same time each year, interim period comparisons will be impacted accordingly.\n\nThe functional currency of our international subsidiaries is generally their local currency. Local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the period. Equity accounts are translated at historical rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly into stockholders’ equity.\n\nSales by our foreign subsidiaries are generally transacted in the respective local currencies and are translated into U.S. dollars using average rates of exchange for each monthly accounting period to which they relate. Most of our product purchases from third-party manufacturers are transacted in U.S. dollars. Consequently, our sales and net earnings are affected by changes in currency exchange rates, with sales and earnings generally increasing with a weakening U.S. dollar and decreasing with a strengthening U.S. dollar.\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nThe following table sets forth our operating results as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated.\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, |  Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 |  2023 |  2024 |  2023  \nNet sales | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %  \nCost of sales | 25.9 | 25.3 | 26.1 | 25.4  \nGross profit | 74.1 | 74.7 | 73.9 | 74.6  \nOperating expenses:  \nCommissions expense | 40.5 | 41.1 | 40.5 | 42.0  \nSelling, general and administrative expenses | 36.2 | 36.3 | 36.1 | 36.9  \nTotal operating expenses | 76.7 | 77.4 | 76.6 | 78.9  \nLoss from operations | (2.6 | ) | (2.7 | ) | (2.7 | ) | (4.3 | )  \nOther income, net | 4.1 | 5.5 | 4.7 | 5.2  \nIncome before income taxes | 1.5 | 2.8 | 2.0 | 0.9  \nIncome tax provision | 1.2 | 1.2 | 0.8 | 0.2  \nNet income | 0.3 | % | 1.6 | % | 1.2 | % | 0.7 | %  \n  \n19 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_Net_ _Sales_\n\nThe following table sets forth revenue by market for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, |  Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 |  2023 |  2024 |  2023  \nAmericas1 | $ | 748 | 7.0 | % | $ | 821 | 7.8 | % | $ | 2,030 | 6.3 | % | $ | 2,509 | 7.6 | %  \nHong Kong2 | 8,356 | 78.2 | 8,412 | 79.2 | 25,998 | 80.9 | 26,391 | 80.0  \nChina | 601 | 5.6 | 254 | 2.4 | 1,321 | 4.1 | 917 | 2.8  \nTaiwan | 454 | 4.2 | 552 | 5.2 | 1,277 | 4.0 | 1,460 | 4.4  \nSouth Korea | 31 | 0.3 | 34 | 0.3 | 122 | 0.4 | 124 | 0.4  \nJapan | 81 | 0.8 | 152 | 1.4 | 202 | 0.6 | 341 | 1.0  \nMalaysia and Singapore | 58 | 0.5 | 54 | 0.5 | 177 | 0.6 | 207 | 0.6  \nRussia and Kazakhstan | 139 | 1.3 | 112 | 1.1 | 356 | 1.1 | 351 | 1.1  \nEurope | 164 | 1.5 | 182 | 1.7 | 473 | 1.5 | 567 | 1.7  \nIndia | 59 | 0.6 | 42 | 0.4 | 161 | 0.5 | 120 | 0.4  \nTotal | $ | 10,691 | 100.0 | % | $ | 10,615 | 100.0 | % | $ | 32,117 | 100.0 | % | $ | 32,987 | 100.0 | %  \n  \n1 _United States, Canada, Mexico and Peru_\n\n2 _Substantially all of our Hong Kong revenues are derived from the sale of products that are delivered to members in China. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K._\n\nNet sales were $10.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with $10.6 million for the comparable period a year ago, an increase of $76,000, or 1%. Hong Kong net sales, substantially all of which were derived from the sale of products shipped to members residing in China, were almost the same for each of the three-month periods, decreasing $56,000, or less than 1%, over the comparable period a year ago. Outside of our Hong Kong business, net sales increased $132,000, or 6%, over the comparable three-month period a year ago, primarily due to the increased quarter-over-quarter net sales in our Chinese e-commerce retail business.\n\nNet sales were $32.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with $33.0 million for the comparable period a year ago, a decrease of $870,000, or 3%. Hong Kong net sales, substantially all of which were derived from the sale of products shipped to members residing in China, were almost the same for each of the nine-month periods, decreasing $393,000, or 1%, over the comparable period a year ago. Hong Kong net sales were also adversely affected by the recognition of lower administrative fees in the current-year period, as compared to the prior-year period last year, as increased activity within member electronic wallet (eWallet) accounts resulted in less fees assessed during the current-year period. Outside of our Hong Kong business, net sales decreased $477,000, or 7%, over the comparable nine-month period a year ago, primarily due to the decreased period-over-period net sales in our business in the Americas (which was somewhat offset by increased period-over-period net sales in our Chinese e-commerce retail business). As of September 30, 2024, deferred revenue was $6.8 million, which consisted of $5.2 million pertaining to unshipped product orders and unredeemed product vouchers, as well as $1.6 million in auto ship advances.\n\n_Gross Profit_\n\nGross profit was 74.1% of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 74.7% of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit was 73.9% of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 74.6% of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in gross profit margin for both the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher costs related to our Premium Noni Juice product.\n\n_Commissions Expense_\n\nCommissions were 40.5% of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 41.1% of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Commissions were 40.5% of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 42.0% of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in commissions as a percentage of net sales during both the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower weekly commissions earned outside of our Hong Kong business.\n\n_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $3.9 million for each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $11.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $12.2 million in the same period a year ago. The decrease for the nine-month period was primarily due to lower professional fees and insurance expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were roughly the same as the comparable period in the prior year and were modestly lower for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 than the same period a year ago.\n\n_Other Income, Net_\n\nOther income was $441,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with $585,000 in the same period a year ago. Other income was $1.5 million and $1.7 million for each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to less interest income earned during each of the current year periods.\n\n20 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n_Income Taxes_\n\nAn income tax provision of $131,000 and $121,000 were recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. An income tax provision of $249,000 and $69,000 were recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The tax provision during each of the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily resulted from foreign income inclusions, such as global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) and Subpart F income, tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions and year-to-date consolidated income through September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAt September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $46.3 million. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by $9.9 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 due to the dividends paid during the first nine months of 2024 and the payment of the repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income as required by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, we had $37.9 million in available-for-sale investments classified as either cash equivalents or marketable securities. In addition, cash and cash equivalents included $3.8 million held in banks located within China subject to foreign currency controls.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.6 to 1.0 and we had $32.7 million of working capital. Working capital as of September 30, 2024 decreased $11.5 million compared to our working capital as of December 31, 2023.\n\nCash used in operations was $3.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with $4.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. Income tax paid during April 2024 and April 2023 for the repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income was $4.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively. Disregarding these payments, cash flows from operations improved $1.7 million primarily due to improved management of inventories and operating costs during the first nine months of 2024 as compared to the same period last year, as well as a timing difference related to weekly commission outflows.\n\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $23.1 million and $32,000 during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the first nine months of 2024, we purchased $44.8 million in marketable securities with original maturities greater than three months, and as such, reflect these purchases as an investing activity. These purchases of marketable securities were offset by $21.8 million of proceeds received from maturities of marketable securities.\n\nCash flows used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 consisted solely of quarterly dividend payments of $0.20 per common share, totaling $6.9 million in each period. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, on October 28, 2024, the Board of Directors declared another quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 on each share of common stock outstanding. The dividend will be payable on November 22, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 12, 2024. We expect to continue paying a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 on each share of common stock outstanding for the foreseeable future. However, any future cash dividends will be at the sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2016, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the Company’s stock repurchase program first approved in 2015 from $15.0 million to $70.0 million. Any repurchases will be made in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. For all or a portion of the authorized repurchase amount, the Company may enter into one or more plans that are compliant with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act that are designed to facilitate these purchases. The stock repurchase program does not require the Company to acquire a specific number of shares, and may be suspended from time to time or discontinued. As of September 30, 2024, $21.9 million of the $70.0 million stock repurchase program remained available for future purchases, inclusive of related estimated income tax.\n\nWe believe that our existing internal liquidity, supported by cash on hand and cash flows from operations, should be adequate to fund normal business operations and address our financial commitments for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe do not have any significant unused sources of liquid assets. If necessary, we may attempt to generate more funding from the capital markets, but currently we do not believe that will be necessary.\n\n21 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\nOur priority is to focus our resources on investing in our most important markets, which we consider to be Greater China and countries where our existing members may have the connections to recruit prospects and sell our products, such as Southeast Asia, India, South America and Europe. We will continue to invest in our Mainland China entity for such purposes as establishing China-based manufacturing capabilities, increasing public awareness of our brand and our products, sourcing more Chinese-made products, building a chain of service stations, opening additional Healthy Lifestyle Centers or branch offices, adding local staffing and other requirements for a prospective China direct selling license application.\n\n**Critical Accounting Estimates**\n\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require our management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. There are items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical, as defined above.\n\nFor a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies and related judgments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 28, 2024.\n\n**[](# \"item3\")Item 3.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES**\n\n**Disclosure Controls and Procedures**\n\nManagement, with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of September 30, 2024. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting**\n\nThere were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.\n\n22 \n\n[Table of Contents](#toc)\n\n**[](# \"part2\")PART II — OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**[](# \"2item1\")Item 1.

These statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning, among other things, future\nrevenue, earnings, growth strategies, new products and initiatives, future operations and operating results, and future business and market opportunities.\nForward-looking statements in this report speak only as of the date hereof, and forward-looking statements in documents incorporated by reference speak only as of\nthe date of those documents. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events\nor otherwise, except as required by law. We caution and advise readers that these statements are based on certain assumptions that may not be realized and involve risks and\nuncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and beliefs contained herein.\nFor a summary of certain risks related to our business, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes the\nfollowing:\n• Because our Hong Kong operations account for a substantial portion of our overall business, and substantially all of our Hong Kong business is derived from the\nsale of products to members in China, any material adverse change in our business relating to either Hong Kong or China would likely have a material adverse\nimpact on our overall business;\n• Our Hong Kong operations are being adversely affected by recent political and social developments in Hong Kong, and the negative impact on our operations and\nfinancial performance could continue or intensify;\n• We experienced negative operating cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and only modest positive operating cash flows during the\nyears ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Unless our operating cash flows improve, this negative financial performance could have a material adverse effect on\nour business and our stock price;\n• Adverse publicity associated with our products, ingredients or network marketing program, or those of similar companies, could harm our financial condition and\noperating results;\n• Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment;\n• We are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of revenue diversification;\n• Epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility may seriously harm our business;\n• The high level of competition in our industry could adversely affect our business;\n• Failure of new products to gain member and market acceptance could harm our business;\n• We rely on a limited number of independent third parties to manufacture and supply our products on a timely basis;\n• Growth may be impeded by the political and economic risks of entering and operating in foreign markets;\n• Failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively impact our business and the market price of our\ncommon stock;\n• We could be adversely affected by management changes or an inability to attract and retain key management, directors and consultants;\n• Our recent loss of a significant number of members is adversely affecting our business, and if we cannot stabilize or increase the number of members our business\ncould be further negatively impacted;\n• Although virtually all of our members are independent contractors, improper member actions that violate laws or regulations could harm our business;\n• An increase in the amount of compensation paid to members would reduce profitability;\n• We may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our members and service providers, which could harm our financial\ncondition and operating results;\n• Our business in China is subject to compliance with a myriad of applicable laws and regulations, and any actual or alleged violations of those laws or government\nactions otherwise directed at us could have a material adverse impact on our business and the value of our company;\n• Changes in government trade and economic policies, including the imposition or threatened imposition of tariffs and other restrictive trade policies, and ongoing\npolitical and economic disputes between the United States and other jurisdictions, particularly China, may have a negative effect on global economic conditions\nand our business, financial results and financial condition;\n• Direct-selling laws and regulations may prohibit or severely restrict our direct sales efforts and cause our revenue and profitability to decline, and regulators could\nadopt new regulations that harm our business;\n• Our business is subject to a variety of laws, regulations and other obligations regarding privacy, data protection and information security. Any actual or perceived\nfailure by us or our third-party vendors to comply with such laws, regulations or other obligations could materially adversely affect our business;\n• Challenges by third parties to the legality of our business operations could harm our business;\n• We have in the past been involved in, and may in the future face, lawsuits, claims, and governmental proceedings and inquiries that could harm our business;\n• Currency exchange rate fluctuations could lower our revenue and net income;\n• Changes in tax or duty laws, and unanticipated tax or duty liabilities, could adversely affect our net income;\n• Transfer pricing regulations affect our business and results of operations;\n• Our products and related activities are subject to extensive government regulation, which could delay, limit or prevent the sale of some of our products in some\nmarkets;\n• New regulations governing the marketing and sale of nutritional supplements could harm our business;\n• Regulations governing the production and marketing of our personal care products could harm our business;\n• If we are found not to be in compliance with good manufacturing practices our operations could be harmed;\n• Failure to comply with domestic and foreign laws and regulations governing product claims and advertising could harm our business;\n• We are subject to anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n• We do not have a comprehensive product liability insurance program and product liability claims could hurt our business;\nTable of Contents\n• We may be unable to protect or use our intellectual property rights;\n• We rely on and are subject to risks associated with our reliance upon information technology systems;\n• System disruptions or failures, cybersecurity risks, and compromises of data, or the failure to comply with related laws and regulations, could harm our business;\n• Our systems, software and data reside on third-party servers, exposing us to risks that disruption or intrusion of those servers could temporarily or permanently\ninterrupt our access and damage our business;\n• Our common stock is particularly subject to volatility because of the industry and markets in which we operate; and\n• Our common stock continues to experience wide fluctuations in trading volumes and prices. This may make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to\nsell shares when they want and at prices they find attractive.\nAdditional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are set forth in this report, including under the headings\n“Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in our financial statements and the related notes.\nTable of Contents\nPART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

Contents\nNATURAL HEALTH TRENDS CORP.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\n1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Operations\nNatural Health Trends Corp., a Delaware corporation (whether or not including its subsidiaries, the “Company”), is an international direct-selling and e-commerce\ncompany. Subsidiaries controlled by the Company sell personal care, wellness, and “quality of life” products under the “NHT Global” brand.\nThe Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries have an active physical presence in the following markets: the Americas, which consists of the United States, Canada,\nCayman Islands, Mexico and Peru; Greater China, which consists of Hong Kong, Taiwan and China; Southeast Asia, which consists of Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand;\nSouth Korea; Japan; India; and Europe. The Company also operates in Russia and Kazakhstan through an engagement with a local service provider.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. As a result, certain information and footnote\ndisclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been\ncondensed or omitted. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal\nrecurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s financial information for the interim periods presented. The results of operations of any\ninterim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the fiscal year. These consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the United States\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 28, 2024.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company maintains substantially all of its cash balances at several institutions located in the United States, Hong Kong and China which at times may exceed\ninsured limits. As of September 30, 2024, there was $29,000 and $509,000 in bank accounts located in the United States and Hong Kong, respectively, in excess of insured\nlimits. As of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents included $3.8 million held in bank accounts located in China subject to foreign currency controls. The\nCompany has not experienced any losses on such accounts. See Note 4 for additional information regarding the Company's investments in cash equivalents held in\nbrokerage accounts.\nNet Income Per Common Share\nDiluted net income per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive\neffect of common stock equivalents. The dilutive effect of non-vested restricted stock is reflected by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock\nmethod, the amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized, if any, is assumed to be used to repurchase shares.\nThe following table illustrates the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nIncome Shares Per Share Income Shares Per Share\n(Numerator) (Denominator) Amount (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount\nBasic net income per common share:\nNet income available to common stockholders $ 35 11,471 $ 0.00 $ 172 11,440 $ 0.02\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nNon-vested restricted stock — 19 — 14\nDiluted net income per common share:\nNet income available to common stockholders\nplus assumed dilution $ 35 11,490 $ 0.00 $ 172 11,454 $ 0.02\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nIncome Shares Per Share Income Shares Per Share\n(Numerator) (Denominator) Amount (Numerator) (Denominator) Amount\nBasic net income per common share:\nNet income available to common stockholders $ 396 11,464 $ 0.03 $ 210 11,432 $ 0.02\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nNon-vested restricted stock — 24 — 17\nDiluted net income per common share:\nNet income available to common stockholders\nplus assumed dilution $ 396 11,488 $ 0.03 $ 210 11,449 $ 0.02\n6\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures, which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The\namendments in ASU 2023-07 will be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of implementing this guidance.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which enhances the transparency and\ndecision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 will be applied on a prospective basis and are effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of implementing this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nOther recently issued accounting pronouncements did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial\nstatements.\n2. REVENUE\nRevenue Recognition\nAll revenue is recognized when the performance obligations under a contract, including any product vouchers sold on a stand-alone basis in Hong Kong, are satisfied.\nProduct sales are recognized when the products are shipped and title passes to independent members. Product sales to members are made pursuant to a member agreement\nthat provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon the Company’s delivery to the carrier that completes delivery to the members, which is commonly referred to as\n“F.O.B. Shipping Point.” The Company’s sales arrangements do not contain right of inspection or customer acceptance provisions other than general rights of return. These\ncontracts are generally short-term in nature.\nActual product returns are recorded as a reduction to net sales. The Company estimates and accrues a reserve for product returns based on its return policies and\nhistorical experience. The reserve is based upon the return policy of each country, which varies from 14 days to one year, and their historical return rates, which range from\n1% to 7% of sales. Sales returns were 1% of sales for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. No material changes in estimates have been recognized\nduring the periods presented. See Note 3 for additional information.\nThe Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities performed after title has passed to members as a fulfillment cost, and accrues for the costs\nof shipping and handling if revenue is recognized before the contractually obligated shipping and handling activities occurs. Shipping charges billed to members are\nincluded in net sales. Costs associated with shipments are included in cost of sales. Event and training revenue is deferred and recognized as the event or training occurs.\nCosts of events and member training are included within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nVarious taxes on the sale of products to members are collected by the Company as an agent and remitted to the respective taxing authority. These taxes are presented\non a net basis and recorded as a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority.\nDeferred Revenue\nThe Company primarily receives payment by credit card at the time members place orders. Amounts received for unshipped product orders and unredeemed product\nvouchers are considered a contract liability and are recorded as deferred revenue. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $5.2 million and\n$4.4 million, respectively, of contract liabilities where performance obligations have not yet been satisfied. The increase in contract liabilities from December 31, 2023 to\nSeptember 30, 2024 is primarily due to $5.2 million of cash received for unshipped product orders and unredeemed product vouchers during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 offset by $4.4 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in contract liabilities at December 31, 2023. As of December 31,\n2022, the Company had contract liabilities totaling $3.8 million of which $3.8 million was recognized as revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The\nCompany expects to satisfy its remaining performance obligations and recognize the revenue within the next twelve months.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe Company sells products to a member network that operates in a seamless manner from market to market, except for the Chinese market where it sells to\nconsumers through an e-commerce retail platform and the Russia and Kazakhstan market where the Company operates through an engagement of a third-party service\nprovider. See Note 11 for revenue by market information.\n7\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s net sales by product and service are as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProduct sales $ 10,412 $ 10,303 $ 31,261 $ 31,505\nAdministrative fees, freight and other 373 373 1,092 1,628\nLess: sales returns (94) (61) (236) (146)\nTotal net sales $ 10,691 $ 10,615 $ 32,117 $ 32,987\nConcentration\nNo single market other than Hong Kong had net sales greater than 10% of total net sales. Sales are made to the Company’s members and no single customer\naccounted for 10% or more of net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. However, the Company’s business model can result in a\nconcentration of sales to several different members and their network of members. Although no single member accounted for 10% or more of net sales, the loss of a key\nmember or that member’s network could have an adverse effect on the Company’s net sales and financial results.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nThe Company’s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenues to each\nperformance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged for individual\nproducts to similar customers.\nPractical Expedients\nThe Company generally expenses sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded in\ncommissions expense.\nThe Company does not provide certain disclosures about unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.\n8\nTable of Contents\n3.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities include the Company’s investments in money market funds, municipal debt securities,\nand corporate debt securities. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased and have insignificant\ninterest rate risk to be cash equivalents. Debt securities are required to be accounted for in accordance with the FASB ASC 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities.\nAs such, the Company determined its investments in debt securities held at September 30, 2024 should be classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value with\nunrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders’ equity. The cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity. This amortization\nis included in other income (expense). Realized gains and losses, as well as interest income, are also included in other income (expense). The fair values of securities are\nbased on quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and accounts payable, approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The\ncarrying amount of the noncurrent restricted cash approximates fair value since, absent the restrictions, the underlying assets would be included in cash and cash\nequivalents.\nAccounting standards permit companies, at their option, to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has\nelected to not fair value existing eligible items.\nInvestments by significant category included in cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of each period were as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nGross\nFair Value Gross Unrealized Unrealized Gains\nLevel1 Adjusted Cost Gains (Losses) Fair Value Adjusted Cost (Losses) Fair Value\nMoney market funds Level 1 $ 8,048 $ — $ 8,048 $ 213 $ — $ 213\nMunicipal debt securities Level 2 6,741 2 6,743 1,426 1 1,427\nCorporate debt securities Level 2 23,121 (7) 23,114 45,580 (13) 45,567\nTotal investments $ 37,910 $ (5) $ 37,905 $ 47,219 $ (12) $ 47,207\n1 FASB Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements, establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires the use of observable market data, when available, and prioritizes the inputs to\nvaluation techniques used to measure fair value in the following categories:\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\n9\nTable of Contents\n5. LEASES\nThe Company leases 7,300 square feet of corporate office space in Hong Kong with a term expiring in June 2026, and 4,900 square feet of corporate office space in\nRolling Hills Estates, California with a term expiring in September 2030. To help further develop the market for its products in North America, the Company\nleases 1,600 square feet of retail space in each of Rowland Heights, California and Richmond, British Columbia, and 2,000 square feet of retail space in Metuchen, New\nJersey. The Rowland Heights, Richmond and Metuchen locations have terms expiring in November 2025, February 2027, and December 2028, respectively.\nThe Company leases seven branch offices throughout China, and additional office space in Peru, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, India, and the\nCayman Islands. The Company contracts with third parties for fulfillment and distribution operations in all of its international markets. None of the Company’s third-party\nlogistics contracts contain a lease, as the Company does not have the right to access the warehouses or move its inventories at will.\nThe components of lease cost were as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating leases $ 318 $ 320 $ 962 $ 971\nShort-term leases 35 38 107 114\nTotal lease cost $ 353 $ 358 $ 1,069 $ 1,085\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating leases liabilities was $334,000 and $253,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively, and $961,000 and $929,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate related to operating leases as of September 30, 2024 were as follows:\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 3.7\nWeighted-average discount rate 4.3%\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate, or the rate of each of its subsidiaries if available, based on the\ninformation available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments.\nThe annual scheduled lease payments of the Company's operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\nRemainder of 2024 $ 320\n2025 1,165\n2026 678\n2027 310\n2028 304\nThereafter 375\nTotal lease payments 3,152\nLess: imputed interest (222)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,930\nFor all asset classes, the Company elected not to recognize assets or liabilities at the acquisition date for leases that, at the acquisition date, have a remaining lease\nterm of 12 months or less. Additionally, for all asset classes, the Company choose not to separate nonlease components from lease components and instead account for the\ncombined lease and nonlease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component.\n10\nTable of Contents\n6. INCOME TAXES\nThe effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes estimates for foreign income inclusions such as global intangible low-\ntaxed income (“GILTI”) and Subpart F income. As of September 30, 2024, the Company does not have a valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets. The\nCompany analyzed all sources of available income and determined that they are more likely than not to realize the tax benefits of their deferred assets. As of September 30,\n2024, the Company has a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions with an overall net operating loss. The valuation allowance will be\nreduced at such time as management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Any reductions in the valuation allowance will reduce\nfuture income tax provision.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company has zero U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards. The Company has post-apportioned U.S. state net operating loss\ncarryforwards of $446,000 that begin expiring in 2038. At September 30, 2024, the Company has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.3 million in\nvarious jurisdictions with various expirations.\nAs of September 30, 2024, income taxes payable for the repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income required by the U.S. Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act (the “Tax Act”), enacted in 2017 by the U.S. government, totaled $5.1 million, which is payable in April 2025.\nAs a result of capital return activities, the Company determined that a portion of its current undistributed foreign earnings not deemed reinvested indefinitely by its\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries. For state income tax purposes, the Company will continue to periodically reassess the needs of its foreign subsidiaries and update its indefinite\nreinvestment assertion as necessary. To the extent that additional foreign earnings are not deemed permanently reinvested, the Company expects to recognize additional\nincome tax provision at the applicable state corporate income tax rate(s). As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not recorded a state deferred tax liability for earnings\nthat the Company plans to repatriate out of accumulated earnings in future periods because all earnings as of September 30, 2024 have already been repatriated. Due to the\nTax Act, repatriation from foreign subsidiaries will be offset with a dividends received deduction, resulting in little to no impact on federal tax expense. All undistributed\nearnings in excess of 50% of current earnings on an annual basis are intended to be reinvested indefinitely as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the United States, California, New Jersey, Texas and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer\nsubject to state income tax examinations for years prior to 2018. The Company is not aware of any jurisdiction that is currently examining any of its income tax returns.\n7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe Company has employment agreements with certain members of its management team that can be terminated by either the employee or the Company\nupon four weeks’ notice. The employment agreements entered into with the management team contain provisions that guarantee the payment of specified amounts in the\nevent of a change in control (together with a termination without cause), as defined, or if the employee is otherwise terminated without cause, as defined, or terminates\nemployment for good reason, as defined.\n11\nTable of Contents\n8. STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE PLANS\nRestricted Stock\nIn 2016, the Company’s stockholders approved the Natural Health Trends Corp. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”) to replace its 2007 Equity Incentive\nPlan. The 2016 Plan allows for the grant of various equity awards including incentive stock options, non-statutory options, stock, stock units, stock appreciation rights and\nother similar equity-based awards to the Company’s employees, officers, non-employee directors, contractors, consultants and advisors of the Company. Up to 2,500,000\nshares of the Company’s common stock (subject to adjustment under certain circumstances) may be issued pursuant to awards granted. At September 30, 2024,\n1,129,047 shares remained available for issuance under the 2016 Plan.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s restricted stock activity under the 2016 Plan:\nWtd. Avg. Price at\nShares Date of Issuance\nNonvested at December 31, 2023 62,320 $ 4.84\nVested (22,768) $ 4.84\nForfeited (3,698) $ 4.84\nNonvested at September 30, 2024 35,854 $ 4.84\nShare-based compensation expense of $34,000 and $38,000 was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $109,000\nand $123,000 was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, total unrecognized share-based\ncompensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock was $167,000, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.7 years.\nPhantom Equity\nIn 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved and adopted a Phantom Equity Plan (the “Phantom Plan”). Under the terms of the Phantom Plan, the Board of\nDirectors' Compensation Committee may grant to the Company’s employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, or advisors awards of phantom shares entitling\ngrantees the right to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of an equal number of shares of the Company’s common stock upon the close of a vesting period,\nsubject to any maximum payment value that the Compensation Committee may set. The vesting of phantom shares is subject to such vesting conditions as the\nCompensation Committee may specify in a grantee’s award agreement. Grantees of phantom shares shall not by virtue of their receipt of phantom shares have any\nownership rights in shares of the Company’s common stock. The Phantom Plan shall continue for a period of ten years, after which no further phantom shares may be\nawarded (although any phantom shares awarded prior to the expiration of such 10-year period shall be unaffected by the termination of the Phantom Plan).\nOn February 7, 2023, the Company granted 212,937 phantom shares to certain of the Company’s employees and its non-employee directors. The phantom shares\nvest in eight equal three-month vesting increments, subject to the satisfaction of both a time-based vesting condition and a performance vesting condition. Both of these\nvesting conditions were deemed satisfied on the grant date for the initial vesting increment. In order for the time-based vesting condition to be satisfied for each vesting\nperiod, the grantee must remain continuously employed by, or be otherwise continuously providing services to, the Company through the end of the vesting period, and in\norder for the performance vesting condition to be satisfied for each performance period, the performance criteria designated by the Compensation Committee must be\nsatisfied. The initial performance vesting condition will be designated by the Compensation Committee and will apply to all future performance periods, unless the\nCompensation Committee elects to change the performance vesting condition on a prospective basis. Future changes to the performance vesting condition must be made on\nor before the fifteenth day of any future performance period. If either vesting condition is not satisfied for a vesting date, then the phantom shares scheduled to vest on such\ndate will be forfeited. These phantom shares are subject to a maximum payment value of $12.00 per phantom share. Of the phantom shares awarded in 2023,\n159,702 phantom shares vested, 26,618 remain unvested, and 26,617 were forfeited as of September 30, 2024.\nThe phantom share awards are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation since they require cash\nsettlement. The grant date of each vesting increment will be established when the Company and the grantees reach a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions\nof an award, which is the date upon which each performance vesting condition is communicated to the grantees. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite\nservice period if it is probable that the performance vesting condition will be achieved. The fair value of the liability incurred is remeasured at the end of each reporting\nperiod with any changes in fair value recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period.\nAs a result of the vesting of phantom shares, the Company recognized compensation expense related to the cash settlement of such shares of $181,000 and $144,000\nduring the during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $362,000 and $404,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively.\n12\nTable of Contents\n9. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nDividends\nThe Company declared and paid cash dividends of $0.20 per common share during each of the first three quarters of 2024 and 2023, totaling $6.9 million in each\nnine month period. Declaration and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.\nStock Repurchases\nIn 2016, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the Company’s stock repurchase program first approved in 2015 from $15.0 million to $70.0 million. Any\nrepurchases will be made in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. For all or a portion of the authorized\nrepurchase amount, the Company may enter into one or more plans that are compliant with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act that are designed to facilitate these purchases.\nThe stock repurchase program does not require the Company to acquire a specific number of shares, and may be suspended from time to time or discontinued. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, $21.9 million of the $70.0 million stock repurchase program remained available for future purchases, inclusive of related estimated income tax.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component for the first nine months of 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\nForeign Currency Unrealized Gains\nTranslation (Losses) on Available-\nAdjustments For-Sale Investments Total\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ (1,057) $ (12) $ (1,069)\nOther comprehensive loss (114) (38) (152)\nBalance, March 31, 2024 (1,171) (50) (1,221)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) (36) 8 (28)\nBalance, June 30, 2024 (1,207) (42) (1,249)\nOther comprehensive income 252 37 289\nBalance, September 30, 2024 $ (955) $ (5) $ (960)\n10. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company is a party to a Royalty Agreement and License with Broady Health Sciences, L.L.C., a Texas limited liability company, (“BHS”) regarding the\nmanufacture and sale of a product called ReStor™. George K. Broady, a former director of the Company and beneficial owner of more than 5% of its outstanding common\nstock, is an indirect owner of BHS. Lucy Nduati, a director of the Company, has since 2013 served a number of companies controlled by George K. Broady and other\nBroady family members in a variety of roles focused on administration, accounting, finance, tax strategy and office management. Under this agreement (as amended), the\nCompany agreed to pay BHS a royalty based on a price per unit in return for the right to manufacture (or have manufactured), market, import, export and sell this product\nworldwide by or through multi-level marketing or network marketing. The Company recognized royalties of $8,000 and $11,000 during the three months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $27,000 and $33,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, under this agreement. The Company is\nnot required to purchase any product under the agreement, and the agreement may be terminated under certain circumstances with no notice. The agreement terminates\nMarch 31, 2025, after which it shall be automatically renewed for successive one-year terms unless notice is given by either party at least 90 days in advance of the\nexpiration of the then-current term.\n13\nTable of Contents\n11. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company sells products to a member network that operates in a seamless manner from market to market, except for the China market where it sells to some\nconsumers through an e-commerce platform, and the Russia and Kazakhstan market where the Company’s engagement of a third-party service provider results in a different\neconomic structure than its other markets. Otherwise, the Company believes that all of its other operating segments have similar economic characteristics and are similar in\nthe nature of the products sold, the product acquisition process, the types of customers products are sold to, the methods used to distribute the products, and the nature of the\nregulatory environment. Therefore, the Company aggregates its other operating segments (including its Hong Kong operating segment) into a single reporting segment (the\n“Primary Reporting Segment”).\nThe Company reviews its net sales and operating income (loss) by operating segment, and reviews its assets and capital expenditures on a consolidated basis and not\nby operating segment. As such, net sales and operating income (loss) are presented by reportable segment and assets and capital expenditures by operating segment are not\npresented. Segment operating income is adjusted for certain direct costs and commission allocation.\nThe Company’s operating information by geographic area are as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet sales:\nPrimary Reporting Segment $ 9,951 $ 10,249 $ 30,440 $ 31,719\nChina 601 254 1,321 917\nRussia and Kazakhstan 139 112 356 351\nTotal net sales $ 10,691 $ 10,615 $ 32,117 $ 32,987\nIncome (loss) from operations:\nPrimary Reporting Segment $ 1,511 $ 1,880 $ 4,847 $ 5,208\nChina 160 (160) (10) (423)\nRussia and Kazakhstan (31) (47) (88) (131)\nIncome from operations for reportable segments, net 1,640 1,673 4,749 4,654\nUnallocated corporate expenses (1,915) (1,965) (5,627) (6,083)\nOther income, net 441 585 1,523 1,708\nIncome before income taxes $ 166 $ 293 $ 645 $ 279\nThe Company’s net sales by geographic area are as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet sales from external customers:\nUnited States $ 274 $ 276 $ 799 $ 827\nCanada 134 180 387 507\nPeru 340 365 844 1,175\nHong Kong1 8,356 8,412 25,998 26,391\nChina 601 254 1,321 917\nTaiwan 454 552 1,277 1,460\nJapan 81 152 202 341\nMalaysia and Singapore 58 54 177 207\nRussia and Kazakhstan 139 112 356 351\nEurope 164 182 473 567\nOther foreign countries 90 76 283 244\nTotal net sales $ 10,691 $ 10,615 $ 32,117 $ 32,987\n1 Substantially all of the Company's Hong Kong revenues are derived from the sale of products that are delivered to members in China.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT\nOn October 28, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 on each share of common stock outstanding. The dividend will be payable\non November 22, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 12, 2024. The declaration and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole\ndiscretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.\n15\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness Overview\nWe are an international direct-selling and e-commerce company. Subsidiaries controlled by us sell personal care, wellness, and “quality of life” products under the\n“NHT Global” brand. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries have an active physical presence in the following markets: the Americas, which consists of the United States, Canada,\nCayman Islands, Mexico and Peru; Greater China, which consists of Hong Kong, Taiwan and China; Southeast Asia, which consists of Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand;\nSouth Korea; Japan; India; and Europe. We also operate in Russia and Kazakhstan through our engagement with a local service provider.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we were conducting business through 30,880 active members, compared to 32,410 at December 31, 2023 and 34,660 at September 30,\n2023. We consider a member “active” if they have placed at least one product order with us during the preceding year. Our priority is to focus our resources in our most\npromising markets, which we consider to be Greater China and countries where our existing members have the connections to recruit prospects and sell our products, such\nas Southeast Asia, India, South America and Europe.\nWe generate approximately 93% of our net sales from subsidiaries located outside the Americas, with sales of our Hong Kong subsidiary representing 78% of net\nsales in the latest fiscal quarter. Because of the size of our foreign operations, operating results can be impacted negatively or positively by factors such as foreign currency\nfluctuations, inflation rates, and economic, political and business conditions around the world. In addition, our business is subject to various laws and regulations, in\nparticular, regulations related to direct selling activities that create uncertain risks for our business, including improper claims or activities by our members and our potential\ninability to obtain necessary product registrations. We continually evaluate our business for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and this process can and has\nresulted in the identification of certain matters of potential noncompliance, which we work to satisfactorily address. For further information regarding some of the risks\nassociated with the conduct of our business in China and Hong Kong, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023, and more specifically under the captions “Because our Hong Kong operations account for a substantial portion of our overall business...”, “Our Hong Kong\noperations are being adversely affected by recent political and social developments in Hong Kong...”, and “Our business in China is subject to compliance with a myriad of\napplicable laws and regulations...”.\nChina has been and continues to be our most important business development project. We operate an e-commerce direct selling platform in Hong Kong that generates\nrevenue derived from the sale of products to members in Hong Kong and elsewhere, including China. Substantially all of our Hong Kong revenues are derived from the sale\nof products that are delivered to members in China. Through a separate Chinese entity, we operate an e-commerce retail platform in China. We believe that neither of these\nactivities require a direct selling license in China, which we do not currently hold. We previously submitted a preliminary application for a direct selling license in China,\nbut in 2019 a Chinese governmental authority recommended that we withdraw our application. We expect to reapply for a direct selling license in China when we believe\nthat circumstances are again ripe for doing so. If we are ultimately able to obtain a direct selling license in China, we believe that the incentives inherent in the direct selling\nmodel in China would incrementally benefit our existing business. We do not expect that any increased sales in China derived from obtaining a direct selling license would\ninitially be material and, in any event may be partially offset by the higher fixed costs associated with the establishment and maintenance of required service centers, branch\noffices, manufacturing facilities, certification programs and other legal requirements. We are unable to predict whether and when we will be successful in obtaining a direct\nselling license to operate in China, and if we are successful, when we will be permitted to conduct direct selling operations and whether such operations would be profitable.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIn January 2019 the Chinese government announced a 100-day campaign focused on companies involved in the sale of food, equipment, daily necessities, small\nhome electrical appliances and services that are claimed to promote health. The Chinese government ministries in charge of this campaign indicated that they were targeting\nillegal practices in the industry, particularly the manufacture and sale of counterfeit and substandard products, and false advertising and misleading claims as to the health\nbenefits of products and services. It is understood that the campaign was specifically focused on the business practices of direct selling companies. The campaign and\nassociated negative media coverage resulted in a significant adverse impact on our business, as consumers widely curtailed their purchases within the affected industries.\nWe, like some of our peers, voluntarily decided in January 2019 to temporarily suspend our member activities, such as product roadshows, product trainings and larger\ncompany-sponsored events, in China. We did this because we learned that the 100-day campaign was announced in broad outlines by the central government, and the\ninterpretation and enforcement of the campaign was delegated to the provincial and local governments. We consider it a top priority for our business to develop an\nunderstanding of and cooperate with all levels and jurisdictions of the government agencies, and did not want to run the risk of being inadvertently entangled in government\nenforcement actions as the provincial and local governments formulate and implement their interpretive guidance and rule-making. Although we have been able to relax\nsome restrictions on member activities in certain markets, it may again in the future be necessary or advisable to suspend member activities or take similar actions from time\nto time, and such periods of reduced activity may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough the 100-day campaign was due to expire in April 2019, we are not aware of any information indicating that the campaign has formally concluded. However,\nthe Chinese government subsequently announced that it would conduct a “look-back review” to evaluate the 100-day campaign. As part of this review, we understand that\nvarious Chinese governmental agencies formed a working group to assess the 100-day campaign, particularly focusing on the health market and its supervision in certain\nprovinces. We understand that during September 2019 the working group evaluated the performance and results of a number of organizations and governmental departments\nin these provinces and made recommendations for various improvements. It was noted that each province had opened a number of investigative cases, had successfully\nclosed numerous cases, and had imposed various fines and penalties. We understand that the look-back review continued after September 2019, and we are not aware that\nthis review has been completed. As a result, the business environment in China for health product companies continues to be challenging, which has been exacerbated by\nnegative social media sentiment expressed for these types of companies. We believe that the campaign, as well as its extension and aftermath (including the look-back\nreview), will continue to negatively impact our business in China in the near-term, but will ultimately benefit us and Chinese consumers in the long-term as purveyors of\nsubstandard products are driven from the market.\nIn late 2019 or early 2020 an outbreak of COVID-19 was first identified in China and subsequently spread around the world. On March 11, 2020 the World Health\nOrganization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The outbreak caused the Chinese government to implement powerful measures to control the virus, such\nas requiring businesses to close throughout various areas of China and restricting public gatherings and certain travel within the country. We have significant business in\nChina and in 2023 generated approximately 79% of our revenue in Hong Kong, substantially all of which was derived from the sale of products to members in China. Over\nthe course of the pandemic, we took steps to adapt some of our marketing programs, such as relying on certain product promotions and webcast training, to overcome the\nphysical restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic. In late 2022, the Chinese and Hong Kong governments took comprehensive steps to relax many of their COVID-\n19 control measures, although the cumulative effect of the disruptions associated with the pandemic materially negatively impacted our financial results from 2020 through\n2022. This less restrictive business environment in China and Hong Kong continued throughout 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, and we have been able to sponsor\nin-person member events in China, Hong Kong and/or Macau during each quarter since the first quarter of 2023. We are continuing to plan and sponsor more such events\nconsistent with normal operations. Nevertheless, it may be too early to accurately predict the impact on us and our third-party providers of this relaxation of control\nmeasures and whether it will prove enduring. Ultimately, the severity of the impact on us of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, including the\nduration and spread of the virus, and the related control measures, which we are unable to accurately predict. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Epidemics, such as the COVID-\n19 pandemic, or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war…” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent political and social developments in Hong Kong, along with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government control measures, are also\nadversely affecting our Hong Kong operations and led us in 2020 to cease sponsoring member meetings and events in Hong Kong. Inasmuch as member meetings and\nevents located in Hong Kong have in the past served as an important component of our product marketing and distribution efforts, we believe that these developments\nnegatively affected our past operations and financial performance. Although we have been able to sponsor in-person member events in Hong Kong in recent quarters, it may\nbe too early to predict whether these developments will continue to adversely affect our overall business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Item 1A. Risk\nFactors - Our Hong Kong operations are being adversely affected by recent political and social developments in Hong Kong...” in our most recent Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\n17\nTable of Contents\nStatement of Operations Presentation\nWe mainly derive revenue from sales of products. Substantially all of our product sales are to independent members at published wholesale prices. Product sales are\nrecognized when the products are shipped and title passes to independent members, which generally is upon our delivery to the carrier that completes delivery to the\nmembers. We estimate and accrue a reserve for product returns based on our return policies and historical experience. We bill members for shipping charges and recognize\nthe freight revenue in net sales. We have elected to account for shipping and handling activities performed after title has passed to members as a fulfillment cost, and accrue\nfor the costs of shipping and handling if revenue is recognized before the contractually obligated shipping and handling activities occurs. Event and training revenue is\ndeferred and recognized as the event or training occurs.\nCost of sales consists primarily of products purchased from third-party manufacturers, freight cost for transporting products to our foreign subsidiaries and shipping\nproducts to members, import duties, packing materials, product royalties, costs of promotional materials sold to our members at or near cost, and provisions for slow\nmoving or obsolete inventories. Cost of sales also includes purchasing costs, receiving costs, inspection costs and warehousing costs.\nMember commissions are our most significant expense and are classified as an operating expense. Under our compensation plan, members are paid weekly\ncommissions by our subsidiary in which they are enrolled, generally in their home country currency, for product purchases by their down-line member network across all\ngeographic markets. Our China subsidiary maintains an e-commerce retail platform and does not pay commissions, although our Chinese members may participate in our\ncompensation plan through our other subsidiaries. This “seamless” compensation plan enables a member located in one country to enroll other members located in other\ncountries where we are authorized to conduct our business. Currently, there are basically two ways in which our members can earn income:\n• through commissions paid on the accumulated bonus volume from product purchases made by their down-line members and customers; and\n• through retail profits on sales of products purchased by members at wholesale prices and resold at retail prices (for purchasers in some of our smaller markets and\npurchasers from our China subsidiary, sales are for personal consumption only and income may not be earned through retail profits).\nEach of our products is designated a specified number of bonus volume points. Commissions are based on total personal and group bonus volume points per weekly\nsales period. Bonus volume points are essentially a percentage of a product’s wholesale price. As the member’s business expands from successfully enrolling other members\nwho in turn expand their own businesses by selling product to other members, the member receives higher commissions from purchases made by an expanding down-line\nnetwork. In some of our markets, to be eligible to receive commissions, a member may be required to make nominal monthly or other periodic purchases of our products.\nCertain of our subsidiaries do not require these nominal purchases for a member to be eligible to receive commissions. In determining commissions, the number of levels of\ndown-line members included within the member’s commissionable group increases as the number of memberships directly below the member increases.\n18\nTable of Contents\nUnder our current compensation plan, certain of our commission payouts may be limited to a hard cap dollar amount per week or a specific percentage of total\nproduct sales. In some markets, commissions may be further limited. In some markets, we also pay certain bonuses on purchases by up to three generations of personally\nsponsored members, as well as bonuses on commissions earned by up to seven generations of personally sponsored members. Members can also earn additional income,\ntrips and other prizes in specific time-limited promotions and contests we hold from time to time. Member commissions are dependent on the sales mix and, for the first\nnine months of 2024 and 2023, represented 41% and 42% of net sales, respectively. Occasionally, we make modifications and enhancements to our compensation plan to\nhelp motivate members, which can have an impact on member commissions. We may also enter into performance-based agreements for business or market development,\nwhich can result in additional compensation to specific members.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of administrative compensation and benefits, travel, credit card fees and assessments, professional fees, certain\noccupancy costs, and other corporate administrative expenses (including stock-based compensation). In addition, this category includes selling, marketing, and promotion\nexpenses (including the costs of member training events and conventions that are designed to increase both product awareness and member recruitment). Because our\nvarious member conventions are not always held at the same time each year, interim period comparisons will be impacted accordingly.\nThe functional currency of our international subsidiaries is generally their local currency. Local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange\non the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the period. Equity accounts are translated at historical\nrates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly into stockholders’ equity.\nSales by our foreign subsidiaries are generally transacted in the respective local currencies and are translated into U.S. dollars using average rates of exchange for\neach monthly accounting period to which they relate. Most of our product purchases from third-party manufacturers are transacted in U.S. dollars. Consequently, our sales\nand net earnings are affected by changes in currency exchange rates, with sales and earnings generally increasing with a weakening U.S. dollar and decreasing with a\nstrengthening U.S. dollar.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our operating results as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%\nCost of sales 25.9 25.3 26.1 25.4\nGross profit 74.1 74.7 73.9 74.6\nOperating expenses:\nCommissions expense 40.5 41.1 40.5 42.0\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 36.2 36.3 36.1 36.9\nTotal operating expenses 76.7 77.4 76.6 78.9\nLoss from operations (2.6) (2.7) (2.7) (4.3)\nOther income, net 4.1 5.5 4.7 5.2\nIncome before income taxes 1.5 2.8 2.0 0.9\nIncome tax provision 1.2 1.2 0.8 0.2\nNet income 0.3% 1.6% 1.2% 0.7%\n19\nTable of Contents\nNet Sales\nThe following table sets forth revenue by market for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAmericas1 $ 748 7.0% $ 821 7.8% $ 2,030 6.3% $ 2,509 7.6%\nHong Kong2 8,356 78.2 8,412 79.2 25,998 80.9 26,391 80.0\nChina 601 5.6 254 2.4 1,321 4.1 917 2.8\nTaiwan 454 4.2 552 5.2 1,277 4.0 1,460 4.4\nSouth Korea 31 0.3 34 0.3 122 0.4 124 0.4\nJapan 81 0.8 152 1.4 202 0.6 341 1.0\nMalaysia and Singapore 58 0.5 54 0.5 177 0.6 207 0.6\nRussia and Kazakhstan 139 1.3 112 1.1 356 1.1 351 1.1\nEurope 164 1.5 182 1.7 473 1.5 567 1.7\nIndia 59 0.6 42 0.4 161 0.5 120 0.4\nTotal $ 10,691 100.0% $ 10,615 100.0% $ 32,117 100.0% $ 32,987 100.0%\n1 United States, Canada, Mexico and Peru\n2 Substantially all of our Hong Kong revenues are derived from the sale of products that are delivered to members in China. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our most recent\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nNet sales were $10.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with $10.6 million for the comparable period a year ago, an increase of\n$76,000, or 1%. Hong Kong net sales, substantially all of which were derived from the sale of products shipped to members residing in China, were almost the same for\neach of the three-month periods, decreasing $56,000, or less than 1%, over the comparable period a year ago. Outside of our Hong Kong business, net sales increased\n$132,000, or 6%, over the comparable three-month period a year ago, primarily due to the increased quarter-over-quarter net sales in our Chinese e-commerce retail\nbusiness.\nNet sales were $32.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with $33.0 million for the comparable period a year ago, a decrease of\n$870,000, or 3%. Hong Kong net sales, substantially all of which were derived from the sale of products shipped to members residing in China, were almost the same for\neach of the nine-month periods, decreasing $393,000, or 1%, over the comparable period a year ago. Hong Kong net sales were also adversely affected by the recognition of\nlower administrative fees in the current-year period, as compared to the prior-year period last year, as increased activity within member electronic wallet (eWallet) accounts\nresulted in less fees assessed during the current-year period. Outside of our Hong Kong business, net sales decreased $477,000, or 7%, over the comparable nine-month\nperiod a year ago, primarily due to the decreased period-over-period net sales in our business in the Americas (which was somewhat offset by increased period-over-period\nnet sales in our Chinese e-commerce retail business). As of September 30, 2024, deferred revenue was $6.8 million, which consisted of $5.2 million pertaining to unshipped\nproduct orders and unredeemed product vouchers, as well as $1.6 million in auto ship advances.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was 74.1% of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 74.7% of net sales for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. Gross profit was 73.9% of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 74.6% of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe decline in gross profit margin for both the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to higher costs related to our Premium\nNoni Juice product.\nCommissions Expense\nCommissions were 40.5% of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 41.1% of net sales for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. Commissions were 40.5% of net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 42.0% of net sales for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The decline in commissions as a percentage of net sales during both the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to lower weekly\ncommissions earned outside of our Hong Kong business.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $3.9 million for each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Selling, general and\nadministrative expenses decreased to $11.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $12.2 million in the same period a year ago. The\ndecrease for the nine-month period was primarily due to lower professional fees and insurance expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net\nsales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 were roughly the same as the comparable period in the prior year and were modestly lower for the nine-month\nperiod ended September 30, 2024 than the same period a year ago.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income was $441,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with $585,000 in the same period a year ago. Other income was $1.5 million\nand $1.7 million for each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease for both the three- and nine-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was primarily due to less interest income earned during each of the current year periods.\n20\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nAn income tax provision of $131,000 and $121,000 were recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. An income tax\nprovision of $249,000 and $69,000 were recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The tax provision during each of the three-\nand nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily resulted from foreign income inclusions, such as global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) and\nSubpart F income, tax benefits in foreign jurisdictions and year-to-date consolidated income through September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $46.3 million. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased\nby $9.9 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 due to the dividends paid during the first nine months of 2024 and the payment of the repatriation tax on\nthe deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income as required by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three\nmonths or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, we had $37.9 million in available-for-sale investments classified as either cash\nequivalents or marketable securities. In addition, cash and cash equivalents included $3.8 million held in banks located within China subject to foreign currency controls.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.6 to 1.0 and we had $32.7 million of working capital. Working capital as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 decreased $11.5 million compared to our working capital as of December 31, 2023.\nCash used in operations was $3.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared with $4.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. Income tax paid during April\n2024 and April 2023 for the repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income was $4.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively. Disregarding these\npayments, cash flows from operations improved $1.7 million primarily due to improved management of inventories and operating costs during the first nine months of 2024\nas compared to the same period last year, as well as a timing difference related to weekly commission outflows.\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $23.1 million and $32,000 during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the first nine months of\n2024, we purchased $44.8 million in marketable securities with original maturities greater than three months, and as such, reflect these purchases as an investing activity.\nThese purchases of marketable securities were offset by $21.8 million of proceeds received from maturities of marketable securities.\nCash flows used in financing activities during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 consisted solely of quarterly dividend payments of $0.20 per common share,\ntotaling $6.9 million in each period. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, on October 28, 2024, the Board of Directors declared another quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 on\neach share of common stock outstanding. The dividend will be payable on November 22, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 12, 2024. We expect to continue\npaying a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 on each share of common stock outstanding for the foreseeable future. However, any future cash dividends will be at the sole\ndiscretion of the Company’s Board of Directors, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors considered relevant\nby the Board of Directors.\nIn 2016, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the Company’s stock repurchase program first approved in 2015 from $15.0 million to $70.0 million. Any\nrepurchases will be made in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. For all or a portion of the authorized\nrepurchase amount, the Company may enter into one or more plans that are compliant with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act that are designed to facilitate these purchases.\nThe stock repurchase program does not require the Company to acquire a specific number of shares, and may be suspended from time to time or discontinued. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, $21.9 million of the $70.0 million stock repurchase program remained available for future purchases, inclusive of related estimated income tax.\nWe believe that our existing internal liquidity, supported by cash on hand and cash flows from operations, should be adequate to fund normal business operations and\naddress our financial commitments for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not have any significant unused sources of liquid assets. If necessary, we may attempt to generate more funding from the capital markets, but currently we do\nnot believe that will be necessary.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOur priority is to focus our resources on investing in our most important markets, which we consider to be Greater China and countries where our existing members\nmay have the connections to recruit prospects and sell our products, such as Southeast Asia, India, South America and Europe. We will continue to invest in our Mainland\nChina entity for such purposes as establishing China-based manufacturing capabilities, increasing public awareness of our brand and our products, sourcing more Chinese-\nmade products, building a chain of service stations, opening additional Healthy Lifestyle Centers or branch offices, adding local staffing and other requirements for a\nprospective China direct selling license application.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require our management to make estimates\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates, as well as the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting periods. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of\noperations would be affected. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our\ncircumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time\nthe accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably\ncould have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. There are items within our financial statements that\nrequire estimation but are not deemed critical, as defined above.\nFor a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies and related judgments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on\nFebruary 28, 2024.\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable under smaller reporting company disclosure rules.\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement, with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and\noperation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as\nof September 30, 2024. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports\nthat it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange\nCommission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and\nprincipal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.\n22\nTable of Contents\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.
