Net cash used in operating activities during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was €5.7 million, compared to €7.5 million used for the same period last year. During the first three quarters of 2024, the Company achieved certain milestones in the collaboration agreement with Eli Lilly amounting to $5.5 million. In October, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of 18,000,000 ordinary shares and a concurrent private placement of 3,523,538 ordinary shares with Eli Lilly, as well as exercise of the underwriter’s option for 1,940,072 additional shares for gross proceeds totaling approximately $82.1 million.\n\nResearch and development (R&D) costs were €9.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to €5.4 million for the same period last year.\n\nGeneral and administrative costs were €3.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 in line with €3.3 million for the same period last year.\n\nNet loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was €8.1 million, or €0.10 per diluted share, compared to €5.4 million, or €0.07 per diluted share, for the same period last year. For further financial information for the period ended September 30, 2024, please refer to the Q3 financial report filing.\n\n**About Axiomer****™**\n\nProQR is pioneering a next-generation RNA base editing technology called Axiomer™, which could potentially yield a new class of medicines for diverse types of diseases. Axiomer™ “Editing Oligonucleotides”, or EONs, mediate single nucleotide changes to RNA in a highly specific and targeted way using molecular machinery that is present in human cells called ADAR (Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA). Axiomer™ EONs are designed to recruit and direct endogenously expressed ADARs to change an Adenosine (A) to an Inosine (I) in the RNA – an Inosine is translated as a Guanosine (G) – correcting an RNA with a disease-causing mutation back to a normal (wild type) RNA, modulating protein expression, or altering a protein so that it will have a new function that helps prevent or treat disease. \n\n**About Biliary Atresia (BA) and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)**\n\nCholestatic disorders refer to a group of diseases presenting excessive and toxic buildup of bile acids in the liver due to bile ducts dysfunction. This leads to liver damage and a range of debilitating symptoms. Without treatment, liver damage can progress through various stages, ultimately leading to liver failure and elevated risk of liver malignancy, affecting life expectancy. Cholestatic diseases remain leading causes of liver transplantation. There are no approved therapies for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) for adults and biliary atresia (BA) for pediatrics. It is estimated that 80,000 and 20,000 individuals have PSC and BA, respectively, in North America and in Europe. \n\n**About AX-0810 targeting NTCP**\n\nThe majority of the bile acids present in the liver cells originate from the enterohepatic reuptake cycle. The key transporter responsible for hepatic uptake of bile acids from portal circulation is the sodium (Na+)-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP, SLC10A1 gene) expressed in the liver. AX-0810 is designed to introduce a loss of function variant in SLC10A1 RNA that has been found in human genetics to prevent re-uptake of bile acids in liver via NTCP. Based on its mechanism of action, AX-0810 has the potential to become a disease modifying treatment for PSC and BA primarily among other cholestatic diseases.\n\n**About Cardiovascular Diseases**\n\nCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of health conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as atherosclerosis which can lead to severe problems like heart attacks, heart failure, and stroke. CVDs represent the leading cause of disability and death in the world. Approximately 18 million people die every year from CVDs representing one third of all the global deaths. Despite available lipid lowering therapies and hypertension medications, the risk of CVDs is still projected to increase rapidly over the coming years.\n\n**About AX-1412 targeting B4GALT1**\n\nGene–based analysis of rare beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (_B4GALT1_) missense variant (p.Asn352Ser) is known to lead to B4GALT1 protein loss of function and showed an association with decreased coronary artery disease. These beneficial effects are mediated by hypo-galactosylation of the apolipoprotein B100 and fibrinogen, known – independent – drivers of increased risk of CVDs. AX-1412 introduces a protective variant into _B4GALT1_ RNA to address the remaining residual risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. ProQR intends to advance AX-1412 targeting B4GALT1 to early clinical proof of concept stage, then would seek to partner this program.\n\n**About ProQR**\n\nProQR Therapeutics is dedicated to changing lives through the creation of transformative RNA therapies. ProQR is pioneering a next-generation RNA technology called Axiomer™, which uses a cell’s own editing machinery called ADAR to make specific single nucleotide edits in RNA to reverse a mutation or modulate protein expression and could potentially yield a new class of medicines for both rare and prevalent diseases with unmet need. Based on our unique proprietary RNA repair platform technologies we are growing our pipeline with patients and loved ones in mind.\n\nLearn more about ProQR at [External link**www.proqr.com** (external link)](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-mwDHiLffoHsTfxR24HufOEK9OmDrWxURS9JzC8-d7760UhE-d6V-QTsHBjZBCdDVd3wnQgYOSFYt3STYu-LTQ==).\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.

(Nasdaq: PRQR) (“ProQR”), a company dedicated to changing lives through transformative RNA therapies based on its proprietary Axiomer™ RNA editing technology platform, today announced the closing of its previously announced underwritten public offering of 18,000,000 ordinary shares (the “Offering”) at a public offering price of $3.50 per share, for total gross proceeds of $63.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by ProQR.

(Nasdaq: PRQR) (“ProQR”), a company dedicated to changing lives through transformative RNA therapies based on its proprietary Axiomer™ RNA editing technology platform, today announced the pricing of its previously announced underwritten public offering of 18,000,000 ordinary shares (the “Offering”) at a public offering price of $3.50 per share, for total gross proceeds of $63.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by ProQR. All of the shares are being offered by ProQR. In addition, ProQR has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 2,700,000 additional ordinary shares at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions.\n\nConcurrently with the Offering, ProQR has entered into a share purchase agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”), one of its existing shareholders and a strategic partner of ProQR, in a separately negotiated transaction pursuant to which ProQR agreed to offer and sell, and Lilly agreed to purchase, 3,523,538 ordinary shares to permit Lilly to maintain its current pro rata beneficial ownership (16.4%) of the number of the ordinary shares to be outstanding immediately following the closing of the Offering and the concurrent private placement (without giving effect to any exercise by the underwriters of the option to purchase additional shares), at a price per share equal to the public offering price for total gross proceeds of approximately $12.3 million, subject to a purchase price cap of $15.0 million, the consummation of the Offering and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The sale of the ordinary shares to Lilly in the concurrent private placement will not be registered as part of the Offering. The Offering is not contingent upon the completion of the concurrent private placement. The ordinary shares purchased in the concurrent private placement will not be subject to any underwriting discounts or commissions.\n\nThe ordinary shares to be sold in the concurrent private placement are being issued pursuant to the exemptions provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). These shares have not been registered under the Securities Act, or any state or other applicable jurisdiction’s securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state or other jurisdiction’s securities laws. \n\nProQR currently intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering and the concurrent private placement, together with its existing cash and cash equivalents, to primarily fund research and development and clinical development to support the advancement of its current or future product candidates and the expansion of its research and development programs, and the remainder for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.\n\nEvercore ISI, Cantor, Raymond James and Oppenheimer & Co. are acting as joint lead bookrunning managers for the Offering. The Offering and concurrent private placement are expected to close on October 24, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\n\nA shelf registration statement on Form F-3 relating to the Offering (including the accompanying prospectus) was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 30, 2024 and was declared effective on October 10, 2024. The Offering is being made only by means of a prospectus and prospectus supplement that form a part of the registration statement. A preliminary prospectus supplement relating to and describing the terms of the Offering has been filed with the SEC and may be obtained for free by visiting the SEC’s website at [External linkwww.sec.gov (external link)](http://www.sec.gov). A final prospectus supplement relating to the Offering will be filed with the SEC. When available, copies of the final prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus relating to the Offering may be obtained from: Evercore Group L.L.C., Attention: Equity Capital Markets, 55 East 52nd Street, 35th Floor, New York, New York 10055, by telephone at (888) 474-0200 or by email at Internal linkecm.prospectus@evercore.com; or Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Attention: Capital Markets, 110 East 59th Street, 6th Floor, New York, New York 10022 or by email at Internal linkprospectus@cantor.com.
