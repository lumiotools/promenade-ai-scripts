Reports Third Quarter Results\n\nCompany Release - 10/28/2024\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\n_Increase in Core Deposits, a High-Quality Loan Portfolio and Strong Capital_\n\nFAIRFAX, Va., Oct. 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MainStreet Bancshares, Inc. (Nasdaq: MNSB & MNSBP), the financial holding company for MainStreet Bank, reported a loss of -$0.04 per common share for the third quarter of 2024 as it dealt decisively with a small number of nonperforming real estate loans. Year-to-date 2024 earnings per common share are $0.60. The Company remains strongly capitalized.\n\n[ ![MainStreet Bancshares, Inc. Logo](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/458615/MainStreet_Bancshares_2024_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/458615/MainStreet_Bancshares_2024_Logo.html)\n\n\"Our third quarter annualized net interest margin was impacted by $984,000 in accrued interest income that was reversed in relation to loans placed on nonaccrual status,\" said Alex Vari, Chief Accountant for MainStreet Bank. \"This resulted in a quarterly net interest margin of 3.05% and a year-to-date net interest margin of 3.19%.\" \n\nThe Company charged off $1.9 million of nonperforming loans during the quarter and allocated $1 million to provision expense to augment loan growth and ensure the Allowance for Credit Losses remains directionally consistent for the purposes of growth and quality.\n\nIn response to the bank's credit quality, Chris Johnston, Chief Credit Officer for MainStreet Bank, expanded, \"this quarter showed the underlying strength of a portfolio shaped by a rigorous credit culture. The total principal losses incurred year-to-date 2024 approximates just 0.1% of total loans. Our lending team has demonstrated great resolve in addressing troubled loans, both by working with borrowers and by finding acceptable solutions minimizing the impact on shareholder value. With that, we expect the level of problem loans to improve from this point.\"\n\nTotal deposits expanded to $1.9 billion. The Bank continues to attract healthy amounts of core deposits, reaching $1.47 billion, or 78% of total deposits. \n\n\"The DC Metropolitan area is a vibrant market. Our Business Bankers continue to perform, growing noninterest bearing core deposits by $33 million during the quarter,\" noted Abdul Hersiburane, President of MainStreet Bank. \"In an exercise of foresight, we structured noncore deposits with immediate rate repricing or callable options. We have now $233 million of our $423 million noncore deposits available to reprice as rates fall.\"\n\nIn 2021, the Board and management decided to make an investment in technology that would best serve clients requiring Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS). The Avenu BaaS solution officially launched just prior to the end of the third quarter of 2024. The ability to digitally offer banking services in a safe and compliant manner allows the Company to reach new customer deposit segments, diversify revenue streams and generate additional income. The BaaS market is currently underserved, and the opportunities for a well-developed solution are robust. The Avenu business model is in-line with the Company's physical branch-lite strategy.\n\n\"Avenu provides a full-stack embedded banking solution that connects our partners and their apps directly and seamlessly to our purpose-built Avenu core,\" said Jeff W. Dick, Chairman & CEO of MainStreet Bancshares, Inc. and MainStreet Bank. \"With Version 1 of Avenu placed in-service, the team is focused on getting the first fintech to general release in early November, and another four fintechs to follow soon thereafter. Just as with any business expansion opportunity, the expenses associated with launching Avenu will impact profitability until we reach break-even. However, after that point Avenu's ability to digitally scale can far surpass bricks and mortar growth and profitability.\"\n\nAvenu's clients are fintechs, social media solutions, application developers, money movers, and entrepreneurs. They all have one thing in common: They are in search of a reliable partner to help innovate how money moves - solving real-world issues and helping communities thrive. MainStreet Bank is that reliable partner dedicated to providing a best-in-class solution to sustain long-term business relationships.\n\n**ABOUT MAINSTREET BANK:** MainStreet operates six branches in Herndon, Fairfax, McLean, Leesburg, Clarendon, and Washington, D.C.

Reports a Profitable Second Quarter\n\nCompany Release - 7/29/2024\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\n_Rise in Core Deposits Fueled an Uptick in Loan Growth_\n\nFAIRFAX, Va., July 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MainStreet Bancshares, Inc. (Nasdaq: MNSB & MNSBP), the holding company for MainStreet Bank, reported net income of $2.6 million for the second quarter of 2024.\n\n[ ![MainStreet Bancshares, Inc. Logo](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/458615/MainStreet_Bancshares_2024_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/458615/MainStreet_Bancshares_2024_Logo.html)\n\nTotal deposits reached $1.8 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 10.2% from the second quarter of 2023. Loan growth is up 8.6% over the same period, also reaching $1.8 billion.\n\n\"We are now nine full quarters into the current interest rate cycle, and the entire industry has felt the effect of higher deposit costs. I'm happy to report that we experienced the softest impact this quarter, with our net interest margin settling in at a healthy 3.15%,\" said Jeff W. Dick, Chairman and CEO of MainStreet Bancshares, Inc. and MainStreet Bank. \"We see signs of an improving net interest margin going forward, but FOMC actions or other unforeseen externalities could affect momentum. Externalities aside, as our strategic initiatives start to bear fruit, we are confident and optimistic that the trail we have blazed to offer Banking as a Service (BaaS) will positively affect our net interest margin and our bottom line.\"\n\n\"We remain focused on caring for our customers and meeting their continuing banking and borrowing needs while judiciously adding promising new relationships,\" said Abdul Hersiburane, President of MainStreet Bank. \"We've built our core customer funding sources up to 78% of total deposits.\"\n\nLoan growth in the second quarter was driven by a healthy rise in demand for commercial and industrial borrowing and in high-quality owner-occupied commercial real estate lending, a traditional area of strength for MainStreet Bank.\n\nThe Bank maintains a strong portfolio of earning assets, with very nominal AOCI exposure. The loan portfolio remains solid with net charge offs representing a mere eight basis points of average gross loans. Nonperforming assets account for 0.99% of total assets.\n\n\"We continue to carefully underwrite each loan opportunity and the lending team remains engaged with each borrower throughout their project lifecycle. If a borrower experiences a challenge, we work with them to face that challenge promptly and transparently,\" said Tom Floyd, EVP and Chief Lending Officer at MainStreet Bank. \"We have a meticulous understanding of our loan book and a rigorous risk management mindset.\"\n\n**Banking-as-a-Service** In recent months, the weaknesses of other embedded banking solutions have been exposed—to the detriment of banks, their fintech clients and their end-customers. The Avenu team digested all the lessons that could be learned from these weaknesses and is implementing final enhancements to ensure a scalable and compliance-rich solution. Avenu is live and in limited production until the final enhancements are fully integrated.\n\n**Avenu** Avenu is the first and only embedded banking solution that connects our partners and their apps directly and seamlessly to our purpose-built Avenu core solution. We are not a sponsor bank without our own technology, and we are not a middleware software company without our own bank. We are Avenu, a leading financial technology company owned by an established community bank in the heart of Washington, D.C.\n\nAvenu's clients are fintechs, social media, application developers, money movers, and entrepreneurs. They all have one thing in common: They are innovating how money moves to solve real-world issues and help communities thrive. We are focused on servicing our community and creating long-term business relationships.\n\n**ABOUT MAINSTREET BANK:** MainStreet operates six branches in Herndon, Fairfax, McLean, Leesburg, Clarendon, and Washington, D.C.

Their stories are told in the magazine's June 2024 issue.\n\nFloyd, who is 39, oversees a team of seasoned lenders and a $1.7 billion loan portfolio. He has played a critical role in positioning the bank and its clients to navigate changing interest rate dynamics.\n\n\"I'm proud to be a community banker and to have the opportunity to provide the loans that help the people and businesses of the Greater Washington community to grow and thrive,\" said Floyd, who joined MainStreet Bank in 2017. \"I'm fortunate to have an exceptionally dedicated and hard-working team. And it's humbling to find myself in such great company with bankers from across the nation.\"\n\nIn the current environment, Floyd has guided his team in growing loans prudently while sustaining strong customer relationships. \"Customer engagement is always important, but never more so than in a shifting economic environment,\" he said. \"Understanding your customers is the key to long-term relationships, and meticulously managing the loan portfolio is absolutely critical.\"\n\n\"Tom is a tremendous asset to MainStreet Bank, and he is an inspired pacesetter for the lending team, which he leads with discipline and drive,\" said Jeff W. Dick, Chairman and CEO of MainStreet Bank and its parent company. \"We are thrilled to see him gaining peer recognition for his achievements.\"\n\n\"Tom is a banker who is always thinking several steps ahead, anticipating what the dynamics of the economy mean for his customers and the bank, and devising solutions,\" said Abdul Hersiburane, President of MainStreet Bank.
