The winning submission from KRAFT’s recent “Fan Flavorites” program, KRAFT Mac & Cheese Everything Bagel flavor will be available exclusively at Walmart.com, while supplies last. Nationwide pre-sale will begin November 25. The launch underscores a new, flavor-focused innovation strategy KRAFT is piloting over the next year. \n\nThis press release features multimedia.

From bagels and schmear to breakfast sandwiches, everything bagels and cheese have long been a dynamic duo. The versatile and savory seasoning enhances the cheese’s mellow, buttery taste, creating the perfect bite. For the first time, KRAFT is bringing the beloved breakfast pairing to the mac & cheese aisle. \n\n“As a consumer-obsessed brand, our goal is to introduce new products that deliver on what our fans are craving,” says Sara Roashan, Associate Director of Innovation for KRAFT Mac & Cheese. “Last year, we launched a contest to give fans a forum to share what flavors they would want to see from us. After receiving hundreds of requests for an Everything Bagel flavor, we’re thrilled to officially introduce it to the world.” \n\nAs consumers are looking for bolder, more exciting flavor offerings, KRAFT is piloting a new flavor-focused expansion strategy.3 Leveraging market and social media trends, consumer feedback, and fan suggestions, KRAFT is bringing unexpected and crave-worthy new flavors to market in record time – in fact, the brand is currently testing more than 60 potential new flavors. Over the next year, the beloved mac & cheese brand will release several new flavors via ultra-exclusive, small batch e-commerce drops, limited-edition in-store products, and/or permanent portfolio additions. \n\nEverything Bagel marks the first small batch drop for the brand – releasing fewer than 15,000 boxes nationwide, which is less than two percent of the number of boxes of Original KRAFT Mac & Cheese the brand sells each day.4 Fans can [order KRAFT Mac & Cheese Everything Bagel exclusively on Walmart.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.avanan.click%2Fv2%2F___https%3A%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FKRAFT-DINNERS-DRY%2F12726866497___.YXAzOmFibWM6YTpvOjcxYjQ0YzMxZmE3OTA4MzdmNDRmZTg0ZTM0ODAwMTkzOjY6YTk1MzphODc2YTlkZDhlYmNkNDBhOTAzNmNjNDI0NzI2YzVmMDI4OGYyOTg0NTkxMzNlMDZkOWE1MGQ4MjgzMzAzZGFmOnA6RjpO&esheet=54155358&newsitemid=20241120660032&lan=en-US&anchor=order+KRAFT+Mac+%26amp%3B+Cheese+Everything+Bagel+exclusively+on+Walmart.com&index=1&md5=24025456f48414f6b7c56401dd1d18be) for an SRP of $1.58.

When we look at our U.S. Retail business, we are expecting more of an elongated recovery, driven by specific categories that continue to experience pressure.” \n\n“We continue to make investments in marketing, research and development, and technology as we look to bring solutions to the table that both create value for our consumers and support future top-line growth. We are supporting these investments by our proven ability to sustainably unlock efficiencies and generate strong cash flow.” \n\nAbrams-Rivera continued, “While a recovery is taking longer than originally anticipated, we are not losing sight of our long-term strategy.

Price increased 1.2 percentage points versus the prior year period, with increases in the North America and Emerging Markets segments partially offset by lower price in International Developed Markets. Favorable price was primarily due to pricing taken in certain categories to mitigate higher input costs. Volume/mix declined 3.4 percentage points versus the prior year period, with declines in the North America and International Developed Markets segments partially offset by volume/mix growth in Emerging Markets. Unfavorable volume/mix was primarily driven by continued shifts in consumer behavior due to economic uncertainty and a decline in _Lunchables_. \n\n\n  * **Operating Income** decreased 115.5 percent versus the year-ago period to $(0.1) billion, as a result of non-cash impairment losses of $1.4 billion in the current year period. This impairment charge was due to an intangible asset impairment largely on the _Lunchables_ brand and a goodwill impairment related to the Continental Europe reporting unit. Excluding the impact of these non-cash impairment losses, operating income increased $12 million due to factors noted in Adjusted Operating Income. **Adjusted Operating Income(1) **increased 1.4 percent versus the year-ago period to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by higher pricing, the beneficial impact from our efficiency initiatives mostly in procurement, and lower variable compensation expense. These factors more than offset unfavorable volume/mix, increased manufacturing expenses due in part to increased labor costs, and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency (0.2 pp). \n\n\n  * **Diluted EPS** decreased 214.3 percent versus the prior year period to $(0.24), driven by non-cash impairment losses in the current year period. **Adjusted EPS(1)** was $0.75, up 4.2 percent versus the prior year period, primarily driven by higher Adjusted Operating Income, fewer shares outstanding, and lower taxes on adjusted earnings. \n\n\n  * Year-to-date**net cash provided by/(used for) operating activities** was $2.8 billion, up 6.7 percent versus the year-ago period. This increase was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital driven by accounts payable and the lapping of prior year cash payments associated with the settlement of the consolidated securities class action lawsuit, which were partially offset by higher cash outflows from inventory and variable compensation in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. Further, net cash by operating activities was favorably impacted by increased Adjusted Operating Income. **Free Cash Flow(1) **was $2.0 billion, up 9.7 percent versus the prior year period, driven by the same net cash provided by/(used for) operating activities discussed above. \n\n\n  * **Capital Return:** Year to date, the Company paid $1.5 billion in cash dividends and repurchased $538 million of common stock. Of the $538 million in share repurchases in 2024, $350 million were repurchased under the Company’s publicly announced share repurchase program and $188 million were purchased to offset the dilutive effect of equity-based compensation. As of Sept. 28, 2024, the Company had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately $2.4 billion of common stock under the publicly announced share repurchase program. \n\n\n\n**Outlook**\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, the Company now expects: \n\n  * **Organic Net Sales(2)** to be at the low end of the previous guidance range of down 2 percent to flat versus the prior year. \n\n\n  * **Adjusted Operating Income(2)**growth to be at the low end of the previous guidance range of 1 to 3 percent versus the prior year. This also contemplates expected Adjusted Gross Profit Margin(1)(2) expansion at the lower end of the previous range of 75 to 125 basis points versus the prior year. \n\n\n  * **Adjusted EPS(2)** growth to be at the low end of the previous guidance range of 1 to 3 percent, or in the range of $3.01 to $3.07. The Company expects an effective tax rate on Adjusted EPS to be approximately 21 percent. Additionally, the Company expects interest expense and other expense/(income) to be relatively flat versus the prior year. This guidance does not reflect any impact from future potential share repurchases. \n\n\n\n**End Notes**\n\n**(1)** |  Organic Net Sales, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EPS, and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see discussion of non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations at the end of this press release for more information.   \n---|---  \n**(2)** |  Guidance for Organic Net Sales, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Operating Income, and Adjusted EPS is provided on a non-GAAP basis only because certain information necessary to calculate the most comparable GAAP measure is unavailable due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence and the future financial statement impact of such items impacting comparability, including, but not limited to, the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, divestiture-related license income, restructuring activities, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters, equity award compensation expense, nonmonetary currency devaluation, and debt prepayment and extinguishment (benefit)/costs, among other items. Therefore, as a result of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of future adjustments, which could be significant, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures without unreasonable effort.   \n  \n**Earnings Discussion and Webcast Information**\n\nA pre-recorded management discussion of The Kraft Heinz Company's third quarter 2024 earnings is available at [ir.kraftheinzcompany.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.kraftheinzcompany.com%2F&esheet=54144116&newsitemid=20241030085196&lan=en-US&anchor=ir.kraftheinzcompany.com&index=1&md5=c94a1a188032050cb94176251d92a23c).

Words such as “accelerate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “commit,” “continue,” “expect,” “will,” “guidance,” and “outlook,” and variations of such words and similar future or conditional expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

For additional information on these and other factors that could affect the Company's forward-looking statements, see the Company's risk factors, as they may be amended from time to time, set forth in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Company disclaims and does not undertake any obligation to update, revise, or withdraw any forward-looking statement in this press release, except as required by applicable law or regulation. \n\nWe use our investor relations website, [ir.kraftheinzcompany.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.kraftheinzcompany.com%2F&esheet=54144116&newsitemid=20241030085196&lan=en-US&anchor=ir.kraftheinzcompany.com&index=4&md5=3845075ed3f6960c47be8b8f0e241019), as a routine channel for distribution of important, and often material, information about Kraft Heinz, including quarterly and annual earnings results and presentations, press releases and other announcements, webcasts, analyst presentations, investor days, sustainability initiatives, financial information, and corporate governance practices, as well as archives of past presentations and events. We encourage you to follow our investor relations website in addition to our filings with the SEC to receive timely information about the Company. The information on our website is not part of this press release and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filings we make with the SEC. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures provided in this press release should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). \n\nTo supplement the financial information provided, the Company has presented Organic Net Sales, Adjusted Operating Income, Constant Currency Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Net Income/(Loss), Adjusted EPS, Free Cash Flow, and Net Leverage which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, net income/(loss), gross profit, diluted earnings per share (“EPS”), net cash provided by/(used for) operating activities, or other measures prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing the Company’s performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company’s underlying operations. The Company believes: \n\n  * Organic Net Sales, Adjusted Operating Income, Constant Currency Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Net Income/(Loss), and Adjusted EPS provide important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess the Company’s operating performance on a consistent basis; and \n\n\n  * Free Cash Flow and Net Leverage provide measures of the Company’s core operating performance, the cash-generating capabilities of the Company’s business operations, and are factors used in determining the Company’s borrowing capacity and the amount of cash available for debt repayments, dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases, and other corporate purposes. \n\n\n\nManagement believes that presenting the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s results. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company’s business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. \n\n**Definitions**\n\n**_Organic Net Sales_** is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and a 53rd week of shipments. The Company calculates the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year's exchange rate, with the exception of highly inflationary subsidiaries, for which the Company calculates the previous year's results using the current year's exchange rate. \n\n**_Adjusted Operating Income_** is defined as operating income/(loss) excluding, when they occur, the impacts of restructuring activities, deal costs, unrealized gains/(losses) on commodity hedges (the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized; once realized, the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment’s operating results), impairment losses, and certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters. The Company also presents Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (**_Constant Currency Adjusted Operating Income_**). The Company calculates the impact of currency on Adjusted Operating Income by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year's exchange rate, with the exception of highly inflationary subsidiaries, for which it calculates the previous year's results using the current year's exchange rate. \n\n**_Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Net Income/(Loss), and Adjusted EPS_** are defined as gross profit, net income/(loss), and diluted earnings per share, respectively, excluding, when they occur, the impacts of restructuring activities, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, other losses/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures (e.g., tax and hedging impacts), nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), debt prepayment and extinguishment (benefit)/costs, and certain significant discrete income tax items (e.g., U.S. and non-U.S. tax reform), and including when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. **_Adjusted Gross Profit Margin_** is defined as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by net sales. \n\n**_Net Leverage_** is defined as debt less cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments divided by Adjusted EBITDA. **_Adjusted EBITDA_** is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding restructuring activities); in addition to these adjustments, the Company excludes, when they occur, the impacts of divestiture-related license income, restructuring activities, deal costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, certain non-ordinary course legal and regulatory matters, and equity award compensation expense (excluding restructuring activities). \n\n**_Free Cash Flow_** is defined as net cash provided by/(used for) operating activities less capital expenditures. The use of this non-GAAP measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. \n\nSchedule 1   \n---  \nThe Kraft Heinz Company Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income  (in millions, except per share data)  (Unaudited)   \n**For the Three
