XBOX\n\n_The Stealth Pivot’s Groundbreaking Rotating Thumbstick & Button Modules Provide Multiple Layouts to Make it THE Smart Controller Choice for Gamers Playing Multiple Game Types _\n\nWhite Plains, NY – November 26, 2024 – Leading gaming accessories maker [Turtle Beach](https://corp.turtlebeach.com/) [Corporation](https://corp.turtlebeach.com/) (Nasdaq: HEAR) today announced its pioneering controller with multiple button and stick layouts, the [**_Turtle Beach_**](https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/stealth-pivot-controller?utm_medium=pr&utm_campaign=TB_StealthPivotController_2024_ECM_NPIPOALL)[** _®_**](https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/stealth-pivot-controller?utm_medium=pr&utm_campaign=TB_StealthPivotController_2024_ECM_NPIPOALL)[** _Stealth™ Pivot_**](https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/stealth-pivot-controller?utm_medium=pr&utm_campaign=TB_StealthPivotController_2024_ECM_NPIPOALL), is now available. The **_Stealth Pivot’_** s groundbreaking rotating thumbstick and button control modules deliver simple, precise, and enhanced gameplay for any game type from FPS to fighting to racing and more. One layout provides traditional PC & Xbox gamepad controls, and the modules can be easily rotated and locked back into place to produce a D-pad and button layout more suitable for fighting and other game types. The **_Stealth Pivot_** is crafted from premium materials, including built-in Hall Effect sensors in the thumbsticks, and fans can also explore an impressive and extensive list of customization options. The **_Stealth Pivot_** smart controller works wirelessly and in wired mode for Windows 10/11 PCs, and is also Designed for Xbox and compatible with Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One as an advanced wired controller. The **_Stealth Pivot_** also features Bluetooth® 5.2 to connect with compatible Android devices and smart TVs.\n\n[GameRant](https://gamerant.com/turtle-beach-stealth-pivot-controller-review/) recently posted their review recommending the **_Stealth Pivot_** , saying, _“The**Stealth Pivot** is a solid premium controller that ticks all the right boxes,”_ and adding, _“In essence, it’s 3+ controllers in one and all of them work really well.”_ Additionally, [Xbox Era](https://xboxera.com/2024/11/25/turtle-beach-stealth-pivot-wireless-smart-controller-review/#google_vignette) reviewed the **_Stealth Pivot_** , calling it, _“One of the best premium controllers I’ve used in the last two years.”_\n\nThe **_Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot_** controller is available now at [www.turtlebeach.com](http://www.turtlebeach.com) and participating retailers worldwide for $129.99/£119.99/€129.99 MSRP.\n\n“The **_Stealth Pivot_** ’s first-of-their-kind rotating modules, premium build quality, and deep customization continue to demonstrate how Turtle Beach is at the forefront of innovation in gaming accessories,” said Cris Keirn, CEO, Turtle Beach Corporation.\n\nThe **_Stealth Pivot Smart Controller_** is designed for unmatched gameplay freedom. The **_Stealth_** **_Pivot_** ’s rotating button and stick modules quickly switch between core button layouts including FPS, action, and racing games on one side, and revolved layouts for fighting and retro games on the other side. Gamers can play wirelessly and lag-free on PC using the 2.4GHz wireless transmitter, as well as in wired mode for PC and on Xbox consoles using the included USB cable. Gamers can also connect to compatible Android devices and smart TVs via Bluetooth 5.2. The **_Stealth Pivot_** controller also features Turtle Beach’s _Connected Command Display_ which offers a variety of on-board customization options, including the ability to show social notifications. Additional customization is available through the _Turtle Beach Control Center 2_ app available on Xbox consoles and PC, and iOS and Android devices.\n\nContactless Hall Effect _AntiDrift™_ thumbsticks allow the **_Stealth Pivot_** to provide high-resolution, smooth control without drift, while adjustable trigger stops can be modified on-the-fly to suit the game being played – shorter hair trigger locks for faster FPS games or set to full travel for precise throttle and brake control when playing racing games. There are also four mappable microswitch buttons and up to five onboard profiles, allowing gamers to set the **_Stealth Pivot_** to their exact preferences per game.\n\nFor split-second in-game adjustments, the **_Stealth Pivot_** has a Quick-Slide Adjustment Switch located at its center. This switch has a return-to-center toggle and customizable RGB lighting, all of which can be mapped to a variety of functions. The **_Stealth Pivot_** ’s D-pad can also be set to classic digital input, or analog thumbstick response and tuned for fast actuation and reset, which is ideal for dishing out critical combos or completing complicated platform jumps. Turtle Beach’s _Pro-Aim™ Focus Mode_ , which tunes thumbstick sensitivity for enhanced long-range accuracy, is also available as a preset for any of the four mappable buttons.\n\nDual rumble motors in the **_Stealth Pivot_** ’s handles and triggers provide immersive vibration feedback and are fully adjustable via the _Connected Command Display_. A long-lasting 20-hour wireless battery life keeps PC gamers locked in the action, and the included USB cable supports play-and-charge capability when battery life runs out. The USB cable is required for use with Xbox consoles. And no Turtle Beach controller would be complete without offering the ability to connect any wired 3.5mm headset to get a suite of critical Turtle Beach gaming audio features, including EQ presets, _Superhuman Hearing ®_, game and chat volume mix, and more.\n\nFor additional information on the latest Turtle Beach products and accessories, visit [www.turtlebeach.com](https://www.turtlebeach.com/) and be sure to follow Turtle Beach on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@turtlebeach?lang=en), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/turtlebeach) _,_[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/turtlebeach) _,_ [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/turtlebeach) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/TurtleBeachVideos).\n\n**_About Turtle Beach Corporation_**\n\nTurtle Beach Corporation (the “Company”) ([www.turtlebeachcorp.com](https://corp.turtlebeach.com/)) is one of the world’s leading gaming accessory providers.

–_\n\nWHITE PLAINS, N.Y., Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — [Turtle Beach Corporation](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=McfcrXanJBu2xiw1W4hF7cX1ckg-A3SZS5E4-DDM7NczcPSjSCG0Uvul-jTmWJBWXdiW6fjsQyQgBjNJI1lhQSbHh0VRJaUr76q9P69jz7M=) (Nasdaq: HEAR), a leading gaming accessories brand, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter Highlights**\n\n  * Net revenue was $94.4 million, an increase of 60% compared to the prior year period.\n  * Net income was $3.4 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $(3.6) million or $(0.21) net loss per diluted share in the prior year period.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $16.3 million, an improvement of $15.2 million compared to an Adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 million in the prior year period.\n\n\n\n“We delivered another strong quarter of performance, showcasing the continued momentum in our business, and have made tremendous progress towards the integration of PDP following our transformative acquisition earlier this year. Our third quarter revenue grew 60% year-over-year to $94.4 million, while adjusted EBITDA increased significantly to $16.3 million, reflecting the benefits of our expanded portfolio and operational improvements. Excluding PDP’s contributions, our organic revenue grew approximately 15% compared to last year, highlighting the depth of our underlying business and an unwavering focus on execution. The gaming accessories market continues to show robust growth year-to-date, particularly in our core categories. We believe there are still additional synergies to be realized as we continue to optimize our operations,” said Cris Keirn, CEO, Turtle Beach Corporation.\n\n“Our market position continues to strengthen, with notable share gains across key categories. The integration of PDP is exceeding our expectations, and we now anticipate achieving total annual synergies exceeding $13 million, surpassing our initial estimates. Our gross margin expansion of 630 basis points year-over-year to 36.2% demonstrates the success of our cost optimization initiatives and reduced promotional spending.”\n\n“We’re excited about our upcoming product pipeline and the continued benefits from our increased scale and diversification. Our visibility regarding continued strong demand for our products ahead of the holiday season and our improved financial performance is reflected in our increased Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year, as we detail below. We remain focused on driving innovation, operational excellence, and market leadership while delivering value to our shareholders and gaming customers worldwide.\n\n“Further, our confidence in Turtle Beach’s value creation over the long-term is reflected in our share repurchase program, through which we bought back $10.1 million of stock in the third quarter alone. This repurchase came in addition to the more than $15 million of shares that we repurchased in the second quarter. Combined, the past two quarters mark the largest share repurchase in the history of Turtle Beach, punctuating our continued commitment to return capital to shareholders in conjunction with investing appropriately in the Company. We believe these repurchases represent a strategic investment that underscore our confidence in the Company’s future, based on our assessment of the intrinsic value of the shares.”\n\n**Share Repurchase Update** During the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 688,000 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10.1 million. The Company has repurchased $25.3 million year-to-date, and has $21.3 million remaining to repurchase shares under its share repurchase program which expires on April 9, 2025. \n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Summary** At September 30, 2024, the Company had net debt of $94.1 million, comprised of $107.9 million of borrowings less $13.8 million of cash. Inventories at September 30, 2024 were $102.3 million compared to $44.0 million at December 31, 2023 which now includes PDP. Cash flow used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $8.6 million compared to cash from operations of $7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nGiven the required investment in inventory that the Company undertakes ahead of the holiday season, it is typical that the Company’s net debt temporarily increases at the end of the third quarter of each year due to these working capital requirements.\n\n**Outlook** Turtle Beach is updating its 2024 outlook. The Company is maintaining its guidance for net revenue for the full year ending December 31, 2024, to be between $370 and $380 million. This revenue range translates to 43-47% growth year-over-year.\n\nThe Company currently expects Adjusted EBITDA for the full year ending December 31, 2024, to be between $55 and $58 million, up from the prior range of between $53 million to $56 million compared to $6.5 million of Adjusted EBITDA for 2023.\n\n**Earnings Conference Call and Webcast Details** Turtle Beach will host a conference call and audio webcast today, November 7, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time), during which management will discuss third quarter results and provide commentary on business performance and its current outlook for 2024. A question-and-answer session will follow the prepared remarks.\n\nThe conference call may be accessed by telephone by dialing 800-717-1738 (domestic) or 646-307-1865 (international).\n\nA live audio webcast of the earnings conference call may be accessed on Turtle Beach’s website at [www.corp.turtlebeach.com](http://www.corp.turtlebeach.com), along with a copy of this press release and an investor slide presentation. An audio replay of the call will be available on the Company’s investor relations website for a limited period of time.\n\n**About Turtle Beach Corporation**Turtle Beach Corporation (the “Company”) ([www.turtlebeachcorp.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-5B5SEXJxG2HuuPkgeG8xT8eep_fce-7A6XCVKIhSs4xZZJy4EstkGLeMtuRvL8GjhUmfvUN_f-jRb5RPS69Gk0OaZCiBoKlCp7hJ3dabtM=)) is one of the world’s leading gaming accessory providers. The Company’s namesake Turtle Beach brand ([www.turtlebeach.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-5B5SEXJxG2HuuPkgeG8xeJ-zVsCixUcFEhzVhCiMsl3h90YL9wEaqHzb2AygFFYir3oYatGVwu_cQ9EQYP34SYVaUACge7_nOQm7nfiYTA=)) is known for designing best-selling gaming headsets, top-rated game controllers, award-winning PC gaming peripherals, and groundbreaking gaming simulation accessories. Innovation, first-to-market features, a broad range of products for all types of gamers, and top-rated customer support have made Turtle Beach a fan-favorite brand and the market leader in console gaming audio for over a decade. Turtle Beach Corporation acquired Performance Designed Products LLC ([www.pdp.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=iLoMNBhjQS_3RWCAx8DbbHgVhXILm_ST_-W819aEuKyciXe4ek0arFL6HGNxLrfJIdhFI_TWBAb_Pn0H8GAYQg==)) in 2024. Turtle Beach’s shares are traded on the Nasdaq Exchange under the symbol: HEAR.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** In addition to its reported results, the Company has included in this earnings release certain financial metrics, including Adjusted EBITDA, that the Securities and Exchange Commission define as “non-GAAP financial measures.” Management believes that such non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s results. Non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative to the Company’s GAAP financial results and may not be calculated in the same manner as similar measures presented by other companies. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined by the Company as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation (non-cash), and certain non-recurring special items that we believe are not representative of core operations, as further described in Table 4. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance, to perform financial planning, and to determine incentive compensation. Therefore, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors. The non-GAAP financial measures included herein exclude items that management does not believe reflect the Company’s core operating performance because such items are inherently unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash. See a reconciliation of GAAP results to Adjusted EBITDA included as Table 4 below for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024.\n\nBy providing full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance, the Company provided its expectation of a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure. Information reconciling full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss), is unavailable to the Company without unreasonable effort due to the variability, complexity, and lack of visibility with respect to certain reconciling items between Adjusted EBITDA and net income (loss), including other income (expense), provision for income taxes and stock-based compensation. These items cannot be reasonably and accurately predicted without the investment of undue time, cost and other resources and, accordingly, a reconciliation of the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA outlook to its net income (loss) outlook for such periods is not provided. These reconciling items could be material to the Company’s actual results for such periods.\n\n**Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements** This press release includes forward-looking information and statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Except for historical information contained in this release, statements in this release may constitute forward-looking statements regarding assumptions, projections, expectations, targets, intentions, or beliefs about future events. Statements containing the words “may”, “could”, “would”, “should”, “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “plan”, “estimate”, “target”, “goal”, “project”, “intend” and similar expressions, or the negatives thereof, constitute forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. The inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company, or any person, that the objectives of the Company will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s current beliefs and expectations, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management.\n\nWhile the Company believes that its expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurances that its goals and strategy will be realized. Numerous factors, including risks and uncertainties, may affect actual results and may cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company or on its behalf. Some of these factors include, but are not limited to, risks related to logistic and supply chain challenges and costs, the substantial uncertainties inherent in the acceptance of existing and future products, the difficulty of commercializing and protecting new technology, the impact of competitive products and pricing, general business and economic conditions, risks associated with the expansion of our business including the integration of any businesses we acquire and the integration of such businesses within our internal control over financial reporting and operations, our indebtedness, liquidity, and other factors discussed in our public filings, including the risk factors included in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the Company’s other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Some of these factors include, but are not limited to, risks related to logistic and supply chain challenges and costs, the substantial uncertainties inherent in the acceptance of existing and future products, the difficulty of commercializing and protecting new technology, the impact of competitive products and pricing, general business and economic conditions, risks associated with the expansion of our business, including the integration of any businesses we acquire and the integration of such businesses within our internal control over financial reporting and operations, our indebtedness, liquidity, and other factors discussed in our public filings, including the risk factors included in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the Company’s other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company is under no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement after the date of this release whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\nⒸSEGA.
