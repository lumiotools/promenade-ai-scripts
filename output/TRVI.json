Haduvio acts on the cough reflex arc both centrally and peripherally as a kappa agonist and a mu antagonist (KAMA), which are opioid receptors that play a key role in controlling cough hypersensitivity. Nalbuphine is not currently scheduled by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. \n\nChronic cough is highly prevalent among approximately 140,000 IPF patients in the U.S., with up to 85% of IPF patients experiencing chronic cough. The impact of chronic cough is significant with some IPF patients coughing up to 1,500 times per day and may lead to worsening disease, a higher risk of progression, death, or need for lung transplant. Chronic cough also often leads to a decline in patients' social, physical, and psychological quality of life. There are no approved therapies for the treatment of chronic cough in IPF and current off-label treatment options provide minimal benefit to patients. \n\nRefractory chronic cough affects approximately 2-3 million adults in the U.S. and is caused by cough reflex hypersensitivity in both the central and peripheral nerves. It is highly disruptive and accompanied by a wide range of complications, ranging from urinary incontinence in females to sleep disruption and social embarrassment that causes significant social and economic burdens for patients and those around them. Haduvio is being developed for the treatment of moderate to severe RCC.

Haduvio acts on the cough reflex arc both centrally and peripherally as a kappa agonist and a mu antagonist (KAMA), which are opioid receptors that play a key role in controlling cough hypersensitivity. Nalbuphine is not scheduled by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nThe impact of chronic cough is significant and often leads to a decline in patients' social, physical, and psychological quality of life. In IPF, chronic cough may lead to worsening disease and may be associated with a higher risk of progression, death, or need for lung transplant. There are no approved therapies for the treatment of chronic cough in IPF and current treatment options provide minimal benefit to patients. Chronic cough affects up to 10% of the adult population, and Haduvio's expansion into RCC has the potential to reach patients suffering from moderate to severe refractory chronic cough. There are also no approved therapies for RCC in the U.S.\n\nTrevi intends to propose Haduvio as the trade name for oral nalbuphine ER. Its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.\n\nFor more information, visit _[www.TreviTherapeutics.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4291033-1&h=328817199&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trevitherapeutics.com%2F&a=www.TreviTherapeutics.com)_ and follow Trevi on _[X](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4291033-1&h=1038853792&u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FTreviThera&a=X)_ (formerly Twitter) and _[LinkedIn](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4291033-1&h=1177866332&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Ftrevi-therapeutics-inc-%2F&a=LinkedIn)_.\n\n**Investor Contact** Katie BarrettTrevi Therapeutics, Inc.203-304-2499k.barrett@trevitherapeutics.com\n\n**Media Contact** Rosalia Scampoli914-815-1465rscampoli@marketcompr.com\n\nSOURCE Trevi Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nMedia Contact\n\n**Katie McManus** (203) 903-9627 k.mcmanus@trevitherapeutics.com\n\n**Trevi Therapeutics** 195 Church Street, 14th Floor New Haven, CT 06510 [map](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=195+church+st+new+haven+ct&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=195+Church+St,+New+Haven,+Connecticut+06510&gl=us&t=m&ll=41.316433,-72.922354&spn=0.022563,0.036478&z=14&iwloc=A&source=embed)\n\n![](image/Trevi_logo_color_sm.png)\n\nRegister to receive real time alerts\n\n* Required Fields \n\n* Email\n"

Industry publications and third-party research, surveys and studies generally indicate that their\ninformation has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. We believe that these\nthird-party sources and estimates are reliable but have not independently verified them. Our estimates of the potential market opportunities for our product candidates\ninclude several key assumptions based on our industry knowledge, industry publications, third-party research and other surveys, which may be based on a small sample size\nand may fail to accurately reflect market opportunities. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, no independent source has verified such assumptions.\nThe industry in which we operate is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of important factors that could cause results to differ materially from\nthose expressed in the estimates made by third parties and by us.\n2\nTrevi is Controlling Cough Where It Counts\nSignificant unmet need in chronic\ncough with no approved therapies\nUnique central and peripheral\nmechanism with validated biology\nPositive data in IPF chronic cough\nSpecialty pricing and sales model\nSignificant market opportunity\n3\nHaduvio (nalbuphine ER) is an investigational drug\nHaduvio Advancing Clinical Development Plans\nIndications Preclinical Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3\nChronic Cough in Idiopathic\nPulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)\nHaduvio\n(nalbuphine ER)\nRefractory Chronic Cough (RCC)\nSupporting Clinical Studies\n• Ph1 Respiratory Physiology Study in IPF • Human Abuse Potential (HAP) Study\nPh2a Data Supports Mechanism in IPF Chronic Cough\n• 75.1% reduction in daytime cough frequency from study baseline, 52.5% placebo-adjusted\nchange (p<0.0001)\n• Patient and clinician reported outcomes were consistent with the reduction in daytime\ncough frequency and were statistically significant\n4\nHaduvio (nalbuphine ER) is an investigational drug\nDifferentiated Central and Peripheral Mechanism of Action\nBrain\nCauses of Cough Hypersensitivity\nBrainstem\nCentral Nervous System Peripheral Nervous System\n• Cortical reorganization • Mechanical stress\n• Altered sensory perception • Inflammation\nCough\n• Cognitive responses • Loss of lung tissue\nto airway inputs\nHaduvio (nalbuphine ER)\nImportance of Central and Peripheral Activity\nChemoreceptors Vagal afferents\nHaduvio acts on the cough reflex arc both centrally and\nA Delta-fiber\nperipherally as a kappa agonist and a mu antagonist\nMechanoreceptors\nC fiber (KAMA), which are opioid receptors that play a key role in\ncontrolling cough hypersensitivity.\nLUNGS\nGraphic: Vigeland CL et al, Respiratory Medicine 2017 doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2016.12.016\nHaduvio (nalbuphine ER) is an investigational drug 5\n1Chung KF et al Nat Res 2022 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41572-022-00370-w 2Mann J et al.
