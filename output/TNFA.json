(Nasdaq: TNFA) (“TNFA” or the “Company”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing novel therapies for age-related diseases, and autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, today announced that it is preparing to advance its lead program, MYMD-1®, through fully funded mid-stage clinical trials. MYMD-1 is a small molecule shown to block excessive activity of TNF-alpha (TNF-α) in the blood to regulate the immuno-metabolic system. The next clinical studies of MYMD-1 will further explore the drug’s efficacy in sarcopenia/frailty following statistically significant positive results from an earlier Phase 2 clinical study. \n\n“In our view, MYMD-1, if approved, could be the first orally administered TNF-alpha inhibitor drug and the first and only therapy for sarcopenia, a common age-related disorder that causes a prolonged decline in physical function. The success of our clinical strategy and regulatory pathway to date supports MYMD-1’s potential to disrupt the TNF-alpha inhibitor market,” said Mitchell Glass, M.D., President and Chief Medical Officer of TNF Pharmaceuticals. “As we prepare for our next fully funded clinical studies in sarcopenia/frailty, we also have open INDs for Phase 2 trials of MYMD-1 in two additional chronic inflammatory conditions, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, which we could pursue with the support of non-dilutive domestic and/or international development partnerships. A partner outside of the U.S. could potentially help us accelerate the timeline to commercialization of our lead asset. \n\n“Each of MYMD-1’s indications provide solid measures of Company value,” Dr. Glass continued. “We are excited about the positive data we have gathered so far for our lead asset. Our next steps, to be revealed soon, will extend our reach toward significant and sustainable value creation, and long-term Company growth.” \n\n**MYMD-1 Phase 2 Clinical Development**\n\nMYMD-1 targets TNF-alpha (TNF-alpha tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or TNF-α), a protein in the body that plays a key role in inflammation and autoimmunity. \n\n**Sarcopenia.** A small Phase 2 study, completed in 2023, investigated the efficacy, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MYMD-1 in the treatment of participants with chronic inflammation associated with sarcopenia/frailty. The study met its primary endpoints for significantly reducing chronic inflammatory markers with statistically significant results. \n\n  * MYMD-1 significantly reduced serum levels of chronic inflammatory markers and met all primary pharmacokinetic and secondary safety and tolerability endpoints. \n  * MYMD-1 demonstrated statistical significance across three biomarkers: TNF-α (P=0.008), sTNFR1 (P=0.02), and IL-6 (P=0.03). \n  * No treatment-related adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred over the course of the study. \n\n\n\nSarcopenia, the aging-related progressive loss of muscle mass and strength in older people and in a growing population of younger people, is a condition which leads to greater risk of hospitalization, disability, and death. With no FDA-approved treatments for sarcopenia, the estimated $40+ billion in related hospitalization costs is a considerable economic burden on the U.S. healthcare system.1\n\n**Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**. An Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a Phase 2 study of MYMD-1 in RA was reviewed and approved by the FDA in August 2023. \n\nMYMD-1’s small molecule design enables the drug to cross the blood brain barrier for entry into the central nervous system. In a preclinical trial, MYMD-1 was shown to significantly reduce swelling and other clinical arthritis measures compared to the widely used RA therapy Enbrel® (etanercept).2 Disease severity (total composite score) was reduced by 47% with MYMD-1 (450 mg/kg/day orally) versus a 37% reduction with etanercept (10 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection). \n\nRA is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder that causes chronic inflammation of the joints and affects approximately 1.5 million Americans. RA’s cost to society, including healthcare costs; loss of employment; costs to employers, government, and caregivers; and costs associated with a deterioration of quality of life, is estimated to be over $40 billion annually.3\n\n**Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.** MYMD holds an FDA-cleared IND for a Phase 2 pilot study of MYMD-1 for Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, a condition in which the immune system stops recognizing the thyroid as part of the body and begins attacking it. \n\nHashimoto’s thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States.4 According to an American Thyroid Association report, approximately 12% of the U.S. population will develop a thyroid condition during their lifetime and an approximate amount of 20 million Americans are diagnosed with some form of thyroid disease during their lifetime.5 The [global thyroid gland disorder market](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/press-release/thyroid-gland-disorder-treatment-market.html) was valued at $2.1 billion in 2017, and is estimated to reach $2.7 billion by 2025 at a CAGR of 3.8% from 2018 to 2025.6\n\n**Secondary Drug Platform — Supera-CBD ™**\n\nTNFA’s secondary drug platform, Supera-CBD™, is a synthetic, non-toxic cannabidiol (CBD) analog that is an 8000-times more potent CB2 agonist than plant-based CBD.7 Supera-CBD is targeted for the treatment of epilepsy, pain and anxiety/depression. Based on an in vitro binding analysis of Supera-CBD with three types of opioid receptors, the profile suggests that Supera-CBD could play a role in treating opioid addiction. \n\n**About TNF Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nTNF Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: TNFA) (formerly known as MyMD Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company committed to extending healthy lifespan, is focused on developing two novel therapeutic platforms that treat the causes of disease rather than only addressing the symptoms. MYMD-1® is a drug platform based on a clinical stage small molecule that regulates the immune system to control TNF-α, which drives chronic inflammation, and other pro-inflammatory cell signaling cytokines.

(Nasdaq: MYMD) (the “Company”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing novel therapies for age-related diseases and autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, today announced a rebranding to the new name “TNF Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,” effective today. The Company’s common stock, listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, will begin trading under the new stock symbol “TNFA,” effective before the market open on Wednesday, July 24, 2024. \n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240722253499/en/>\n\n“Our new name, TNF Pharmaceuticals, is more closely aligned with our scientific focus on TNF-alpha, a protein in the body that plays a key role in inflammation and autoimmunity,” said the Company’s President and Chief Medical Officer Mitchell Glass, M.D. “Excess TNF-α in the blood or tissue can lead to diseases and disorders marked by acute or chronic inflammation, including age-related disorders. Our lead clinical candidate, MYMD-1®, blocks the activity of excess TNF-alpha which supports restoration of control and regulation of the immune system.” \n\nMYMD-1 is a novel, orally dosed TNF-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitor drug for treating multiple conditions related to immune-metabolic dysregulation. A successful and statistically significant small Phase 2 study was completed in 2023, evaluating the safety and efficacy of MYMD-1 as a treatment for sarcopenia, the progressive loss of muscle mass and strength associated with aging. \n\n“We are moving forward with mid-stage clinical trials of MYMD-1 in sarcopenia based on positive clinical data from our Phase 2 trial and previous research findings,” Dr. Glass continued. “We believe MYMD-1 could become a transformative treatment for TNF-alpha-based autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including age-related conditions.” \n\nMYMD-1 is distinguished from currently marketed TNF-α blockers in multiple ways. It is a first-in-class oral treatment shown to reduce TNF-α and inflammation without infusion or injection. The drug’s ease of oral dosing is a strong advantage over currently available TNF-α blockers, none of which are dosed orally. Unlike systemic therapies, our oral TNF alpha inhibitor can be dose adjusted acutely and chronically for maximal safety and efficacy depending on the patient’s need. \n\nTNF Pharmaceuticals retains the registered trademark MYMD-1® for its lead drug program. The Company’s new Investors website address is **[ir.tnfpharma.com](http://ir.tnfpharma.com)**. \n\n**About TNF Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nTNF Pharmaceuticals, Inc., formerly known as MyMD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a clinical stage pharmaceutical company committed to extending healthy lifespan, is focused on developing two novel therapeutic platforms that treat the causes of disease rather than only addressing the symptoms. MYMD-1® is a drug platform based on a clinical stage small molecule that regulates the immune system to control TNF-α, which drives chronic inflammation, and other pro-inflammatory cell signaling cytokines. MYMD-1 is being developed to treat diseases and disorders marked by acute or chronic inflammation. The Company’s second drug platform, Supera-CBD, is being developed to treat chronic pain, addiction and epilepsy. Supera-CBD is a novel synthetic derivative of cannabidiol (CBD) and is being developed to address and improve upon the rapidly growing CBD market, which includes both FDA approved drugs and CBD products not currently regulated as drugs. \n\n**Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements.

(Nasdaq: TNFA) (“TNFA” or the “Company”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing novel therapies for age-related diseases, and autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, today announced that it is preparing to advance its lead program, MYMD-1®, through fully funded mid-stage clinical trials. MYMD-1 is a small molecule shown to block excessive activity of TNF-alpha (TNF-α) in the blood to regulate the immuno-metabolic system. The next clinical studies of MYMD-1 will further explore the drug’s efficacy in sarcopenia/frailty following statistically significant positive results from an earlier Phase 2 clinical study. \n\n“In our view, MYMD-1, if approved, could be the first orally administered TNF-alpha inhibitor drug and the first and only therapy for sarcopenia, a common age-related disorder that causes a prolonged decline in physical function. The success of our clinical strategy and regulatory pathway to date supports MYMD-1’s potential to disrupt the TNF-alpha inhibitor market,” said Mitchell Glass, M.D., President and Chief Medical Officer of TNF Pharmaceuticals. “As we prepare for our next fully funded clinical studies in sarcopenia/frailty, we also have open INDs for Phase 2 trials of MYMD-1 in two additional chronic inflammatory conditions, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, which we could pursue with the support of non-dilutive domestic and/or international development partnerships. A partner outside of the U.S. could potentially help us accelerate the timeline to commercialization of our lead asset. \n\n“Each of MYMD-1’s indications provide solid measures of Company value,” Dr. Glass continued. “We are excited about the positive data we have gathered so far for our lead asset. Our next steps, to be revealed soon, will extend our reach toward significant and sustainable value creation, and long-term Company growth.” \n\n**MYMD-1 Phase 2 Clinical Development**\n\nMYMD-1 targets TNF-alpha (TNF-alpha tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or TNF-α), a protein in the body that plays a key role in inflammation and autoimmunity. \n\n**Sarcopenia.** A small Phase 2 study, completed in 2023, investigated the efficacy, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MYMD-1 in the treatment of participants with chronic inflammation associated with sarcopenia/frailty. The study met its primary endpoints for significantly reducing chronic inflammatory markers with statistically significant results. \n\n  * MYMD-1 significantly reduced serum levels of chronic inflammatory markers and met all primary pharmacokinetic and secondary safety and tolerability endpoints. \n  * MYMD-1 demonstrated statistical significance across three biomarkers: TNF-α (P=0.008), sTNFR1 (P=0.02), and IL-6 (P=0.03). \n  * No treatment-related adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred over the course of the study. \n\n\n\nSarcopenia, the aging-related progressive loss of muscle mass and strength in older people and in a growing population of younger people, is a condition which leads to greater risk of hospitalization, disability, and death. With no FDA-approved treatments for sarcopenia, the estimated $40+ billion in related hospitalization costs is a considerable economic burden on the U.S. healthcare system.1\n\n**Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**. An Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a Phase 2 study of MYMD-1 in RA was reviewed and approved by the FDA in August 2023. \n\nMYMD-1’s small molecule design enables the drug to cross the blood brain barrier for entry into the central nervous system. In a preclinical trial, MYMD-1 was shown to significantly reduce swelling and other clinical arthritis measures compared to the widely used RA therapy Enbrel® (etanercept).2 Disease severity (total composite score) was reduced by 47% with MYMD-1 (450 mg/kg/day orally) versus a 37% reduction with etanercept (10 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection). \n\nRA is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder that causes chronic inflammation of the joints and affects approximately 1.5 million Americans. RA’s cost to society, including healthcare costs; loss of employment; costs to employers, government, and caregivers; and costs associated with a deterioration of quality of life, is estimated to be over $40 billion annually.3\n\n**Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.** MYMD holds an FDA-cleared IND for a Phase 2 pilot study of MYMD-1 for Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, a condition in which the immune system stops recognizing the thyroid as part of the body and begins attacking it. \n\nHashimoto’s thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States.4 According to an American Thyroid Association report, approximately 12% of the U.S. population will develop a thyroid condition during their lifetime and an approximate amount of 20 million Americans are diagnosed with some form of thyroid disease during their lifetime.5 The [global thyroid gland disorder market](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/press-release/thyroid-gland-disorder-treatment-market.html) was valued at $2.1 billion in 2017, and is estimated to reach $2.7 billion by 2025 at a CAGR of 3.8% from 2018 to 2025.6\n\n**Secondary Drug Platform — Supera-CBD ™**\n\nTNFA’s secondary drug platform, Supera-CBD™, is a synthetic, non-toxic cannabidiol (CBD) analog that is an 8000-times more potent CB2 agonist than plant-based CBD.7 Supera-CBD is targeted for the treatment of epilepsy, pain and anxiety/depression. Based on an in vitro binding analysis of Supera-CBD with three types of opioid receptors, the profile suggests that Supera-CBD could play a role in treating opioid addiction. \n\n**About TNF Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nTNF Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: TNFA) (formerly known as MyMD Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company committed to extending healthy lifespan, is focused on developing two novel therapeutic platforms that treat the causes of disease rather than only addressing the symptoms.

(Nasdaq: MYMD) (the “Company”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing novel therapies for age-related diseases and autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, today announced a rebranding to the new name “TNF Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,” effective today.

Our lead clinical candidate, MYMD-1®, blocks the activity of excess TNF-alpha which supports restoration of control and regulation of the immune system.” \n\nMYMD-1 is a novel, orally dosed TNF-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitor drug for treating multiple conditions related to immune-metabolic dysregulation. A successful and statistically significant small Phase 2 study was completed in 2023, evaluating the safety and efficacy of MYMD-1 as a treatment for sarcopenia, the progressive loss of muscle mass and strength associated with aging. \n\n“We are moving forward with mid-stage clinical trials of MYMD-1 in sarcopenia based on positive clinical data from our Phase 2 trial and previous research findings,” Dr. Glass continued. “We believe MYMD-1 could become a transformative treatment for TNF-alpha-based autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including age-related conditions.” \n\nMYMD-1 is distinguished from currently marketed TNF-α blockers in multiple ways. It is a first-in-class oral treatment shown to reduce TNF-α and inflammation without infusion or injection. The drug’s ease of oral dosing is a strong advantage over currently available TNF-α blockers, none of which are dosed orally. Unlike systemic therapies, our oral TNF alpha inhibitor can be dose adjusted acutely and chronically for maximal safety and efficacy depending on the patient’s need. \n\nTNF Pharmaceuticals retains the registered trademark MYMD-1® for its lead drug program.

It is associated with chronic pain, loss of\nfunction, and disability. The murine model of Collagen Antibody Induced Arthritis (CAIA) mimics many of the\nfeatures of arthritis in humans and has been used successfully in addressing questions of disease pathogenesis\nand to screen candidate therapeutic agents. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a proinflammatory cytokine\nthat plays a pivotal role in regulating the inflammatory response in chronic autoimmune diseases such as RA.\nThe discovery of the role of TNF-α in the pathogenesis of RA has led to anti-TNF biological therapies as a\nbreakthrough in the treatment of RA. The objective of this study was to investigate anti-inflammatory effects of\nMYMD-1®, a small molecule selective inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) with easy access to the\nbody including the brain, in the murine CAIA model.\nAdapted from poster presentation at the 2023 SOT Annual Meeting: P148\n11 MyMD | Corporate Overview April 2023\nA Naturally Occurring Novel Therapeutic and Oral Selective Inhibitor of TNF-α,\nMYMD-1® (Isomyosamine), Significantly Reduced the Inflammation and Disease\nSeverity in Murine Model of Collagen Antibody Induced Arthritis\n2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\nThe CAIA model was induced in female Balb/c mice by an intravenous injection of a monoclonal antibodies\ncocktail that are directed to collagen type II on Day 1 (sensitization), followed by an intraperitoneal injection of the endotoxin LPS on Day 6\n(boost immunization). Three oral doses of MYMD-1® (50, 250 and 450 mg/kg/day) given BID (two times a day) were tested starting at the\nonset of the disease (Day 8 in this study). In addition, Dexamethasone was given daily by oral gavage at 0.3mg/kg and Etanercept was\nadministered subcutaneously twice weekly at 10 mg/kg, both as positive controls. The therapeutic effect of MYMD-1® on inflammation was\nassessed by measuring the clinical score and paw inflammation (volume). At termination, the histopathological features such as infiltration\nof polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells, pannus formation, cartilage degradation and bone resorption of the affected joints were\nanalyzed. Statistical analysis were performed using Unpaired student t-test, One-Way or Two-way ANOVA in comparison to the\nCAIA/vehicle control. *;+p<0.05; **; ++p<0.01; ***;+++p<0.001; ****;++++p<0.0001.\nAdapted from poster presentation at the 2023 SOT Annual Meeting: P148\n12 MyMD | Corporate Overview April 2023\nA Naturally Occurring Novel Therapeutic and Oral Selective Inhibitor of TNF-α,\nMYMD-1® (Isomyosamine), Significantly Reduced the Inflammation and Disease\nSeverity in Murine Model of Collagen Antibody Induced Arthritis\n3 IN-LIFE RESULTS\nFollowing arthritis induction, paw inflammation was observed starting from Day 8, peaked on Days 11 to 13 and then slowly decreased towards\nthe end of the study (Days 20 to 21). Treatment with MYMD-1® 450 mg/kg/day significantly reduced the clinical score and the paw volume in\nBALB/c arthritic mice when compared to CAIA disease control (Figure 1). A similar observation was noted with MYMD-1® at 250 mg/kg/day but at\nlesser extent. There was no clinical signs and no effect on body weights associated with MYMD-1® treatment.\nAdapted from poster presentation at the\n2023 SOT Annual Meeting: P148\nMyMD | Corporate Overview April 2023\nA Naturally Occurring Novel Therapeutic and Oral Selective Inhibitor of TNF-α,\nMYMD-1® (Isomyosamine), Significantly Reduced the Inflammation and Disease\nSeverity in Murine Model of Collagen Antibody Induced Arthritis\n4 HISTOPATHOLOGY RESULTS\nHistopathological changes associated with arthritis (inflammation, erosion,\nsynovial hyperplasia, bone degeneration and periosteal changes) were\nobserved in CAIA/vehicle control animals. Disease severity (total composite\nscore) was reduced by 47% with MYMD-1® at 450 mg/kg/day while the\nreduction was 37% with Etanercept at 10 mg/kg (Figure 2). MYMD-1® at\n50mg/kg/day had no reductive effect on the disease state. Scanned images\nobtained from decalcified left hindlimbs stained with H&E show the thickening\nof the joint space by pannus and inflammation in the vehicle control when\ncompared to MYMD-1® (450mg/kg) treatment (Figure 3).\nFigure 3: Representatitve Hematoxilin Eosin (H&E) staining of decalcified left hindpaw\nUpon low and high magnification in the tibiotarso-metatarsal joint, joint space is thickened by\npannus and inflammation (arrows) in vehicle control when compared to MYMD-1® treated\nanimal. Periosteal reaction (bone exostosis) is also noted (arrowhead) in the vehicle control.\nAdapted from poster presentation at the 2023 SOT Annual Meeting: P148\n14 MyMD | Corporate Overview April 2023\nA Naturally Occurring Novel Therapeutic and Oral Selective Inhibitor of TNF-α,\nMYMD-1® (Isomyosamine), Significantly Reduced the Inflammation and Disease\nSeverity in Murine Model of Collagen Antibody Induced Arthritis\n5 CONCLUSION\nMYMD-1® administration at 450 mg/kg/day inhibited arthritis development in\nCollagen Antibody Induce Arthritis murine model, with in-life data consistent with\nhistopathological findings. Moreover, no clinical signs or body weight loss was\nassociated with MYMD-1® treatment at 450mg/kg/day. Unlike currently available\nTNF-α inhibitors, MYMD-1® can be given orally and is a promising drug for\nrheumatoid arthritis.\nAdapted from poster presentation at the\n2023 SOT Annual Meeting: P148\n15 MyMD | Corporate Overview April 2023\nMYMD-1® Regulatory Pathway in RA\nDouble-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study: Recruiting 3rd Quarter of 2023\n12 weeks Oral Capsule Male and Female Adults Rheumatoid Arthritis United States\nPhase 2 study investigating\nPlanned\nthe efficacy, tolerability Planned IND Planned IRB Protocol Planned Patient\nEnrollment/Dosing\nSubmission Approval Recruitment\nand pharmacokinetics of to Begin\nMyMD-1® in the treatment 2Q2023 2Q2023 3Q2023\n3Q2023\nof participants with RA\nOBJECTIVES ENDPOINTS\nPrimary Primary Efficacy Endpoint\n• Demonstrate that MYMD-1® added to MTX, in participants with\nmoderate-to-severe active RA, is effective for reduction of signs • Percentage of Participants Achieving American College of\nand symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis at 28 days.

To date, our collaboration with\nBascom Palmer has included pre-clinical and clinical investigations.\nPre-Clinical\n• In July 2022 we entered into a Material Transfer Agreement with Bascom Palmer. Our collaboration was announced in a press\nrelease and in an article in Ophthalmology Times. Bascom Palmer confirmed in August 2022 that it had received a quantity of\nour MYMD-1® product candidate and MyMD provided a material safety datasheet and certification of analysis.\n• In August 2022, Bascom Palmer researchers conducted a preliminary introductory study of TON in mice. Investigators ran a\ncrush injury of the mice’s optic nerves with and without MYMD-1®. The study drug was given once per day via oral gavage at a\ndosage of 30 mg/kg of body weight. The mice were treated for five days, untreated for two days, and then sacrificed, and their\nTNF-α levels were measured. Data from this study is pending. We intend to plan additional pre-clinical studies.\nClinical\n• In addition to the pre-clinical study described above, we are collaborating with Bascom Palmer to plan future a clinical study. In\nAugust 2022, Bascom Palmer researchers executed a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement, and Bascom Palmer\nproduced a draft protocol synopsis entitled, Assessment of the Anti-Inflammatory Effects of MYMD-1® in Non-Infectious Anterior\nUveitis: A Randomized Controlled, Double Blind Clinical Study.\n24 MMyyMMDD || CCoorrppoorraattee OOvveerrvviieeww April 2023\nAdditional Programs Completed\nNeurology/Depression Program\nPre-Clinical Completed Immune-Mediated Depression\nPre-Clinical Completed Multiple Sclerosis\nPre-Clinical Completed MS Depression\n25 MMyyMMDD || CCoorrppoorraattee OOvveerrvviieeww April 2023\nExploring Unmet Needs In Epilepsy,\nChronic Pain And Anxiety\nSupera-CBD™ : Next-Generation Synthetic Cannabinoid\nDEA scientific review concluded Supera-CBD will not be considered a controlled substance or listed chemical\nOpportunity in Epilepsy, Chronic Pain, and Anxiety for Supera-CBD™\nIt is estimated\nEpilepsy\nthat the total value Anxiety\nof lost productivity\ndue to chronic pain is\n50.2 $300B\nannually\nMillion\n(20.5%)\nU.S. adults experience\nchronic pain based on\nGeneralized\nanalysis of NHIS data\nanxiety disorder\nAdults\n(GAD) affects\nwith epilepsy 3.1%\n6.8M\n∼3M\nEpilepsy in adults of the U.S.\nseniors is up to population\nin the U.S.\n240 An estimated only\nper 100,000\n∼470,000 31.1% 43.2%\nper year are receiving\nChildren have of U.S. adults experience\nan anxiety disorder at treatment\nactive epilepsy\nsome time in their\nChronic Pain lives\nin the U.S.\nReferences\nCDC 2020, Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment, 2016, Harvard Medical School, 2007.
