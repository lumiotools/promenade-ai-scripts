The fully-dynamic headless site enables the flexibility, customization and performance needed to elevate customer shopping experiences and scale the business without compromise. \n\nBigCommerce partner agency [Business Changers](https://business-changers.it/en/) leveraged the platform’s headless architecture to develop Boxeur’s site on Next.js, using MACH (microservices, API-first, cloud native, headless) principles. The MACH approach allows each tech component of the site to be updated or modified independently, improving operational efficiency and the site's adaptability to future technological and market needs for growth and agility. \n\nWithin a few days of going live on BigCommerce, Boxeur’s bounce rate decreased nearly 8% while site sessions experienced a 14% increase and page load times reduced from five seconds to under one second. These results indicate a significant improvement in users exploring the site and engaging with its content, while attracting more target users and retaining them longer, facilitating them through the path to purchase. \n\nBigCommerce was selected by Boxeur des Rues for its flexibility, reliability, and comprehensive tools, which are essential for managing and growing an online store. \n\n  * **All-In-One Solution:** Provides an integrated platform offering to manage all aspects of their online store without needing additional tools or resources, greatly simplifying operational management and reducing costs associated with purchasing separate software. \n  * **Customization and Scalability:** The platform’s extensive customization through an API-first approach enables Boxeur to create a unique, branded online store and handle high traffic and sales volumes, making it ideal for seamless business growth and scalability. \n  * **Advanced Tools:** BigCommerce’s comprehensive range of tools offers a high level of customization, marketing capabilities, multi-channel selling, data insights, and strong security features that helps Boxeur better streamline operations and drive higher sales without compromising on performance or security. \n  * **Reliability and Security:** The platform ensures high reliability with 99.99% uptime, ensuring Boxeur’s online store remains operational even during peak traffic periods like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Moreover, BigCommerce offers secure integrations with payment gateways, ensuring smooth and secure transactions for customers. \n\n\n\n“The collaboration between BigCommerce and Business Changers in implementing the ecommerce platform for Boxeur des Rues has not only enhanced the technical performance of the website, but also significantly improved user engagement and yielded remarkable results,” said Federico Viterbo, innovation labs team leader at Business Changers. “Together we are empowering Boxeur to scale their business, increase sales and deliver a better customer experience by giving them access to a rich ecosystem of integrated tools, expert services and new sales channels.” \n\nRounding out Boxeur’s headless transformation are integrations with Google Analytics, AWS, Stripe and other best-in-breed tech tools that deliver the speed and innovation for their brand and internal users and ultimately a more secure and personal user experience for customers. \n\n“Growing brands and retailers need architectures best equipped for change and a headless and composable architecture is the preferred model for progressive brands like Boxeur des Rues because of the flexibility and agility it provides to adapt to change and proliferate growth,” said Mark Howes, vice president of Southern Europe at BigCommerce. “Boxeur is now able to deliver a powerful ecommerce experience for both in-house teams and customers, and is only prosperous from here.” \n\nBoxeur des Rues joins a growing list of fashion and apparel brands and retailers using BigCommerce including [Coldwater Creek](https://www.coldwatercreek.com/), [Harvey Nichols](https://www.harveynichols.com/), [Diamond’s Direct](https://diamondsdirect.com/) and [White Stuff](https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/white-stuff/). \n\nTo learn more about BigCommerce’s headless solutions, [click here](https://www.bigcommerce.com/solutions/headless-commerce/). \n\n**About BigCommerce**\n\nBigCommerce (Nasdaq: BIGC) is a leading open SaaS and composable ecommerce platform that empowers brands and retailers of all sizes to build, innovate and grow their businesses online.

Walsworth integrated with its pre-existing custom PIM and pre-existing custom OMS.\n\n\n\n**_Q4 and 2024 Financial Outlook:_**\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, we currently expect:\n\n  * Total revenue between $85.8 million to $87.8 million, implying a year-over-year growth rate of 2% to 4%.\n  * Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $4.4 million to $6.4 million.\n\n\n\nFor the full year 2024, we currently expect:\n\n  * Total revenue between $331.7 million and $333.7 million, translating into a year-over-year growth rate of 7% and 8%.\n  * Non-GAAP operating income between $13.8 million and $15.8 million.\n\n\n\nOur fourth quarter and 2024 financial outlook is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside our control. If actual results vary from these assumptions, our expectations may change. There can be no assurance that we will achieve these results.\n\nWe do not provide guidance for loss from operations , the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Non-GAAP operating income (loss), and similarly cannot provide a reconciliation between its forecasted Non-GAAP operating income (loss) and Non-GAAP income (loss) per share and these comparable GAAP measures without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates for certain items. These items are not within our control and may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nBigCommerce will host a conference call and webcast at 7:00 a.m. CT (8:00 a.m. ET) on Thursday, November 7, 2024, to discuss its financial results and business highlights.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “outlook,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “project,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “can,” “predict,” “potential,” “strategy,” “target,” “explore,” “continue,” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These statements may relate to our market size and growth strategy, our estimated and projected costs, margins, revenue, expenditures and customer and financial growth rates, our Q4 and fiscal 2024 financial outlook, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth, initiatives or strategies. By their nature, these statements are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including factors beyond our control, that could cause actual results, performance or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. These assumptions, uncertainties and risks include that, among others, the anticipated benefits and opportunities related to the 2024 Restructure may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, our ability to pay the interest and principal on our indebtedness depends upon cash flows generated by our operating performance, our business would be harmed by any decline in new customers, renewals or upgrades, our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future results of operations, we operate in competitive markets, we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future, our business would be harmed by any significant interruptions, delays or outages in services from our platform or certain social media platforms, and a cybersecurity-related attack, significant data breach or disruption of the information technology systems or networks could negatively affect our business. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the future quarterly and current reports that we file with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made and are based on information available to BigCommerce at the time those statements are made and/or management's good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events. BigCommerce assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, except as required by law.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe have provided in this press release certain financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Our management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believes that use of these Non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar Non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of our historical Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.\n\n**Annual Revenue Run-Rate**\n\nWe calculate annual revenue run-rate (“ARR”) at the end of each month as the sum of: (1) contractual monthly recurring revenue at the end of the period, which includes platform subscription fees, invoiced growth adjustments, feed management subscription fees, recurring professional services revenue, and other recurring revenue, multiplied by twelve to prospectively annualize recurring revenue, and (2) the sum of the trailing twelve-month non-recurring and variable revenue, which includes one-time partner integrations, one-time fees, payments revenue share, and any other revenue that is non-recurring and variable.\n\n**Enterprise Account Metrics**\n\nTo measure the effectiveness of our ability to execute against our growth strategy, particularly within the mid-market and enterprise business segments, we calculate ARR attributable to Enterprise Accounts. We define Enterprise Accounts as accounts with at least one unique Enterprise plan subscription or an enterprise level feed management subscription. These accounts may have more than one Enterprise plan or a combination of Enterprise plans and Essentials plans.\n\n**Average Revenue Per Account**\n\nWe calculate average revenue per account (ARPA) for accounts in the Enterprise cohort at the end of a period by including customer-billed revenue and an allocation of partner and services revenue, where applicable. We allocate partner revenue, where applicable, primarily based on each customer’s share of GMV processed through that partner’s solution. For partner revenue that is not directly linked to customer usage of a partner’s solution, we allocate such revenue based on each customer’s share of total platform GMV. Each account’s partner revenue allocation is calculated by taking the account’s trailing twelve-month partner revenue, then dividing by twelve to create a monthly average to apply to the applicable period in order to normalize ARPA for seasonality.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as our net loss, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax costs, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition related costs, restructuring charges, depreciation, gain on convertible note extinguishment, interest income, interest expense, other expense, and our provision or benefit for income taxes. Acquisition related costs include contingent compensation arrangements entered into in connection with acquisitions and achieved earnout related to an acquisition.\n\nRestructuring charges include severance benefits, right-of-use asset impairments, lease termination gain, software impairments, and professional services costs.\n\nDepreciation includes depreciation expenses related to the Company's fixed assets.\n\nThe most directly comparable GAAP measure is net loss.\n\n**Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss)**\n\nWe define Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) as our GAAP Loss from operations, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax costs, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, and restructuring charges. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is our loss from operations.\n\n**Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss)**\n\nWe define Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) as our GAAP net loss, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and related payroll tax costs, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, restructuring charges, and gain on convertible notes extinguishment. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is our net loss.\n\n**Non-GAAP Basic and Dilutive Net Income (Loss) per Share**\n\nWe define Non-GAAP Basic Net Income (Loss) per Share as our Non-GAAP net income (loss), defined above, divided by our basic and diluted GAAP weighted average shares outstanding. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is our basic net loss per share.\n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nWe define Free Cash Flow as our GAAP cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities less our GAAP purchases of property and equipment (Capital Expenditures). The most directly comparable GAAP measure is our cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities.\n\n**Media Relations Contact**| **Investor Relations Contact**  \n---|---  \nBrad Hem| Tyler

The survey, which gathered insights from over 3,000 U.S. consumers, highlights the diverse shopping behaviors that are motivating consumers to purchase home goods, making it crucial for home furnishings brands to better understand how and where their customers prefer to shop. \n\n“Today’s home furnishings shoppers are more informed and selective than ever, blending in-store and online experiences to make confident purchase decisions,” said Melissa Dixon, director of brand and content marketing at BigCommerce. “These findings highlight the importance of a robust omnichannel strategy, complete with flexible payment options and highly personalized customer engagement—key drivers not only for boosting sales but also for fostering deep, long-term brand loyalty.” \n\nThe survey results reflect that a robust omnichannel strategy that blends both online and in-store shopping is the golden key for home furnishing brands to meet customer expectations, and remain competitive and resilient in a quickly evolving market. Meanwhile, promotions, emerging technology, sustainability and in-store experiences show potential for fostering long-term brand loyalty. \n\n**Where, What and How Consumers Prefer to Buy**\n\nWhile the pandemic fueled a surge in online shopping, its aftermath has recovered interest in traditional in-store experiences, with houseware retailers seeing steady foot traffic throughout 2023. In fact, 48% of consumers prefer to purchase home furnishings in-store, while 28% favor online shopping and 24% have no preference. \n\nDespite the majority favoring in-store purchases, more respondents prefer to find inspiration for how they furnish their home digitally, with home improvement shows (48%) and home decor websites and blogs (47%) more popular than in-store browsing (40%). However, when it comes to today’s digital touchpoints, social media (48%) reigns supreme in product discovery, likely because of the abundance of content available on platforms like Instagram and TikTok that have the power to inspire viewers. \n\nThe report also revealed that 66% of shoppers purchased bedroom essentials online, followed closely by home décor (56%) and storage solutions (49%). Online marketplaces and big-box store websites are also the favored choice for purchasing (54%), with most consumers opting to buy mid-priced items ($100 – $499) from these channels. It’s notable that shoppers prefer these channels over a brand’s direct website (39%). Big-box store promotions or features like Amazon’s free two-day shipping could drive this preference. \n\nFlexible return policies, such as free pickup services, provide the reassurance shoppers need to make a purchase. Over 60% of respondents said they were more likely to purchase from an online home furnishings brand that offers free return shipping, while no restocking fees (37%), extended return windows (36%) and return pickup services (34%) showed to be key factors most likely to influence an online furnishings purchase. \n\n**Buy Online, Pick Up in Store (BOPIS) is No Longer a Perk – But An Expectation**\n\nIn the past year, 69% of shoppers have used BOPIS, while 36% have used BOPIS 2-5 times. A whopping 80% of shoppers reported they purchased additional items when picking up orders, while a surprising 31% have never used BOPIS before, giving home furnishings brands new opportunities to drive more sales and increase repurchase rates. \n\nBig-ticket items respondents were more likely to purchase using BNPL are indoor furniture (42%), bedroom essentials (32%), outdoor furniture (28%) and home decor (26%). \n\n**Consumers Using Emerging Technologies Are More Confident in Their Purchases**\n\nWhile a majority of respondents (42%) have not used emerging technologies, 27% have used virtual showrooms, 24% tried augmented reality (AR) 3D displays, and 18% have taken advantage of in-store virtual reality (VR) installations to interact with, and view, products. It’s worth noting 47% of consumers reported more confidence in their purchasing decisions when utilizing these emerging technologies, indicating that consumers are poised to start relying on these new tools to inform their purchases as they become more integral in the shopping experience. \n\nOffering online AR preview placements can help shoppers better visualize products in their own homes. Similarly, VR tools can allow shoppers to explore a brand’s offerings through in-store installations or connecting their headsets to an online virtual showroom. Brand’s like [UPLIFT Desk](https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/uplift-desk/) gives shoppers the ability to view 3D configurations of their desks in their own homes to help them feel more comfortable with their purchase. \n\n“When you buy online, you don’t know what the product is going to look like in your space. As we move into a world with augmented reality, we’re able to build the tools and products that help a customer visualize and understand it,” explained Daniel Burrow, vice president of growth at UPLIFT Desk, a BigCommerce customer. \n\n**Promotions Channels and Types Heavily Influence Where Consumers Shop**\n\nA compelling promotion can often persuade consumers to switch from their preferred buying method. In fact, 82% of respondents who prefer in-store purchases will likely buy online when an online-only promotion is offered. Similarly, 76% of those who favor online shopping will likely purchase at a physical store if presented with an in-store-only promotion. \n\nIt’s worth noting that fewer online shoppers would switch to in-store shopping, even with a promotion. This is likely because many of these shoppers prefer the convenience of being able to purchase at any time of the day (43%). With 61% of in-store shoppers and 58% of online shoppers reporting promotions would attract them to try a different buying method, it would be worth home furnishing brands to consider prioritizing promotions such as percentage discounts, BOGO and free gifts with purchase to attract and retain customers. \n\nMeanwhile, email marketing remains the most effective promotional channel, with 55% of consumers preferring to receive promotions via email. \n\n**Sustainability Matters, But Not at Any Cost**\n\nAs more consumers prioritize going green, there is a growing preference for sustainable products. For instance, while 39% of respondents look to buy energy-efficient items and 34% look to buy products with minimal or recycled packaging, the majority of consumers are not willing to pay more than 10% extra for products that align with their sustainability preferences. Most are unwilling to pay any additional cost. \n\nTo attract eco-minded shoppers, home furnishings brands should explore cost-effective ways to incorporate sustainable practices into their products. Highlighting energy efficiency and environmentally friendly packaging on product pages and shipping materials can help differentiate them from competitors. A great example is [Molly Mutt](https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/molly-mutt/) who showcases their commitment to sustainability through a dedicated page on their ecommerce site, raising customer awareness of their green initiatives. \n\nFor home furnishings businesses to thrive in this challenging landscape, it’s crucial to understand how their audiences prefer to shop and what they value in a brand. With this insight, brands can make strategic adjustments to their business models that differentiate them from competitors. \n\nBigCommerce works with leading home, garden and furniture retailers including [Chair King](https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/chair-king/) Backyard Store, [Designerie](https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/designerie/), [Jennifer Taylor Home](https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/jennifer-taylor-home/), [Wovenbyrd](https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/wovenbyrd/) and [Burrow](https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/burrow/), who are leveraging these strategies to elevate their customer shopping experiences and accelerate growth. \n\n[Click here](https://www.bigcommerce.com/resources/reports/hgf-consumer-cdl-report/?utm_medium=pr&utm_source=comms&utm_campaign=dg_amer_all_all_acq_verti-test_hgf_ct_2024_q4_hgf-omni-report-press&utm_content=hgf-omni-report-press.) to download the full report and learn how your home and garden brand can captivate customers with a beautiful storefront that can help sell more, scale and convert.
