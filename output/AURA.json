We either wait for the disease to progress or treat with radiation, which leads to irreversible vision loss,” said Carol L. Shields, MD, Chief of the Ocular Oncology Service at Wills Eye Hospital and Professor of Ophthalmology at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. “If approved, bel-sar may represent the opportunity to treat choroidal melanoma at an earlier stage of medical intervention and set a new standard of care in a disease that has had no new therapies approved for decades.”\n\n**Recent Pipeline Developments**\n\n**_Early-Stage Choroidal Melanoma_** Early-stage choroidal melanoma represents an area of high unmet need with no drugs approved. The Company previously received Orphan Drug Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Fast Track designation from the FDA for the treatment of early-stage choroidal melanoma.\n\n**Update on Ongoing Phase 3 CoMpass Trial:** CoMpass is the first registration-enabling study in early-stage choroidal melanoma. The study is a global, Phase 3, randomized trial evaluating bel-sar treatment against a sham control arm and includes an enrichment strategy to enroll 100 patients with documented growth, an approach agreed upon under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement with the FDA.\n\n  * The Company recently received authorization from the EMA to commence the trial under the European Union (EU) Clinical Trial Regulation (CTR) process. This approval was later than anticipated due to a requirement for additional testing to support drug substance characterization that has been successfully met. This authorization permits the Company to start enrolling patients in the study in the EU. The study started enrolling in the United States in December 2023 and currently has sites activated in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada.\n  * To identify appropriate patients to meet the enrichment strategy of documented growth, the Company has enabled a pre-screening ‘run in’ period. Globally, since June 2024, investigators have registered over 100 patients in pre-screening as having met initial enrollment criteria for the study. The Company continues to monitor the overall timeline for the study, with European sites in the process of being activated.\n\n\n\n**The Company**[**announced**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SOrkyOHkVHkmvkocQghyDXNS0kTJMB8j1OQZ6pPCvIJsfOTqW0X1vlhktVxksCCagG53b8hJCaoO2DdajEub4mydGf-vdRfrvGCJVA6Bs-vr-eRQMP_EZ4V3MIrRH-fvdk5RPwIcYrD0xge1TdkKv7oYkMUoJj7SW9fv_tglHbsChwLQ5Uw6i_OOWDgSTjr7NuCgwhYFyEY4_-SayuDmqw==)**positive Phase 2 end of study results evaluating bel-sar as a first-line treatment for early-stage choroidal melanoma.**\n\n**Clinical Data:** The Phase 2 results demonstrated that bel-sar achieved an 80% tumor control rate (n=8/10) and durability of response at 12 months among Phase 3-eligible patients who received the therapeutic regimen. Visual acuity preservation was achieved in 90% of these patients. We believe the Phase 2 results are a significant achievement that support the design of the ongoing Phase 3 trial.\n\n**Safety Data:** The safety profile of bel-sar was highly favorable in all participants. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events reported. Ocular treatment-related adverse events were mild (Grade 1).\n\n**_Additional Ocular Oncology Indications_** _:_\n\nIn addition to early-stage choroidal melanoma, bel-sar is being explored for metastases to the choroid and cancers of the ocular surface. These three ocular oncology indications have a collective incidence of greater than 60,000 patients annually in the United States and Europe.\n\n_Metastases to the Choroid_\n\nThe Company is initiating clinical development for bel-sar as a potential treatment for metastases to the choroid, an indication with high unmet medical need and no approved therapies. The Company aims to enroll the first patients in a Phase 2 trial in 2024. Metastases to the choroid represents the second potential ocular oncology indication for bel-sar, affecting approximately 20,000 patients annually in the United States and Europe. The Company previously received FDA Fast Track designation for bel-sar as a treatment in this indication.\n\n_Cancers of the Ocular Surface_\n\nThe Company’s third potential ocular oncology indication is cancers of the ocular surface, which affect approximately 35,000 patients in the United States and Europe annually. The Company continues to advance its preclinical work designed to be IND-enabling in cancers of the ocular surface.\n\n**_Bladder Cancer_**\n\nThe Company [announced](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SOrkyOHkVHkmvkocQghyDfxaW9MJ49yVxOR0MqxB6A6kSkIfHokSCXYT0-10golNALTdtm8Ei1je0bsbZfObKLJ8eXyX97hBa9Wb20ng1s0x81iUm4L3j09YBccpUDkX2nDQ4wWPLTGIhdtdpf_icxI3Qp8yEwB3qZe2D6NsswV8aqu3VGj3VdX8dard_VKzi587ZeWxZFp701lhxFfxdQ==) positive early data from an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of bel-sar in patients with NMIBC.\n\n**Clinical Data:** In these early data from the first 8 patients treated with a single low dose of bel-sar with light activation, a clinical complete response was observed in 4 out of 5 patients with low grade disease; visual tumor shrinkage was observed on cystoscopy in 2 out of 3 patients with high grade disease where tumor cells were still present on histopathological evaluation. For this analysis, clinical complete response was defined as the absence of tumor cells on histopathologic evaluation. In addition, immune activation was noted in all patients with available immune staining in both treated target and untreated non-target bladder tumors with rapid infiltration of effector CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells within days after treatment. This data provides evidence of a bladder urothelial field effect, potentially indicating a broader immune response in the bladder beyond the target tumor in these patients.\n\n**Safety Data:** In the safety analysis as of the September 9, 2024 data cut-off date (n=12), bel-sar was well-tolerated, with less than 10% Grade 1 and no Grade 2 or higher drug-related adverse events reported. No serious adverse events have been reported.\n\n**Future Development :** The Company plans to continue development of bel-sar in bladder cancer with an initial focus on low-grade, intermediate risk NMIBC patients, through a planned trial expansion to test additional doses and treatment regimens with the opportunity to assess early durability of response at 3 months. In parallel, the Company is planning regulatory discussions on the design of the next trial with the goal of expediting clinical development in this patient population.\n\n**Recent Corporate Events**\n\n  * The Company announced the appointment of Sabine Doris Brookman-May, MD, FEBU as the Company’s Senior Vice President, Therapeutic Area Head Urologic Oncology.\n  * The Company hosted a virtual ocular oncology investor event featuring Ivana Kim, MD (Mass Eye and Ear) and Prithvi Mruthyunjaya, MD, MHS (Stanford University Byers Eye Institute) to discuss the Phase 2 end of study data on Thursday, September 12, 2024. A replay of the webcast is available on the “Investors & Media” page under the “Events & Presentations” section of Aura’s website at <https://ir.aurabiosciences.com/events-and-presentations>.\n  * The Company hosted a virtual urologic oncology investor event featuring Max Kates, MD (Johns Hopkins), Joe Jacob, MD (Syracuse University), Neal Shore, MD (Carolina Urologic Research Center) and Gary Steinberg, MD (RUSH University) to discuss the early Phase 1 data on Thursday, October 17, 2024. A replay of the webcast is available on the “Investors & Media” page under the “Events & Presentations” section of Aura’s website at <https://ir.aurabiosciences.com/events-and-presentations>.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $174.4 million. The Company believes its current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are sufficient to fund its operations into the second half of 2026.\n  * Research and development expenses increased to $17.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $15.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to manufacturing and development costs for bel-sar and higher personnel expenses related to growth of the Company.\n  * General and administrative expenses increased to $6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $5.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses include $1.6 million and $1.2 million of stock-based compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by personnel expenses, as well as increases in general corporate expenses related to the growth of the Company.\n  * Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $21.0 million compared to $18.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Aura Biosciences**\n\nAura Biosciences is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing precision therapies for solid tumors that aim to preserve organ function.

(NASDAQ: AURA), today announced positive early data from an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of bel-sar (AU-011) in patients with NMIBC. To date, the trial includes 13 patients, with the primary endpoints of evaluating the safety and feasibility of local administration of bel-sar alone (n=5) and bel-sar with light activation (n=8). The secondary endpoints are to evaluate biological activity and immune mediated changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME). 10 of 13 study participants had low grade disease, approximating the 70% incidence of this patient population among all NMIBC patients. The other 3 study participants had high grade disease. In patients receiving bel-sar with light activation (n=8), 4 out of 5 patients with low grade disease demonstrated a clinical complete response with no tumor cells remaining on histopathological evaluation. 2 out of 3 patients with high grade disease demonstrated visual tumor shrinkage observed on cystoscopy. Aura will host a [Virtual Urologic Oncology Investor Event](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=uMXCav-kx5a1U2i6Ul1-qirtsZ3sRnyJAfxMmsMa1W_8k2s_85vrGswQpGMEqqtfHe1-kpSwMPDfIl38Ft8V3SJsbSstmaMhLFo44kA-D0oLy0FYQ_yFZPYGTwiJyz4taktig8gj9I9uMjYwV43sEA==) at 4:30 pm ET today.\n\n“We are highly encouraged by this positive early data, which shows that bel-sar has the potential to be a transformative cancer treatment,” said Sabine Brookman-May, MD, FEBU, Senior Vice President, Therapeutic Area Head Urologic Oncology of Aura Biosciences. “A potentially differentiating aspect of this novel treatment is the rapid tumor response accompanied by an immune oncology (IO) effect such as a marked CD8+ T-cell infiltration observed in just a matter of days with a single low dose. We believe this could have the potential to translate into a durable response. In parallel with expanding the ongoing Phase 1 trial, we are preparing for a Phase 2 trial to further evaluate bel-sar’s clinical activity and durability of response.”\n\n“Bel-sar has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for NMIBC,” said Neal Shore, MD, FACS, Medical Director, Carolina Urologic Research Center, AUC Urology Specialists. “Based on this early data, bel-sar’s positive clinical activity and evidence of a bladder urothelial field effect with a single dose, may position bel-sar to be the first immune ablative treatment option for early-stage bladder cancer patients delivered with an in-office procedure.”\n\nBel-sar is a virus-like drug conjugate, designed to have a dual mechanism of action, that induces direct tumor cell necrosis and elicits a robust and durable anti-tumor immune response.\n\n**Trial Design:** The ongoing Phase 1 trial ([NCT05483868](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=--3lMxqEL9OICuPbX1ZIUAYWWdQxbQoZD66PS1UCnm61aNb2EGyQqGp6RoyBjf9FhdMgnfof2tSEqXTD0FjZwzGea4njY2WsceDNNYnpaL2e_c-qO9qmTm80IVwR5La0EhUVibySulI_-7upM2tGdw==)) is a two-part, open-label clinical trial, designed to assess the safety and feasibility of bel-sar as a monotherapy. The study treatment is administered 7 to 12 days before the scheduled transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), the standard of care procedure. The participants are followed for safety monitoring over a 56-day period. The trial is also evaluating bel-sar’s biological activity with histopathological evaluation of tissue samples collected at the time of TURBT (regardless of tumor response) with evaluation of focal necrosis and immune changes in the tumor microenvironment. Part 1 (n=5) of the trial is complete, with patients receiving a single bel-sar dose without light activation. Part 2 (n=10) of the trial is ongoing. 8 patients with a confirmed tumor at time of treatment have received either 100ug or 200ug of bel-sar as a single dose. Of these 8 patients, 5 had low grade disease and 3 had high grade disease. 7 of these 8 patients had a history of recurrent bladder cancer and had undergone multiple TURBTs and adjuvant treatments such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), mitomycin, gemcitabine, cetrelimab and tamoxifen prior to trial enrollment. In the Phase 1 trial expansion, Aura plans to test additional doses and treatment regimens.\n\n**Safety Data:** In the safety analysis as of the September 9, 2024 data cut-off date (n=12), bel-sar was well-tolerated, with less than 10% of patients reporting Grade 1 and no Grade 2 or higher drug-related adverse events reported. No serious adverse events have been reported. No significant differences between the light-activated and non-light activated cohorts have been observed.\n\n**Biological Activity:** The data in these 8 patients receiving bel-sar with light activation showed clinical activity detectable as soon as 7 days after a single low dose of bel-sar with light activation. This was demonstrated by histopathological evidence of clinical complete response, necrosis, immune activation or visual tumor shrinkage observed on cystoscopy. For this analysis, “clinical complete response” was defined as the absence of tumor cells on histopathologic evaluation. Of the patients with low-grade disease, 4 out of 5 exhibited a clinical complete response (1 of 4 based on local pathology with central review ongoing), with no tumor cells detected in histopathological evaluation post-treatment in the target and in several non-target bladder tumors. 2 of 3 of the patients with high grade disease demonstrated visual tumor shrinkage observed on cystoscopy, while tumor cells were still present on histopathological evaluation. Immune activation was noted in all patients in both treated target and untreated non-target bladder tumors with infiltration of effector CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells (where immune staining was available). This data provides evidence of a bladder urothelial field effect with a single low dose of bel-sar with light activation, potentially indicating a broader immune response in the bladder beyond the target tumor in these patients.\n\n**Aura Virtual Urologic Oncology Investor Event**\n\nAura will host a Virtual Urologic Oncology Investor Event featuring Max Kates, MD (Johns Hopkins), Joe Jacob, MD (Syracuse University), Neal Shore, MD (Carolina Urologic Research Center) and Gary Steinberg, MD (RUSH University) to discuss the early Phase 1 data on Thursday, October 17, 2024, at 4:30 pm Eastern Time.
