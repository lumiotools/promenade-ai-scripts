Words such as, but not limited to, “look forward to,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “would,” “should,” and “could,” and similar expressions or words,\nidentify forward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on management’s current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and important factors that may cause\nactual events or results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation, including, without limitation, risks relating to: (i) unforeseen\ndelays in clinical trial enrollment or other activities that may affect the timing and success of our current and anticipated clinical trials, (ii) the fact that preliminary data from a clinical study may not be\npredictive of the final results of such study or the results of other ongoing or future studies or trials, (iii) our ability to obtain and maintain FDA approval to commercialize gedatolisib, and the market\nacceptance of a commercialized product, (iv) our ability to raise additional capital for further product development and other activities, (v) the development of products or services competitive with our\nproducts, including without limitation, other effective drug candidates, diagnostic tests and treatment options, (vi) our dependence on intellectual property licenses and other third-party relationships, (vii) our\nability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our technology and time and expense associated with defending third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, investigations or\nlitigation threatened or initiated against us, (viii) difficulties we may face in managing growth, such as hiring and retaining a qualified sales force and attracting and retaining key personnel, and (ix)\nuncertainties and assumptions regarding the impact of macro-economic conditions and global risks on our business, operations, clinical trials, supply chain, strategy, goals and anticipated timelines.\nBecause forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond our control, you should not rely on\nthese forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. In our reports and filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we present more\ninformation about the risks and uncertainties applicable to our business. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all risks and uncertainties. Except as\nrequired by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances\nor otherwise.\nThe information in this presentation does not provide full disclosure of all material facts relating to Celcuity, its securities or the proposed offering of its securities. This presentation shall not constitute an\noffer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities.\n2\nThe Celcuity Opportunity\nSignificant untapped potential to effectively treat PAM pathway involved cancers\n1\n• Gedatolisib’s differentiated MOA and PK profile result in a highly potent, cytotoxic, and well tolerated PAM inhibitor\n• Very compelling data in 1L (mPFS 48 months) and 2L (mPFS 12.9 months) patients with HR+/HER2- ABC\n2\n• A Phase 3 study in 2L patients is enrolling and a Phase 3 study in 1L patients is expected to begin enrolling in Q2 2025\n3 • Strong scientific rationale to develop gedatolisib for prostate cancer indications\n• Parallels between breast and prostate cancer – interdependent activity between PAM pathway and hormonal pathways\n4 • Uniquely positioned to advance multiple potential blockbuster indications in breast and prostate cancer\n• Pro forma cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $264M as of Q3 expected to fund operations through 2026\n3\nUnlocking the Potential of Treating Cancers\nThat Involve the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway\nLargest untapped drug\nOne of the most important Most highly altered of all\ndevelopment opportunity\noncogenic pathways signaling pathways1\nin solid tumors\nPI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) Proportion of alterations Breast and prostate cancers\nregulates key metabolic correlates to pathway’s role involve PAM pathway\nfunctions as a cancer driver\n• >500,000 addressable patient\n• Plays a key role promoting population in US, 5EU, and Japan\nPAM 38%\ntumor cell proliferation\n• Nominal penetration of PAM drugs\nRAS 15%\n• Cross-regulates other oncogenic in these markets\npathways\nHER2 8%\n• Affects immune response by\nEGFR 5%\nregulating tumor microenvironment\n(1) cBioPortal References:Cerami et al., Cancer Discov. 2012, and Gao et al., Sci.
