          "content": "3Q24\nShareholder\nLetter\nTo Our AppLovin\nShareholders:\nWe had another fantastic quarter in Q3. Our AXON models continue to improve through self-\nlearning and, more importantly this quarter, from technology enhancements by our engineering\nteam. As we continue to improve our models our advertising partners are able to successfully spend\nat a greater scale. We're proud to be a catalyst to reinvigorating growth in our industry.\nIn the third quarter, we generated revenue of $1.20 billion (+39% year-over-year), net income of\n$434 million (+300% year-over-year) at a net margin of 36%, and Adjusted EBITDA of $722 million\n(+72% year-over-year) at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 60%. We generated net cash from\noperating activities of $551 million (+177% year-over-year) and Free Cash Flow of $545 million\n(+182% year-over-year). At the end of 3Q24, we had $568 million in cash and cash equivalents and\n335 million shares of our Class A and Class B common stock outstanding.\nOur Software Platform revenue grew in the third quarter to $835 million (+66% year-over-year) and\nSoftware Platform Adjusted EBITDA expanded to $653 million (+79% year-over-year) at an Adjusted\nEBITDA margin of 78%.\nDuring the third quarter, we retired and withheld a total of 5.0 million shares of our Class A\ncommon stock for a total cost of $437 million1. Given our confidence in AppLovin's future, our\nboard of directors has increased our share repurchase authorization by an incremental $2.0 billion,\nincreasing our total aggregate remaining authorization to $2.3 billion, with future repurchases to be\nfunded from Free Cash Flow.\nWe believe a strong capital structure and effective capital allocation plan are crucial to the creation\nof long-term shareholder value. To achieve this goal, we are focused on:\n• Investing in top talent and technology to drive organic growth;\n• Managing share capital through ongoing share repurchases funded from Free Cash Flow and\nprudent equity grants to employees; and\n• Building a strong capital foundation with sufficient liquidity to support financial flexibility and\na net debt leverage ratio below 2.0x.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2024, our outlook is as follows:\nFinancial Guidance Summary2\n4Q24\nTotal Revenue $1,240 to $1,260 million\nAdjusted EBITDA $740 to $760 million\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin 60%\n1\nIncludes repurchased shares as well as withholdings upon net share settlement of vested equity awards. Total cost includes repurchase costs, including commissions and fees, as well\nas cash paid in connection with tax withholding and remittance obligations upon net share settlement.\n2\nWe have not provided the forward-looking GAAP equivalents for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, or a GAAP\nreconciliation as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of\nthese non-GAAP guidance metrics to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to\nreconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. We have provided historical reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics in tables at the end of this letter.\nAppLovin Corporation / 3Q24 Shareholder Letter 2\n3Q24\nFinancial Overview\nALL COMPARISONS ARE TO 3Q23 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.\nNet Income was $434 million, a net margin of 36%\nRevenue was $1.20 billion, an increase of 39%.\ncompared to a net income of $109 million and a net\nmargin of 13%.\nSoftware Platform revenue grew 66% to $835 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 72% to $722 million, an\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA increased 79% to\nAdjusted EBITDA margin of 60%.\n$653 million, a 78% Adjusted EBITDA margin.\nApps revenue grew 1% to $363 million.

Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures in the Appendix.\nSoftware Platform Update\nOur Software Platform segment continued to grow in the third quarter, with Software Platform\nrevenue of $835 million, up 66% year-over-year, driven by continued development of our AXON\nengine through ongoing self-learning and directed model enhancements. These technology\nenhancements allowed our advertising partners to further increase the scale of their spend on our\nplatform while consistently achieving their return on ad spend (\"ROAS\") goals.\nSoftware Platform Adjusted EBITDA grew 79% year-over-year to $653 million at an Adjusted\nEBITDA margin of 78% reflecting continued management of operating leverage as we scale. As we\nhave noted in the past, our margins for this business will fluctuate on a quarterly basis, primarily\ndriven by our investment in infrastructure as we continue to scale and secure data center capacity to\nsupport future growth.\nOur core advertising business now represents substantially all of our Software Platform revenue and\nfuture focus for the company. Starting with our next shareholder letter and Annual Report on SEC\nForm 10-K, we will rename our “Software” Platform and associated revenue to “Advertising” to\nbetter align with the nature of this business.\nSoftware Platform Revenue Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA\n($ millions) ($ millions, as % revenue)\n$835 $653\n$711\n$678 $520\n$492\n$576\n$420\n$504\n$364\n78%\n72% 73% 73% 73%\n3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24\nApps Update\nIn the third quarter, our Apps segment revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $363 million while our\nApps Adjusted EBITDA was $68 million at an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 19%.

Forward-looking\nstatements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In\nsome cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as\n“may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “going to,” “could,” “intend,” “target,”\n“project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the\nnegative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations,\nstrategy, priorities, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this letter to shareholders\ninclude, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future financial performance, including our\nexpected financial results and guidance, and growth prospects; statements regarding our share\nrepurchase program, including any future authorized increases to the amount available under our\nprogram; our long-term goals; our expectations regarding improvements to our AXON technology;\nour expectations regarding trends impacting our Software Platform; our expectations regarding the\nbenefits of our Software Platform to and the growth of our advertising partners; our expectations\nregarding the growth of our advertising partners, the growth of advertising spending and the\nadvertising ecosystem; our expectations regarding our capital allocation plans; our expectations on\nour cost management efforts, as well as, our plans for user acquisition spend in our Apps segment.\nOur ability to increase the amount authorized under our share repurchase program, and to utilize\nany amounts authorized, will depend on a variety of factors, including compliance with legal\nrequirements, such as solvency and surplus requirements; contractual restrictions, as may be set\nforth in our credit facility or any future debt or other applicable agreements; market conditions; our\ncapital allocation strategy; and our other capital requirements from time to time, including any\nstrategic acquisitions and partnerships we may undertake. Over time, we may modify our capital\nallocation strategy or pursue alternative objectives and strategies. Our expectations and beliefs\nregarding our share repurchase program and the other forward looking statements contained in this\nletter may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties,\nincluding changes in our plans or assumptions, which could cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom those projected. These risks include our inability to forecast our business effectively, the\nmacroeconomic environment, fluctuations in our results of operations, our ability to execute on our\noperational and financial priorities, our ability to scale our Software Platform to support new users\nor verticals, our ability to continue to develop our AXON technology as well as expand into new\nsupply and demand verticals, the competitive advertising and mobile app ecosystems, and our\ninability to adapt to emerging technologies and business models. The forward-looking statements\ncontained in this letter are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully\ndescribed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024.\nAdditional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal\nquarter ended September 30, 2024. The forward-looking statements in this letter are based on\ninformation available to us as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update any\nforward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nAppLovin Corporation / 3Q24 Shareholder Letter 6\nNon-GAAP Financial Metrics\nTo supplement our financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this shareholder letter includes certain financial\nmeasures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted\nEBITDA margin, and Free Cash Flow. A reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to\nthe most directly comparable GAAP measure can be found below.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income before interest expense and loss\non settlement of debt, interest income and other, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision\nfor income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for non-\noperating foreign exchange (gains) losses, stock-based compensation expense, transaction-related\nexpense and transaction bonuses, restructuring costs, impairment and loss in connection with sale\nof long-lived assets, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration,\nlease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, change in the fair value of\ncontingent consideration, and loss on disposal of long lived assets. We define Adjusted EBITDA\nmargin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period.\nWe define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property\nand equipment and principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property\nand equipment and payment of finance leases in our calculation of Free Cash Flow because we\nbelieve these items represent our ongoing requirements for property and equipment to support our\nbusiness, regardless of whether we utilize a finance lease to obtain such property or equipment.\nWe believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information\nto investors regarding our results of operations and operating performance, as they are similar to\nmeasures reported by our public competitors and are regularly used by securities analysts,\ninstitutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and\nprospects.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial\nperformance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties\nbecause they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations\nacross our historical financial periods. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in\nconjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including\nthe preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the\neffectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning\nour financial performance. We use Free Cash Flow in addition to GAAP measures to help manage\nour business and prepare budgets and annual planning, and we believe Free Cash Flow provides\nuseful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and\nour liquidity.\nThese measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses\nthat are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our\nbusiness. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore\ncomparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics.\nThus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for,\nor in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAppLovin Corporation / 3Q24 Shareholder Letter 7\nKey Metrics\nWe review the following key metrics on a regular basis to evaluate the health of our business,\nidentify trends affecting our performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic\ndecisions.\nQuarterly Key Metrics\nMonthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one\nof our apps in a month that completed at least one In-App Purchases (IAP) during that time\nperiod. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate apps on the same mobile device in\na monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer\nthan one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We estimate the\nnumber of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. We\nestimate that our counted MAPs generated substantially all of our IAP revenue during the\nthree months ending September 30, 2024, and as such, management believes that MAPs are\na useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games.\nAverage Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i) the\ntotal IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that\nsame period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average\nARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are\nmonetizing each MAP.\n3Q 2024 3Q 2023\nMonthly Active Payers (millions) 1.6 1.8\nAverage Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) $52 $46\nOur key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily\ncalculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other\ncompanies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from\nsimilarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we\nuse to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on\nwhat we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the applicable period of\nmeasurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly\nreview and may adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.\nAppLovin Corporation / 3Q24 Shareholder Letter 8\nAppLovin Corporation\nCondensed

Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or\noperating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,”\n“expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the\nnegative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking\nstatements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include statements about:\n•our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our revenue, cost of revenue, and operating expenses, and our\nability to achieve or maintain future profitability;\n•the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents to meet our liquidity needs;\n•our ability to maintain the security and availability of our AppLovin Software Platform and AppLovin Apps;\n•our expectations regarding the effects of existing and developing laws and regulations, including with respect to taxation, privacy, data\nprotection and AI;\n•our ability to attract and retain employees and key personnel;\n•our expectations regarding the macroeconomic environment, inflation and high interest rates, uncertainty in the global banking and\nfinancial services markets, political uncertainty and international conflicts around the world;\n•our ability to successfully expand our AI capabilities to support the further development of our Software Platform, including our\nadvertising recommendation engine, AXON;\n•our ability to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property;\n•our ability to manage risk associated with our business;\n•the demand for our AppLovin Software Platform and AppLovin Apps;\n•our expectations concerning relationships with third parties;\n•our ability to attract and retain clients and users;\n•our ability to develop new products, features, and enhancements for our AppLovin Software Platform and to launch or acquire new\nAppLovin Apps and successfully monetize them;\n•our ability to compete with existing and new competitors in existing and new markets and offerings;\n•our ability to successfully expand into new markets;\n•our ability to successfully acquire and integrate companies and assets and to expand and diversify our operations through strategic\nacquisitions and partnerships;\n•our expectations regarding new and evolving markets;\n•our expectations and management of future growth;\n•our expectations regarding our share repurchase program, including future amounts available for repurchase; and\n•our ability to develop and protect our brand.\nWe caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements\ncontained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we\nbelieve may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-\nlooking statements is subject to\n1\nTable of contents\nrisks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time\nand it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We cannot assure you that the results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements\nwill be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking\nstatements.\nNeither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any of these forward-looking statements.\nMoreover, the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the\nstatements are made.

We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-\nlooking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect\nthe potential impact of any future acquisitions, partnerships, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, or investments we may make.\nIn addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements\nare based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe such information forms a\nreasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we\nhave conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information.

Consolidated Financial Statements\n(unaudited)\n1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nAppLovin Corporation (the “Company” or “AppLovin”) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 18, 2011. The Company is a\nleader in the advertising ecosystem providing an end-to-end software platform that allows businesses to reach, monetize and grow their global\naudiences. The Company also has a globally diversified portfolio of apps—free-to-play mobile games that it operates through its studios.\nThe Company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and has several operating locations in the U.S. as well as various international\noffice locations in North America, Asia, and Europe.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim\nfinancial reporting. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP\nhave been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Therefore, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\nshould be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form\n10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024. The condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the\naudited consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The accompanying unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments, that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for\nthe fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stockholders’ equity for the interim periods\npresented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 shown in this report are not necessarily indicative\nof the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024 or any other period.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe Company's condensed consolidated financial statements include accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned\nsubsidiaries, and the ownership interest of minority investors is recorded as noncontrolling interest. In accordance with the provisions of\nAccounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 810, Consolidation, the Company is also required to consolidate any variable interest entities (\"VIE\")\nwhen it is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the\nVIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, or the right to receive\nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company evaluates its relationships with all VIEs on an ongoing basis.\nAll intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an\nongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to fair values of assets and liabilities acquired\nthrough acquisitions, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, expected period of consumption of virtual goods, income and\nindirect taxes, contingent liabilities, evaluation of recoverability of intangible assets and other long-lived assets, goodwill impairment, stock-based\ncompensation, fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results\ncould differ materially from those estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements (Issued Not Yet Adopted)\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-07, Segment\nReporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and\ninterim basis. The amendments will be effective for fiscal\n10\nTable of contents\nyears beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments must be\napplied retrospectively, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's\ndisclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires\ndisaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The amendments will be effective for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments may be applied prospectively or retrospectively, and early adoption is permitted. The\nCompany is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.\n2. Revenue\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nThe Company generates Software Platform and Apps revenue. Software Platform revenue is generated primarily from fees collected from\nadvertisers and advertising networks who use the Software Platform. Apps revenue consists of in-app purchase (\"IAP\") revenue generated from\nin-app purchases made by users within the Company’s apps (“Apps”), and in-app advertising (\"IAA\") revenue generated from advertisers that\npurchase ad inventory from Apps.\nSoftware Platform Revenue\nThe vast majority of the Software Platform Revenue is generated through AppDiscovery and MAX, which provide the technology to match\nadvertisers and owners of digital advertising inventory (“Publishers”) via auctions at large scale and microsecond-level speeds. The terms for all\nmobile advertising arrangements are governed by the Company’s terms and conditions and generally stipulate payment terms of 30 days\nsubsequent to the end of the month. Substantially all of the Company's contracts with customers are fully cancellable at any time or upon short\nnotice.\nThe Company’s performance obligation is to provide customers with access to the Software Platform, which facilitates the advertiser’s\npurchase of ad inventory from Publishers. The Company does not control the ad inventory prior to its transfer to the advertiser, because the\nCompany does not have the substantive ability to direct the use of nor obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the ad inventory.\nThe Company is not primarily responsible for fulfillment and does not have any inventory risk. The Company is an agent as it relates to the sale\nof third-party advertising inventory and presents revenue on a net basis. The transaction price is the product of either the number of completions\nof agreed upon actions or advertisements displayed and the contractually agreed upon price per advertising unit with the advertiser less\nconsideration paid or payable to Publishers. The Company recognizes Software Platform Revenue when the agreed upon action is completed or\nwhen the ad is displayed to users. The number of advertisements delivered and completions of agreed upon actions is determined at the end of\neach month, which resolves any uncertainty in the transaction price during the reporting period.\nSoftware Platform Revenue also includes revenue generated from Adjust's measurement and analytics marketing platform that is\nrecognized ratably over the subscription period, generally up to twelve months. Revenue from other services within the Software Platform was\nnot material.\nApps Revenue\nIn-App Purchase Revenue\nIAP Revenue includes fees collected from users to purchase virtual goods to enhance their gameplay experience. The identified\nperformance obligation is to provide users with the ability to acquire, use, and hold virtual items over the estimated period of time the virtual\nitems are available to the user or until the virtual item is consumed. Payment is required at the time of purchase, and the purchase price is a\nfixed amount.\nUsers make IAPs through the Company’s distribution partners. The transaction price is equal to the gross amount charged to users\nbecause the Company is the principal in the transaction. IAP fees are non-refundable. Such payments are initially recorded as deferred revenue.\nThe Company categorizes its virtual goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed\nby a specific player action in gameplay; accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods\nare consumed. Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the user over an extended period of time; accordingly, the Company\nrecognizes revenue from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the user, which is generally\nthe estimated average user life (“EAUL”).\nThe EAUL represents the Company’s best estimate of the expected life of paying users for the applicable game. The EAUL begins when a\nuser makes the first purchase of durable virtual goods and ends when a user is\n11\nTable of contents\ndetermined to be inactive. The Company determines the EAUL on a game-by-game basis. For a newly launched game with limited playing data,\nthe Company determines its EAUL based on the EAUL of a game with sufficiently similar characteristics.\nThe Company determines the EAUL on a quarterly basis and applies such calculated EAUL to all bookings in the respective quarter.\nDetermining the EAUL is subjective and requires management’s judgment. Future playing patterns may differ from historical playing patterns,\nand therefore the EAUL may change in the future. The EAULs are generally between five and ten months.\nIn-App Advertising Revenue\nIAA Revenue is generated by selling ad inventory on the Company's Apps to third-party advertisers. Advertisers purchase ad inventory\neither through the Software Platform or through third-party advertising networks (“Ad Networks”). Revenue from the sale of ad inventory through\nAd Networks is recognized net of the amounts retained by Ad Networks as the Company is unable to determine the gross amount paid by the\nadvertisers to Ad Networks. The Company recognizes revenue when the ad is displayed to users.\nThe Company presents taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table presents revenue disaggregated by segment and type (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSoftware Platform Revenue $ 835,186 $ 504,452 $ 2,224,571 $ 1,265,273\nIn-App Purchase Revenue 246,344 247,309 756,110 732,262\nIn-App Advertising Revenue 116,705 112,495 355,788 332,291\nTotal Apps Revenue 363,049 359,804 1,111,898 1,064,553\nTotal Revenue $ 1,198,235 $ 864,256 $ 3,336,469 $ 2,329,826\nRevenue disaggregated by geography, based on user location, consists of the following (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUnited States $ 657,778 $ 500,586 $ 1,923,885 $ 1,393,625\nRest of the World 540,457 363,670 1,412,584 936,201\nTotal Revenue $ 1,198,235 $ 864,256 $ 3,336,469 $ 2,329,826\nContract Balances\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue, which are recorded for payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance\nobligations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $41.6 million and $48.4 million of revenue\nthat was included in deferred revenue as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nthe Company recognized $76.2 million and $62.5 million of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nUnsatisfied Performance Obligations\nSubstantially all of the Company’s unsatisfied performance obligations relate to contracts with an original expected length of one year or\nless.\n3. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities Measured at Net Asset Value\nThe Company held equity interests in certain private equity funds of $78.9 million and $56.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively, which are measured using the net asset value practical expedient. Under the net asset value practical\nexpedient, the Company records investments based on the proportionate share of the underlying funds’ net asset value as of the Company's\nreporting date. These investments are included in other assets in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThese funds vary in investment strategies and generally have an initial term of 7 to 10 years, which may be\n12\nTable of contents\nextended for 2 to 3 additional years with the applicable approval. These investments are subject to certain restrictions regarding transfers and\nwithdrawals and generally cannot be redeemed with the funds. Distributions from the funds will be received as the underlying investments are\nliquidated. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of these investments of $78.9 million and the unfunded\ncommitments of $22.2 million as of September 30, 2024.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made total capital contributions of $0.7 million and $19.0\nmillion, respectively, related to these investments. No material unrealized gain or loss was recorded related to these investments for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024. The unrealized gains related to these investments were $2.3 million and $7.3 million for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe Company's non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The\nCompany elected the measurement alternative to account for these investments. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value of the\nnon-marketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same\nissuer or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income, net in the Company's condensed consolidated\nstatement of operations.\nIn February 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to invest $50.0 million in the Series C preferred stock financing of Humans,\nInc., the developer of the Flip Shop social shopping app (\"Flip Shop\"), of which $10.0 million was closed in February 2024 and the remaining\n$40.0 million was closed in April 2024. In February 2024, the Company also entered into an arm's length commercial agreement with Flip Shop\nrelated to its use of the Company's AXON technology under a revenue share model.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the Company purchased certain additional non-marketable equity securities for a total of $8.0 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amounts of the Company's non-marketable equity securities were\n$68.1 million and $10.1 million, respectively, and were included in other assets in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n4. Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company's non-cancelable minimum purchase commitment was primarily related to a multi-year\ncontractual arrangement with a cloud services provider. In August 2024, the Company amended its agreement with the cloud services provider.\nUnder the amended agreement, the Company committed to spend a minimum of $1.26 billion over a three-year period. As of September 30,\n2024, no payment had been made towards this commitment. In addition, the Company had total unfunded commitments of $22.2 million related\nto investments in certain private equity funds. For additional information, see Note 3 – Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business activities. The\nCompany accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that future expenditures will be made, and such expenditures can be reasonably\nestimated.\nLetters of Credit\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $6.3 million\nand $6.3 million, respectively, which were issued as security for certain leased office facilities under the Credit Agreement. These letters of credit\nhave never been drawn upon.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved from time to time in litigation, claims, and proceedings. The outcomes of the Company’s legal proceedings are\ninherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainty.\nThe Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If it is\ndetermined that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the reasonably possible loss is disclosed. The\nCompany evaluates developments in legal matters that\n13\nTable of contents\ncould affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and makes adjustments\nas appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine the likelihood of matters and the estimated amount of a loss related to such\nmatters. To date, losses in connection with legal proceedings have not been material.\nThe Company expenses legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nIndemnifications\nThe Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including\ncertain customers, business partners, investors, contractors and the Company’s officers, directors and certain employees. It is not possible to\ndetermine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the Company’s limited history of prior indemnification claims\nand the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded in the Company’s condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisions have not been material. As of September 30, 2024, the\nCompany did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.\nNon-income Taxes\nThe Company may be subject to audit by various tax authorities with regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-\nincome tax audits primarily arises from different interpretations on tax treatment and tax rates applied. The Company accrues liabilities for non-\nincome taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and\nreasonably estimable. If a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company discloses the reasonably\npossible loss.\n5.

In\nMay and August 2023, the Company's Board authorized increases to the repurchase program of $296.0 million and $447.6 million, respectively.\nIn February 2024, the Company's Board authorized an additional increase of $1.25 billion to the repurchase program.\nRepurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions, subject to\nmarket conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance\nwith the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). The Company may also, from\ntime to time, enter into Rule 10b-5 trading plans, to facilitate repurchases of shares. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to\nacquire any particular amount of Class A common stock, has no expiration date and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time at\nthe Company's discretion.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 16,081,408 and\n46,665,285 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate amount, including commissions and fees, of $981.3 million and $1,153.6 million,\nrespectively.

As the liquidation and\n15\nTable of contents\ndividend rights are identical for Class A and Class B common stock, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportional basis and the\nresulting net income per share attributable to common stockholders will, therefore, be the same for both Class A and Class B common stock on\nan individual or combined basis.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders (in\nthousands, except share and per share data):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic EPS\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 434,420 $ 108,639 $ 980,572 $ 184,478\nLess:\nIncome attributable to options exercised by promissory notes (110) (442) (1,169) (720)\nIncome attributable to common stock subject to share repurchase\nagreements — (360) (1,001) (228)\nIncome attributable to unvested early exercised options — (2) (2) (15)\nNet income attributable to common stockholders—Basic $ 434,310 $ 107,835 $ 978,400 $ 183,515\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares used in computing net income per share—\nBasic 336,931,269 341,435,759 336,167,052 357,009,609\nNet income per share attributable to common stockholders—Basic: $ 1.29 $ 0.32 $ 2.91 $ 0.51\nDiluted EPS\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 434,420 $ 108,639 $ 980,572 $ 184,478\nLess:\nIncome attributable to options exercised by promissory notes (106) (423) (1,129) (698)\nIncome attributable to common stock subject to share repurchase\nagreements — (345) (967) (220)\nIncome attributable to unvested early exercised options — (2) (2) (15)\nNet income attributable to common stockholders—Diluted $ 434,314 $ 107,869 $ 978,475 $ 183,545\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares used in computing net income per share—\nBasic 336,931,269 341,435,759 336,167,052 357,009,609\nWeighted-average dilutive stock awards 11,294,194 15,470,463 12,105,565 11,249,904\nWeighted-average shares used in computing net income per share—\nDiluted 348,225,463 356,906,222 348,272,617 368,259,513\nNet income per share attributable to common stockholders—Diluted: $ 1.25 $ 0.30 $ 2.81 $ 0.50\nThe following table presents the forms of antidilutive potential common shares:\nAs of September 30,\n2024 2023\nStock options exercised for promissory notes 85,000 1,399,999\nEarly exercised stock options — 5,736\nStock options — 613,968\nUnvested RSUs — 4,747,127\nESPP 32,784 —\nTotal antidilutive potential common shares 117,784 6,766,830\n9. Income Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. The Company bases the interim tax accruals on an\nestimated annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income and records the discrete tax items in the period to which they relate. In each\nquarter, the Company updates the estimated annual effective tax rate and makes a year-to-date adjustment to the tax provision as necessary.\nThe Company’s calendar\n16\nTable of contents\nyear 2024 annual effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to jurisdictional mix of earnings, stock-based compensation\nexpense, research and development credits, foreign tax credits, foreign derived intangible income deduction, and global intangible low-taxed\nincome.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the Company's unrecognized tax benefits, and the\nCompany does not expect material changes in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.\n10. Segments\nThe Company determines its operating segments based on how its chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), the Chief Executive Officer,\nmanages the business, allocates resources, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance. The Company's two operating\nand reportable segments are as follows:\n• Software Platform: Software Platform generates revenue primarily from fees paid by advertisers for the placement of ads on\nmobile applications owned by Publishers.\n• Apps: Apps generates revenue when a user of one of the Apps makes an in-app purchase and when an advertiser purchases\nthe digital advertising inventory of the Company's portfolio of Apps.\nThe CODM evaluates the performance of each operating segment using revenue and segment adjusted EBITDA. The Company defines\nsegment adjusted EBITDA as revenue less expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and certain items that the Company does not\nbelieve are reflective of the operating segments’ core operations. Expenses include indirect costs that are allocated to operating segments\nbased on a reasonable allocation methodology, which are generally related to sales and marketing activities and general and administrative\noverhead. Revenue and expenses exclude transactions between the Company's operating segments. The CODM does not evaluate operating\nsegments using asset information, and, accordingly, the Company does not report asset information by segment.\nThe following table provides information about the Company's reportable segments and a reconciliation of the total segment adjusted\nEBITDA to income before income taxes (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue:\nSoftware Platform $ 835,186 $ 504,452 $ 2,224,571 $ 1,265,273\nApps 363,049 359,804 1,111,898 1,064,553\nTotal Revenue $ 1,198,235 $ 864,256 $ 3,336,469 $ 2,329,826\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA:\nSoftware Platform $ 653,396 $ 364,117 $ 1,665,898 $ 855,697\nApps 68,220 55,174 205,683 170,806\nTotal Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 721,616 $ 419,291 $ 1,871,581 $ 1,026,503\nInterest expense $ (75,213) $ (78,583) $ (224,061) $ (204,081)\nOther income, net 4,500 771 17,138 26,359\nAmortization, depreciation and write-offs (99,635) (121,797) (320,843) (369,897)\nLoss on disposal of long-lived assets — — (1,646) —\nNon-operating foreign exchange gain 935 613 1,159 1,159\nStock-based compensation (81,557) (110,839) (275,534) (275,058)\nTransaction-related expense (26) (231) (880) (995)\nRestructuring costs (2,951) — (6,033) (2,316)\nIncome before income taxes $ 467,669 $ 109,225 $ 1,060,881 $ 201,674\n11. Credit Agreement\nThe Company is a party to a certain credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for a senior secured term loan maturing in\nOctober 2028 (“2028 Term Loan\"), a senior secured term loan maturing in August 2030 (“2030 Term Loan”), and a revolving credit facility.\nIn March 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 10 to the Credit Agreement which reduces the interest rate margin from 3.1%\nto 2.5% with respect to SOFR loans (or from 2.0% to 1.5% with respect to base rate\n17\nTable of contents\nloans). In connection with the amendment, the Company increased the aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Term Loan to $2.09 billion and\nreduced the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Term Loan to $1.46 billion. The other material terms of the Credit Agreement remain\nunchanged.\nThe transaction was assessed at the syndicated lender level and was accounted for primarily as a debt modification. The Company\nexpensed $6.2 million of third-party costs incurred with the amendment in other income, net in the Company’s condensed consolidated\nstatement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Fees paid to the lenders in connection with the amendment were\nrecorded as an additional debt discount and are amortized to interest expense over the remaining term, together with unamortized original debt\nissuance costs and discount, using the effective interest method.\nIn March 2024, the Company drew down an additional $418.7 million from the revolving credit facility to fund certain repurchases under\nthe Company's share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2024, the entire outstanding amount under the revolving credit facility of\n$603.7 million was repaid in full. KKR Corporate Lending (CA) LLC, an affiliate of KKR Denali Holdings L.P. (“KKR Denali”) which owns more\nthan 10% of the Company's voting interests, has provided revolving credit commitments in the amount of $15.0 million under the revolving credit\nfacility.\n12. Related Party Transactions\nOn February 29, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with KKR Denali, and BofA\nSecurities, Inc., acting for themselves and as representative of other underwriters (collectively, the “Underwriters”), in connection with a\nsecondary public offering (the “Offering”) of 19,866,397 shares of the Company's Class A common stock by KKR Denali. Pursuant to the\nUnderwriting Agreement, on March 6, 2024, the Company repurchased from the Underwriters 10,466,397 shares of Class A common stock sold\nto the Underwriters by KKR Denali in the Offering at a price per share of $54.46, the same per share price paid by the Underwriters to KKR\nDenali in the Offering. In connection with the Offering, KKR Denali converted 16,000,000 shares of Class B common stock to Class A common\nstock. See Note 6 – Equity for additional information on the share repurchase program.\nOn February 14, 2024, the Company entered into certain investment and arm's length commercial agreements with Humans, Inc. See\nNote 3 - Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements for additional information. Eduardo Vivas, a member the Company's board of\ndirectors, serves as the Chief Operating Officer of Humans, Inc., and a member of its board of directors.\nOn March 8, 2019, the Company entered into a promissory note with Rafael Vivas, the brother of Eduardo Vivas, a member of the\nCompany's board of directors, for the purpose of advancing him funds to allow him to early exercise his stock options (“Vivas Note”). The Vivas\nNote was issued in the amount of $2.3 million at an interest rate of 2.59%, and later amended on August 7, 2020 to lower the interest rate on the\noutstanding balance of such note to the then applicable IRS annual mid-term rate of 0.41%. On March 8, 2024, the principal amount due under\nthe Vivas Note plus accrued interest, or $2.3 million, was repaid in full to the Company and the Vivas Note was extinguished.\nThe Company had no other material related party transactions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n13. Subsequent Events\nIn October 2024, the Company's Board approved an increase to the repurchase program of $2.0 billion such that up to $2.3 billion of Class\nA common stock may be repurchased.\n18\nTable of contents\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to\nsuch differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and other parts of this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nOverview\nOur mission is to create meaningful connections between companies and their ideal customers. We provide end-to-end software and AI-\npowered solutions for businesses to reach, monetize and grow their global audience. We also operate a portfolio of owned mobile apps and\naccelerated our market penetration through an active acquisition and partnership strategy. Our scaled business model sits at the nexus of the\nadvertising ecosystem, which creates a durable competitive advantage that has fueled our clients’ success and our strong growth.\nSince our founding in 2011, we have been focused on building a software-based platform for advertisers to improve the marketing and\nmonetization of their content. Our founders, who are mobile app developers themselves, quickly realized the real impediment to success and\ngrowth in the advertising ecosystem was a discovery and monetization problem—breaking through the congested app stores to efficiently find\nusers and successfully grow their business. Their first-hand experience with these challenges led to the development of our infrastructure and\nSoftware Platform. We capitalized on our success and understanding of the mobile app ecosystem by entering into the mobile game apps\nindustry in 2018. Our global diversified portfolio of apps now consists of over 200 free-to-play mobile games across five genres, run by ten\nstudios.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue increased 39% year-over-year to $1.20 billion, from $864.3 million in the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. We generated net income of $434.4 million and $108.6 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We generated Adjusted EBITDA of $721.6 million and $419.3 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, our net cash provided by operating activities was $1.40 billion and $717.5 million in the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We generated Free Cash Flow of $1.38 billion and $697.3 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Given our strong financial position, we have been able to reinvest in our expansion\nand growth, and repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. See the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for definitions of\nour non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to\nthese measures.\nOur Business Model\nWe collect revenue from our Software Platform and our Apps. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Software Platform\nRevenue represented 70% of total revenue and Apps Revenue represented 30% of total revenue.\nWe report our operating results through two reportable segments: Software Platform and Apps.\nOur CODM, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates performance of each segment based on several factors, of which the financial\nmeasures are segment revenue and segment adjusted EBITDA, as defined in Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe Software Platform and Apps segments provide a view into the organization of our business and generate revenue as follows:\nSoftware Platform Revenue\nWe primarily generate Software Platform Revenue from fees paid by advertisers who use our Software Platform to grow and monetize\ntheir content. We are able to grow our Software Platform Revenue by improving our various software technologies.\nSoftware Platform clients include a wide variety of advertisers, from indie developer studios to some of the largest global internet\nplatforms, such as Facebook and Google. Our Software Platform provides advertisers with\n19\nTable of contents\naccess to over 1.4 billion daily active users1. As such, we see multiple opportunities to gain new Software Platform clients, and to increase spend\nfrom existing clients, as we help them grow their businesses and make them more successful.\nOur Software Platform includes AppDiscovery, MAX, Adjust, and Wurl. Clients use AppDiscovery to automate, optimize, and manage their\nuser acquisition investments. They set marketing and user growth goals, and AppDiscovery optimizes their ad spend in an effort to achieve their\nreturn on advertising spend targets and other marketing objectives. AppDiscovery comprises the vast majority of revenue from our Software\nPlatform. Revenue is generated from our advertisers, typically on a performance basis, and shared with our advertising publishers, typically on a\ncost per impression model.\nSoftware Platform clients use MAX to optimize purchases of app advertising inventory. The MAX tool provides insights to manage against\nkey performance indicators, understand the long-term value of users, and help manage profitability. Revenue from MAX is generated based on a\npercentage of client spend. As more advertising networks move to in-app real-time bidding, we expect growth in the adoption of, and revenue\nfrom, MAX.\nSoftware Platform clients use Adjust's measurement and analytics marketing platform to better understand their users' journey while\nallowing marketers to make smarter decisions through measurement, attribution and fraud prevention. Revenue from Adjust is primarily\ngenerated from an annual software subscription fee.\nSoftware Platform clients use Wurl's connected TV (\"CTV\") platform to distribute streaming video, maximize advertising revenue, and\nacquire and retain viewers or subscribers. Revenue from Wurl is primarily generated from content companies, typically on a usage-based model.\nApps Revenue\nApps Revenue is generated when a user of one of our Apps makes an in-app purchase (\"IAP\") and when clients purchase the digital\nadvertising inventory of our portfolio of Apps (\"IAA\"). We are able to grow our Apps Revenue by adding more apps to our Apps portfolio and\nincreasing engagement on our existing Apps.\nOur Apps are generally free-to-play mobile games and generate IAP Revenue through IAPs. IAPs consist of virtual goods used to enhance\ngameplay, accelerate access to certain features or levels, and augment other mobile game progression opportunities for the user. IAPs drive\nmore engagement and better economics from our Apps. The vast majority of our IAP revenue flows through two app stores, Apple App Store and\nGoogle Play, which charge us a standard commission on IAPs. IAP Revenue represented 68% of total Apps Revenue for the three months\nended September 30, 2024.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had an average of 1.6 million Monthly Active Payers (\"MAPs\") across our\nportfolio of Apps. Over that period, we had an Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (\"ARPMAP\") of $52. See “Key Metrics” below for\nadditional information on how we calculate MAPs and ARPMAP.\nIAA clients that purchase advertising inventory from our Apps are able to target highly relevant users from our diverse and global portfolio\nof over 200 mobile games. Our clients leverage a broad set of high-performing mobile ad formats, including playable and rewarded video, and\nare able to match these ads with relevant users resulting in a better return on their advertising spend. By increasing the number of users and\ntheir engagement, as well as better matching ads with the appropriate target audience, we are able to increase our revenue from IAA clients that\npurchase advertising inventory from our Apps. IAA Revenue represented 32% of total Apps Revenue for the three months ended September 30,\n2024.\nKey Metrics\nWe review the following key metrics on a regular basis in order to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our\nperformance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions.\nMonthly Active Payers (\"MAPs\"). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device active on one of our Apps in a month that completed at\nleast one IAP during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate Apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period will\nbe counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during that period. We\nestimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain data from third-party attribution partners. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated\nsubstantially all of our IAP Revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and as such,\n1 We calculate daily active users as the average number of unique device identities that open a mobile app (whether that mobile app our own or a third party’s) which has our software development kit (SDK)\non each day in a period. We measure this figure through our SDK. An individual who uses an app in more than one country on a particular day will be counted as more than one unique device identity;\nhowever, if an individual uses more than one app in the same day, such individual is only counted once. This figure does not include any users who have opted out of allowing apps to track on their mobile\nphone.\n20\nTable of contents\nmanagement believes that MAPs is a useful metric to measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games.\nAverage Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (\"ARPMAP\"). We define ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a\nmonthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP\nfor each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP.\nThe following table shows our Monthly Active Payers and Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nMonthly Active Payers (millions) 1.6 1.8\nAverage Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer $ 52 $ 46\nOur key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or\ncomparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third\nparties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we use to calculate MAPs and\nARPMAP are based on internal data. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments and estimates for the\napplicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may adjust our\nprocesses for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income before interest expense, other income, net (excluding certain recurring\nitems), provision for income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted for stock-based compensation expense,\ntransaction-related expense and transaction bonus, publisher bonuses, restructuring costs, impairment and (gain) loss in connection with the\ndisposal of long-lived assets, non-operating foreign exchange (gain) losses, and change in the fair value of contingent consideration. We define\nAdjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for\ninternal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and\nother interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical\nfinancial periods. In addition, these measures are frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate and assess\nperformance. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of\nour performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business\nstrategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures and are presented for supplemental informational\npurposes only and should not be considered as alternatives or substitutes to financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. These\nmeasures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of\noperations that are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore\ncomparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted\nEBITDA margin should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n21\nTable of contents\nThe following table provides our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, and a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands. except percentages)\nRevenue $ 1,198,235 $ 864,256 $ 3,336,469 $ 2,329,826\nNet income $ 434,420 $ 108,639 $ 980,572 $ 184,478\nNet margin 36.3% 12.6% 29.4% 7.9%\nAdjusted as follows:\nInterest expense 75,213 78,583 224,061 204,081\nOther income, net (4,500) (771) (17,138) (26,359)\nProvision for income taxes 33,249 586 80,309 17,196\nAmortization, depreciation and write-offs 99,635 121,797 320,843 369,897\nLoss on disposal of long lived assets — — 1,646 —\nNon-operating foreign exchange gain (935) (613) (1,159) (1,159)\nStock-based compensation 81,557 110,839 275,534 275,058\nTransaction-related expense 26 231 880 995\nRestructuring costs 2,951 — 6,033 2,316\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 721,616 $ 419,291 $ 1,871,581 $ 1,026,503\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 60.2 % 48.5 % 56.1 % 44.1 %\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal payments\nof finance leases. We use Free Cash Flow to help manage the health of our business, prepare budgets and for capital allocation purposes. We\nbelieve Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental information to help investors understand underlying trends in our business and our\nliquidity. Free cash flow has certain limitations, including that it does not reflect our future contractual commitments. Our definition may differ from\nthe definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish Free Cash\nFlow or similar metrics. Thus, our Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures\nprepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table provides our Free Cash Flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and a reconciliation of net\ncash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 1,398,008 $ 717,522\nLess:\nPurchase of property and equipment (4,286) (4,002)\nPrincipal payments of finance leases (15,524) (16,191)\nFree Cash Flow $ 1,378,198 $ 697,329\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (106,387) $ (71,025)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (1,226,687) $ (1,392,267)\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe that the future success of our business depends on many factors, including the factors described below. While each of these\nfactors presents significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address in order to\ncontinue to grow profitably while maintaining strong cash flow.\nContinue to invest in innovation\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, significant investments in our Software Platform to enhance its effectiveness and value\nproposition for our clients. We expect that these investments will require spending on research and development, and acquisitions and\npartnerships related to technology components and products. We believe investments in our software, including our AI-powered advertising\nengine AXON, AppDiscovery, Adjust, and\n22\nTable of contents\nMAX, will further improve effectiveness for advertisers. In addition, we plan to continue to invest in the AI-based, self-learning capabilities of our\nadvertising recommendation engine, AXON. Our investments will also allow us to enter into and expand into new verticals outside of gaming,\nsuch as e-commerce, CTV, original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\"), and carrier-related markets. While our investments in research and\ndevelopment and acquisitions and partnerships may not result in revenue in the near term, we believe these investments position us to increase\nour revenue over time.\nRetain and grow existing clients\nWe rely on existing clients for a significant portion of our revenue. As we improve our Software Platform and Apps, we can attract\nadditional spend from these clients. Our clients include indie studio developers and some of the largest advertising platforms in the world. Our\nSoftware Platform provides advertisers with access to over 1.4 billion daily active users. As such, we believe there is significant room for us to\nfurther expand our relationships with these clients and increase their usage of our Software Platform. We have invested in targeted sales and\naccount-based marketing efforts to identify and showcase opportunities to clients and plan to continue to do so in the future.\nIn the past, our clients have generally increased their usage of our Software Platform, and as a result, growth from existing clients has\nbeen a primary driver of our revenue growth. We must continue to retain our existing clients and expand their spend with us over time to\ncontinue to grow our revenue, increase profitability and drive greater cash flow.\nAdd new clients globally\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to acquire new clients. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, 47% of our\nrevenue from Software Platform and IAA Revenue clients was generated from outside of the United States. We believe that the global\nopportunity is significant and will continue to expand as developers and advertisers outside the United States adopt our Software Platform and\nadvertise on our Apps. We also see opportunities to acquire new clients outside of mobile gaming, as the capabilities of our Software Platform\nare relevant to the broader advertising ecosystem. We are investing in direct sales, product development, education, and other capabilities to\ndrive increased awareness and adoption of our Software Platform and Apps, which investments may impact our profitability in the near term as\nwe seek further scale.\nContinued execution of strategic partnerships\nWe continue to explore strategic partnership opportunities related to our Software Platform, and the expansion of the markets it serves and\nwe may from time to time evaluate strategic acquisitions and partnerships opportunistically. From the beginning of 2018 through September 30,\n2024, we have invested approximately $4.1 billion in 33 strategic acquisitions and partnerships with mobile app developers and for technologies\nor relationships to enhance our Software Platform including the acquisition of MAX in 2018, Adjust in April 2021, MoPub in January 2022, and\nWurl in April 2022. We believe our future results of operations will be affected by our ability to continue to identify and execute such transactions\nthat are accretive to our growth and profitability.\nGrowth and structure of the mobile app and advertising ecosystems\nOur business and results of operations will be impacted by industry factors that drive the overall performance of the mobile app and\nadvertising ecosystems. Mobile app developers, including AppLovin, rely on third-party platforms, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play\nStore, among others, to distribute games, collect payments made for IAPs, and target users with relevant advertising. We expect this to continue\nfor the foreseeable future. These third-party platforms have significant market power and discretion to set platform fees, select which apps to\npromote, and decide how much consumer information to provide to advertising networks that enable our Software Platform to target users with\npersonalized and relevant advertising and allocate marketing campaigns in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Any changes made in the\npolicies of third-party platforms could drive rapid change across the mobile app and advertising ecosystems. For example, in April 2021, Apple\nstarted implementing its application tracking transparency framework that, among other things, requires users' opt-in consent for certain types of\ntracking. While this transparency framework has not had a significant impact on our overall business, it may do so in the future, including with\nrespect to the effectiveness of our advertising practices and/or our ability to efficiently generate revenue for our Apps. We rely in part on Identifier\nfor Advertisers (\"IDFA\") to provide us with data that helps our Software Platform better market and monetize Apps. In light of the IDFA and\ntransparency changes, we made changes to our data collection practices. To the extent we are unable to utilize IDFA or a similar offering, or if\nthe transparency changes and any related opt-in or other requirements result in decreases in the availability or utility of data relating to Apps, our\nSoftware Platform may not be as effective, we may not be able to continue to efficiently generate revenue for our Apps, and our revenue and\nresults of operations may be harmed. Additionally, Apple implemented new requirements for consumer disclosures regarding privacy and data\nprocessing practices in\n23\nTable of contents\nDecember 2020, which has resulted in increased compliance requirements and could result in decreased usage of our Apps. Apple incorporated\nnew SDK privacy controls into iOS 17, which was released in September 2023, including privacy manifests and signatures designed to allow app\ndevelopers to outline the data practices for SDKs embedded in their apps, manage tracking domains within SDKs, and curb device fingerprinting\nby requiring app developers to select allowed reasons for using data received through certain APIs. In February 2022, Google announced its\nPrivacy Sandbox initiative for Android, a multi-year effort expected to restrict tracking activity and limit advertisers' ability to collect app and user\ndata across Android devices. In January 2024, Google commenced rolling out a Chrome feature, called Tracking Protection, which limits cross-\nsite tracking. In May 2023, Google announced new consent management platform (\"CMP\") requirements for ads served in the European\nEconomic Area (\"EEA\") and UK, which requires, as of January 2024, publishers using Google AdSense, Ad Manager, or AdMob to use a CMP\nthat has been certified by Google and has integrated with the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s (“IAB”) Transparency and Consent Framework\nwhen serving ads to users in the EEA or the UK. While to date these third-party platform privacy changes have had some impact on the\ndiscoverability of apps across these platforms and have had a relatively muted aggregate impact on our results of operations, the ultimate impact\nof these or any similar or future changes to the policies of Apple or Google could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nNew tools for developers, industry standards, and platforms may emerge in the future. We believe our focus on the advertising ecosystem\nhas allowed us to understand the needs of our clients and our relentless innovation has enabled us to quickly adapt to changes in the industry\nand pioneer new solutions. We must continue to innovate and stay ahead of developments in the advertising and mobile app ecosystems in\norder for our business to succeed and our results of operations to continue to improve.\nCurrent Economic Conditions\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties caused by global economic conditions and events with significant macroeconomic impacts,\nincluding, but not limited to, international conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and actions taken to counter inflation. Inflation, rising interest\nrates and reduced consumer confidence have caused and may continue to cause our clients to be cautious in their spending. The full impact of\nthese macroeconomic events and the extent to which these macro factors may impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations\nin the future remains uncertain. The risks related to our business are further described in the section titled “Risk Factors\" in Part II, Item 1A of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate Software Platform Revenue primarily from fees collected from advertisers spending on AppDiscovery, typically on a\nperformance basis, then shared with our advertising publishers, typically on a cost per impression basis. Software Platform Revenue also\nincludes fees generated based on a percentage of client spend through MAX and subscription fees for Adjust's measurement and analytics\nmarketing platform. Revenue from other services within the Software Platform was not material.\nWe generate Apps Revenue from IAPs made by the users within our Apps and from IAA generated from advertisers that purchase\nadvertising inventory from our diverse portfolio of Apps.\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of third-party payment processing fees for distribution partners, amortization of\nacquired technology-related intangible assets, amortization of finance lease right-of-use assets related to certain servers and networking\nequipment and costs for third-party cloud service providers. Third-party payment processing fees relate to IAP Revenue. The fees for IAPs are\nprocessed and collected by third-party distribution partners. We expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars over the long term as\nour business and revenue continue to grow. We also expect our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-period.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of user acquisition costs, marketing programs and other advertising\nexpenses, professional services costs related to the marketing of apps by third parties, personnel-related expenses including salaries, employee\nbenefits, and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in sales and marketing activities, amortization of acquired user-related\nintangible assets, travel and allocated facilities and information technology costs.\nWe plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our Software Platform customer base and increase brand awareness. We\nalso plan to continue to invest in new App launches to the extent we see\n24\nTable of contents\nopportunities for cost-effective growth. We expect sales and marketing expenses to fluctuate period-over-period as we launch new games. We\nalso expect our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-period in the near term as we invest to grow\nour customer base and increase brand awareness, and to decrease over the long term as we benefit from greater scale.\nResearch and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of product development costs, including personnel-\nrelated expenses such as salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in research and development\nactivities, professional services costs related to development of new apps by third parties, consulting costs, regulatory compliance costs, and\nallocated facilities and information technology costs.\nWe plan to continue to invest in research and development to continue to enhance our Software Platform and to improve existing games\nand develop new games. We expect our research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-period in the\nnear term as we invest to enhance our Software Platform and improve our existing Apps and develop new Apps, and to decrease over the long\nterm as we benefit from greater scale.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to support our business, including\npersonnel-related expenses such as salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in finance, accounting,\nlegal, human resources and administration, professional services fees for legal, accounting, recruiting, and administrative services (including\ntransaction-related expenses), insurance, travel, and allocated facilities and information technology costs.\nWe plan to continue to invest in our general and administrative function to support the growth of our business. We expect our general and\nadministrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-period in the near term as we invest to support the growth of our\nbusiness, and to decrease over the long term as we benefit from greater scale.\nOther Income and Expenses\nInterest expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt\ndiscount, and gains and losses of interest rate swap related to the variable interest payments associated with our outstanding debt.\nOther income, net. Other income, net, primarily includes interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, fair value adjustments relating\nto our non-marketable equity securities, and foreign currency gains and losses.\nProvision for income taxes. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These\nforeign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be\ntaxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income,\nimpacts from acquisition restructuring, deduction benefits related to foreign-derived intangible income, future changes in the valuation of our\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws. Additionally, our effective tax rate can vary based on the amount of pre-tax income or\nloss.\n25\nTable of contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our historical condensed consolidated statements of operations data:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nRevenue $ 1,198,235 $ 864,256 $ 3,336,469 $ 2,329,826\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue(1)(2) 269,659 265,049 846,354 785,584\nSales and marketing(1)(2) 205,753 212,352 634,547 607,755\nResearch and development(1) 149,990 159,288 469,209 441,563\nGeneral and administrative(1) 37,899 41,249 120,880 116,231\nTotal costs and expenses 663,301 677,938 2,070,990 1,951,133\nIncome from operations 534,934 186,318 1,265,479 378,693\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense (75,213) (78,583) (224,061) (204,081)\nOther income, net 7,948 1,490 19,463 27,062\nTotal other expense, net (67,265) (77,093) (204,598) (177,019)\nIncome before income taxes 467,669 109,225 1,060,881 201,674\nProvision for income taxes 33,249 586 80,309 17,196\nNet income $ 434,420 $ 108,639 $ 980,572 $ 184,478\n__________________\n(1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue $ 1,314 $ 1,309 $ 4,104 $ 3,942\nSales and marketing 22,203 26,025 67,651 62,121\nResearch and development 47,940 70,462 169,205 176,337\nGeneral and administrative 10,100 13,043 34,574 32,658\nTotal stock-based compensation $ 81,557 $ 110,839 $ 275,534 $ 275,058\n(2) Includes amortization expense related to acquired intangibles as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue $ 73,679 $ 93,398 $ 245,493 $ 288,180\nSales and marketing 16,851 16,829 50,472 50,397\nTotal amortization expense related to acquired intangibles $ 90,530 $ 110,227 $ 295,965 $ 338,577\n26\nTable of contents\nThe following table sets forth the components of our condensed consolidated statements of operations for each of the periods presented\nas a percentage of revenue(1):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 %\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue 23 % 31 % 25 % 34 %\nSales and marketing 17 % 25 % 19 % 26 %\nResearch and development 13 % 18 % 14 % 19 %\nGeneral and administrative 3 % 5 % 4 % 5 %\nTotal costs and expenses 55 % 78 % 62 % 84 %\nIncome from operations 45 % 22 % 38 % 16 %\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense (6)% (9)% (7)% (9)%\nOther income, net 1 % — % 1 % 1 %\nTotal other expense, net (6)% (9)% (6)% (8)%\nIncome before income taxes 39 % 13 % 32 % 9 %\nProvision for income taxes 3 % 0 % 2 % 1 %\nNet income 36 % 13 % 29 % 8 %\n_________________\n(1) Totals of percentages of revenue may not foot due to rounding.\nComparison of Our Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nRevenue\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2023 to 2024 2023 to 2024\n2024 2023 % change 2024 2023 % change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nSoftware Platform Revenue $ 835,186 $ 504,452 66 % $ 2,224,571 $ 1,265,273 76 %\nIn-App Purchases Revenue 246,344 247,309 — % 756,110 732,262 3 %\nIn-App Advertising Revenue 116,705 112,495 4 % 355,788 332,291 7 %\nTotal Apps Revenue 363,049 359,804 1 % 1,111,898 1,064,553 4 %\nTotal Revenue $ 1,198,235 $ 864,256 39 % $ 3,336,469 $ 2,329,826 43 %\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Software Platform Revenue increased by $330.7 million, or 66%, compared to the\nsame period in the prior year primarily due to improved AppDiscovery performance, where net revenue per installation increased 22% and the\nvolume of installations increased 39%.

As of September 30,\n2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $567.6 million.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents would be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures needs\nfor at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including our growth rate; sales and\nmarketing activities; timing and extent of spending to support our research and development efforts; and our continued need to invest in our IT\ninfrastructure to support our growth. In addition, we may enter into additional strategic partnerships as well as agreements to acquire or\n30\nTable of contents\ninvest in teams and technologies, including intellectual property rights, which could increase our cash requirements. As a result of these and\nother factors, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing sooner than we currently anticipate. If additional financing from\noutside sources is required, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when\nrequired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 1,398,008 $ 717,522\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (106,387) $ (71,025)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (1,226,687) $ (1,392,267)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,398.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisting of\n$980.6 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which included $320.8 million of amortization, depreciation, and write-offs and\n$275.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, $9.4 million of change in operating right of use assets, partially offset by a net decrease in\noperating assets and liabilities of $196.2 million. The net decrease in the operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in\naccounts receivable and a decrease in accrued liabilities, partially offset by higher accounts payable and lower prepaid expenses and other\nassets.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $717.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily consisting of $184.5\nmillion of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which included $369.9 million of amortization, depreciation, and write-offs, $275.1\nmillion of stock-based compensation expense, $11.7 million of change in operating right of use assets, and $9.7 million of amortization of debt\nissuance costs and discount, partially offset by a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $133.7 million. The net increase in the\noperating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable, other assets, and accrued liabilities and a decrease in\nprepaid expenses.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $106.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisting of\n$77.0 million in purchases of non-marketable equity securities and $18.3 million related to earn-out payments for acquisitions of intangible\nassets.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $71.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily consisting of $51.8 million\nrelated to earn-out payments associated with asset acquisitions and $16.9 million in purchases of non-marketable equity securities, partially\noffset by $8.3 million in proceeds from the sale of assets.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1,226.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisting of\nrepurchases of stock under our share repurchase program of $980.7 million, principal repayments of debt of $686.8 million, and payments for\nwithholding taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards of $644.4 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of debt of\n$1,072.3 million and $28.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchase of ESPP shares.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1,392.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily consisting of\nrepurchases of stock under the repurchase program of $1,153.6 million, repayments of debt principal of $490.5 million net of $210.3 million\nproceeds from issuance of debt, payments for withholding taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards of $115.8 million, payments\nfor license asset obligations of $15.3 million, and principal payments on finance leases of $16.2 million, partially offset by $185.0 million in\nproceeds from drawing down the revolving credit facility and $19.9 million in proceeds from exercise of stock options and purchase of ESPP\nshares.\n31\nTable of contents\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 16,081,408 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate\namount, including commissions and fees, of $981.3 million. In October 2024, our board of directors authorized an increase to our share\nrepurchase program of up to $2.0 billion, which additional amount may be repurchased from time to time subject to a limitation in any fiscal\nquarter of the amount of our Free Cash Flow in the preceding fiscal quarter and compliance with applicable law and any contractual restrictions\nunder our Credit Agreement (as defined below) or future agreements. For additional information, see Note 6 – Equity and Note 12 – Related\nParty Transactions of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nCredit Agreement\nWe are party to a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for senior secured term loans and a revolving credit facility.\nIn March 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 10 to the Credit Agreement which reduces the interest rate margin from 3.1% to 2.5% with\nrespect to SOFR loans (or from 2.0% to 1.5% with respect to base rate loans). In connection with the amendment, we increased the aggregate\nprincipal amount of the 2030 Term Loan to $2.09 billion and reduced the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Term Loan to $1.46 billion. The\nother material terms of the Credit Agreement remain unchanged.\nIn March 2024, we drew down an additional $418.7 million from the revolving credit facility to fund certain repurchases under the\nCompany's share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2024, the entire outstanding amount under the revolving credit facility of $603.7 million\nwas repaid in full, and the full amount of the revolving credit facility was available to be borrowed.\nThere were no other material changes to our debt and the related Credit Agreement since December 31, 2023.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2024, our non-cancelable minimum purchase commitment was primarily related to a multi-year contractual\narrangement with a cloud services provider. In August 2024, we amended our agreement with the cloud services provider. Under the amended\nagreement, we committed to spend a minimum of $1.26 billion over a three-year period. As of September 30, 2024, no payment had been\ntowards this commitment.\nExcept for scheduled payments from the ongoing business, there were no other material changes to our commitments under contractual\nobligations since December 31, 2023.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure\nof contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred\nduring the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable\nunder the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the\namount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and\nassumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nas compared to those disclosed in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n32\nTable of contents\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThere have been no material changes in market risk from the information presented in Part II, Item 7A. \"Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of\nour disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered\nby this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded\nthat, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-\n15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of\nachieving their desired objectives. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control\nover financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon\ncertain assumptions, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls\ncan provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,\nwithin our company have been detected.\n33\nTable of contents\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, as well as\ngovernmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. In addition, third parties may from time to time assert claims against us in the\nform of letters and other communications. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would, in our\nopinion, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Future litigation may be\nnecessary to defend ourselves and our business partners and to determine the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party proprietary rights,\nor to establish our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other\nfactors.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A common stock.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that are not\npresently known to us or that we currently believe are not material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and prospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could\nlose all or part of your investment.\nRisk Factor Summary\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk because our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,\nas further described below.

otherwise;\n• provisions of Delaware law, the Voting Agreement, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and our amended and restated\nbylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult; and\n• exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur results of operations are likely to fluctuate from period-to-period, which could cause the market price of our Class A common\nstock to decline.\nOur results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year in the\nfuture for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict. As a result, you should not rely upon our historical\nresults of operations as indicators of future performance. Numerous factors can influence our results of operations, including:\n• our ability to maintain and grow our client and user bases;\n• changes to our Software Platform, Apps, or other offerings, the development and introduction of new software, entry into new\nmarkets, or the development of new mobile apps by our studios or our competitors;\n• changes to the policies or practices of companies or governmental agencies that determine access to third-party platforms, such as\nthe Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, or to our Software Platform, Apps, website, or the internet generally;\n• changes to the policies or practices of third-party platforms, such as the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, including with\nrespect to Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers (\"IDFA\"), which helps advertisers assess the effectiveness of their advertising efforts, and\nwith respect to transparency regarding data processing;\n• the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond our current Software Platform and Apps;\n• our ability to achieve the anticipated synergies from our strategic acquisitions and effectively integrate new assets and businesses\nacquired by us;\n• the success of our strategic review of our Apps portfolio;\n• the actions of our competitors, both with respect to their own offerings and, to the extent such competitors are also our clients, with\nrespect to their use of our Software Platform;\n• costs and expenses related to the strategic acquisitions and partnerships, including costs related to integrating mobile gaming\nstudios or other companies that we acquire, as well as costs and expenses related to the development of our Software Platform or\nApps;\n• our ability to achieve or maintain profitability;\n• increases in and timing of operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;\n• system failures or outages, or actual or perceived breaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with preventing,\nresponding to, or remediating any such outages or breaches;\n• changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy, data protection, or AI or actions by\ngovernments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;\n• charges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet or changes in our expected estimated useful life of property\nand equipment and intangible assets;\n• adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs and the fees associated with investigating and defending\nclaims;\n• the overall tax rate for our business, which may be affected by the mix of income we earn in the United\n36\nTable of contents\nStates and in jurisdictions with comparatively lower tax rates;\n• the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period such laws are\nenacted or interpretations are issued and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period;\n• the application of new or changing financial accounting standards or practices; and\n• changes in regional or global business or macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of uncertainty in the global banking and\nfinancial services markets, political uncertainty and international conflicts around the world, inflation, and high interest rates, which\nmay impact the other factors described above.\nIn particular, it is difficult to predict if, when, or how newly-launched software or products may begin to generate revenue or decline in\npopularity. Further, we cannot be certain if a new App or product will become popular amongst users and generate revenue. The success of our\nbusiness depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our Software Platform and consistently and timely launch new Apps and\nproducts. It is difficult for us to predict with certainty when we will expand our Software Platform suite, launch a new App or product, or enter a\nnew market as we may require longer development schedules or soft launch periods to meet our quality standards and expectations. If our\nclients do not adopt our new Software Platform offerings, or develop or further invest in their own competing alternatives, or if we are unable to\nsuccessfully launch or acquire new Apps or products or maintain or improve existing Apps or successfully enter a new market, our business and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected. Fluctuations in our results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial\nguidance or the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or\nother cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nThe advertising and mobile app ecosystems are prone to cyberattacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or the data\nof our clients or users or to disrupt our ability to provide service. Our Software Platform, Apps, and other offerings involve the collection, storage,\nprocessing, and transmission of a large amount of data, including personal information, and we and our third-party service providers otherwise\nstore and process information, including our confidential and proprietary business information, and personal information and other information\nrelating to our employees and clients or other third parties. We also store and implement measures designed to secure the source code for our\nSoftware Platform and Apps as they are created. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or incidents impacting our systems or other\nsystems used in our business, or improper access to or disclosure of our data, including source code, or user data, including personal\ninformation, content, or payment information from users, or information from clients or other third parties, that is stored or otherwise processed in\nour business could result in the unauthorized loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or other misuse of such data, or unavailability of data or\nof our Software Platform, Apps, or other offerings. Any such event, or the perception it has occurred, could adversely affect our business and\nreputation, damage our operations, result in claims, litigation, or regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, fines, penalties, or other\nliability or obligations, and diminish our competitive position. In particular, a breach or incident, whether physical, electronic, or otherwise,\nimpacting systems on which source code or other sensitive data are stored could lead to loss, disruption, unavailability, or piracy of, or damage\nto, our offerings, lost or reduced ability to protect our intellectual property, and diminished competitive position.\nComputer malware (including ransomware), viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks or smishing), and general\nhacking have become more prevalent in the advertising and mobile app ecosystems. Some of these have occurred on our systems and\notherwise in our business in the past, and we expect will continue to occur in the future. We regularly encounter attempts to create false or\nundesirable user accounts or take other actions for purposes such as spamming or other objectionable ends. Any actual or attempted breaches,\nincidents, or attacks may cause disruptions or interruptions to our Software Platform, Apps, or other offerings, degrade the user experience,\nimpair, disrupt, or interrupt our internal systems and other systems and networks used in our business, or adversely affect our reputation,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Our efforts to protect our data, user data, and information from clients, partners, and\nother third parties, and to disable or otherwise respond to undesirable activities on our Software Platform, Apps, or other offerings, may also be\nunsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical defects, errors, or malfunctions; employee, contractor, vendor, or partner error or\nmalfeasance, including defects or vulnerabilities in information technology systems or offerings; cyberattacks, attacks designed to disrupt\nsystems or facilities, or breaches of physical security of our facilities or\n37\nTable of contents\ntechnical infrastructure; or other threats that evolve. Additionally, any such breach, incident, attack, malfunction, defect, or vulnerability, or the\nperception that any of these has occurred, may cause clients or users to lose confidence and trust in our Software Platform, Apps, or other\nofferings and otherwise harm our reputation and market position.\nIn addition, some developers or other business partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of advertisements, may\nreceive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web apps or other means. These third parties may misappropriate\nour information and engage in unauthorized use of it. If these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or\nexperience a breach of, or other security incident impacting, their networks or systems, our data or our users’ data may be lost, destroyed, or\nimproperly accessed, modified, disclosed, or otherwise misused. In such an event, or if such an event is perceived to have occurred, we may\nsuffer damage to our reputation, may have increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures and\nother costs relating to the incident, and we may face claims, demands, investigations, and other proceedings by private parties or governmental\nactors, and fines, penalties, and other liability or obligations, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. Any theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an\nevent could also adversely affect our business, competitive position, and results of operations.\nCyberattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and may be inherently difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although\nwe have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data, user data, and information from our partners; to prevent data\nloss, disable undesirable accounts and activities on our Software Platform or Apps; and to prevent and detect security breaches; we cannot\nassure you that such measures will provide comprehensive security, that we have been or will be able to identify breaches or other incidents or\nto react to them in a timely manner or that our remediation efforts will be successful. We experience cyberattacks and other security incidents of\nvarying degrees from time to time, and we may incur significant costs in investigating, protecting against, litigating, or remediating such incidents.\nWe may face increased risks of cyberattacks and other security incidents as a result of more employees working remotely. Our use of third-party\nsystems designed to enable remote workforce operations introduces security risks and increased cyberattacks, such as phishing attacks by\nthreat actors as a method for targeting personnel. Further, in connection with international conflicts around the world, such as in Ukraine and the\nMiddle East, there may be a heightened risk of potential cyberattacks by state actors or others.\nAdditionally, our Software Platform and other offerings operate in conjunction with, and we are in some cases dependent upon, third-party\nproducts, services, and components. Our ability to monitor our third-party service providers’ data security is limited, and in any event, attackers\nmay be able to circumvent our third-party service providers’ data security measures. There have been and may continue to be significant attacks\non certain third-party providers, and we cannot guarantee that our or our third-party providers’ systems and networks have not been breached or\nthat they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and\nnetworks of third parties that support us and our platform and service. If there is a security vulnerability, error, or other bug in one of these third-\nparty products, services, and components and if there is a security exploit targeting them, we could face increased costs, claims, liability, and\nadditional or new obligations, reduced revenue, and harm to our reputation or competitive position. We and our service providers may be unable\nto anticipate these techniques, react, remediate or otherwise address any security vulnerability, breach or other security incident in a timely\nmanner, or implement adequate preventative measures.\nFurther, we utilize AI technologies in our Software Platform and Apps and may expand such use in the future. Our use of AI technologies,\nand the use of AI technologies in third-party products and services, may create additional cybersecurity risks or increase cybersecurity risks,\nincluding risks of security breaches and incidents, and related liability and harm to our reputation. Further, AI technologies may be used in\nconnection with certain cybersecurity attacks, resulting in heightened risks of security breaches and incidents.\nIn addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making significant investments in data protection to combat misuse of our\nservices and user data by third parties. As a result of these efforts, we anticipate that we will discover incidents of misuse of user data or other\nundesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all such incidents or activity, in connection with such efforts or otherwise, whether\nowing to our data limitations, the scale of activity on our Software Platform, challenges related to our personnel working remotely, the re-\nallocation of resources to other projects, or other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by users, the media, or other third\nparties. Such incidents and activities have in the past, and may in the future, include the use or other processing of user data or our systems in a\nmanner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, improper advertising practices,\nactivities\n38\nTable of contents\nthat threaten people’s safety on- or offline or instances of spamming, scraping, data harvesting, or unsecured datasets. We may also be\nunsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate or respond to any such incidents effectively or in a timely manner. Any\nof the foregoing developments, or any reports of them occurring or the perception that any of them has occurred, could adversely affect user\ntrust and engagement, harm our brand and reputation, require us to change our business practices, result in claims, demands, investigations,\nand other proceedings by private parties or governmental actors, and fines, penalties, and other liability or obligations, and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, a number\nof which provide a private right of action. Many jurisdictions have enacted breach notification obligations, and our agreements with certain\ncustomers or partners may require us to notify them or fulfill other obligations in the event of a security breach. Affected users or government\nauthorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to\nor disclosure of data, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability, distract management\nand technical personnel, and result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices and to pay fines or penalties. Such\nactual or perceived breaches or other incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or\nengagement levels. Any of these events could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage may not extend to all types of privacy and data security breaches or other incidents, and it may be insufficient to\ncover all costs and expenses associated with such incidents. Further, such insurance may not continue to be available to us in the future on\neconomically reasonable terms, or at all, and insurers may deny us coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more\nlarge claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium\nincreases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our\nreputation, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party platforms to distribute our Apps and collect revenue, and if our ability to do so is harmed, or such third-party\nplatforms change their policies in such a way that restricts our business, increases our expenses, or limits the information we derive\nfrom our Apps, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe mobile app ecosystem depends in part on a relatively small number of third-party distribution platforms, such as the Apple App Store,\nthe Google Play Store, and Facebook, some of which are direct competitors. We derive significant revenue from the distribution of our Apps\nthrough these third-party platforms and almost all of our IAPs are made through the payment processing systems of these third-party platforms.\nWe are subject to the standard policies and terms of service of such third-party platforms, which generally govern the promotion, distribution,\ncontent, and operation of applications on such platforms. Each platform provider has broad discretion to change and interpret its terms of service\nand other policies with respect to us and other mobile app companies, and those changes may be unfavorable to us. A platform provider may\nalso change its fee structure, add fees associated with access to and use of its platform, alter how mobile apps are labeled or are able to\nadvertise on its platform, change how the personal information of its users is made available to developers on its platform, limit the use of\npersonal information for advertising purposes, restrict how users can share information on its platform or across platforms, or significantly\nincrease the level of compliance or requirements necessary to use its platform.\nFor example, in April 2021, Apple started implementing its application tracking transparency framework that, among other things, requires\nusers' opt-in consent for certain types of tracking. While this transparency framework has not had a significant impact on our overall business, it\nmay in the future, including with respect to the effectiveness of our advertising practices and/or our ability to efficiently generate revenue for our\nApps. We rely in part on IDFA to provide us with data that helps our Software Platform better market and monetize Apps. In light of the IDFA and\ntransparency changes, we made changes to our data collection practices. To the extent we are unable to utilize IDFA or a similar offering, or if\nthe transparency changes and any related opt-in or other requirements result in decreases in the availability or utility of data relating to Apps, our\nSoftware Platform may not be as effective, we may not be able to continue to efficiently generate revenue for our Apps, and our revenue and\nresults of operations may be harmed. Additionally, Apple implemented new requirements for consumer disclosures regarding privacy and data\nprocessing practices in December 2020, which has resulted in increased compliance requirements and could result in decreased usage of our\nApps. Apple incorporated new SDK privacy controls into iOS 17, which was released in September 2023, including privacy manifests and\nsignatures designed to allow app developers to outline the data practices for SDKs embedded in their apps, manage tracking domains within\nSDKs, and curb device fingerprinting by requiring app developers to select allowed reasons for using data received through certain APIs. Apple\nmade privacy manifests and signatures part of the App Store review in spring 2024.\n39\nTable of contents\nSimilarly, in February 2022, Google announced its Privacy Sandbox initiative for Android, a multi-year effort expected to restrict tracking\nactivity and limit advertisers' ability to collect app and user data across Android devices. In January 2024, Google commenced rolling out a\nChrome feature called Tracking Protection, which limits cross-site tracking. Additionally, in January 2024, Google started to roll out new CMP\nrequirements for ads served in the EEA and UK, which require publishers using Google AdSense, Ad Manager, or AdMob to use CMPs certified\nby Google and integrated with the IAB's Transparency and Consent Framework when serving ads to users in the EEA or the UK. According to\nGoogle, if publishers do not adopt a Google-certified CMP, only limited ads will be eligible to serve in the EEA and UK. To adapt to these\nchanges, we released the MAX SDK version 12.0.0. to support integration with Google's CMP solution. While to date these third-party platform\nprivacy changes have had some impact on the discoverability of apps across these platforms, and have had a relatively muted aggregate impact\non our results of operations, the ultimate impact of these or any similar or future changes to the policies of Apple or Google may adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDistribution platform providers from time to time limit, suspend or discontinue access to their platforms in connection with violations, or\nperceived violations, of terms of service. In addition, any change or deterioration in our relationship with such distribution provider may impact\nour access to its platform. If one of our distribution platform partners were to limit or discontinue the distribution of our Apps on their platform,\ngenerally, or any of our more successful Apps individually, it may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also rely on the continued popularity, user adoption, and functionality of third-party platforms. In the past, some of these platform\nproviders have been unavailable for short periods of time or experienced issues with their in-app purchasing functionality. In addition, third-party\nplatforms also impose certain file size limitations, which may limit the ability of users to download some of our larger Apps in over-the-\nair updates. Aside from these over-the-air file size limitations, a larger game file size could cause users to delete our mobile games once the file\nsize grows beyond the capacity of their devices’ storage limitations or could reduce the number of downloads of these mobile games.\nIf issues arise with third-party platforms that impact the visibility or availability of our Apps, our users’ ability to access our Apps or our\nability to monetize our Apps, or otherwise impact the design or effectiveness of our Software Platform, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are highly dependent on our co-founder and chief executive officer, as well as our senior management team, and our business and\ngrowth may be adversely affected if we fail to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel.\nOur future success depends in significant part on the continued service of our key management and engineering personnel,\nincluding our co-founder, CEO, and Chairperson, Adam Foroughi. Our ability to compete and grow depends in part on the efforts and talents of\nthese employees and executives, who are important to our vision, strategic direction, culture, products, and technology. We do not have\nemployment agreements, other than offer letters, with Mr. Foroughi or other members of our senior management team, and we do\nnot maintain key-man insurance for members of our senior management team. The loss of Mr. Foroughi or any other member of our senior\nmanagement team could cause disruption and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn addition, our ability to execute our strategy depends in part on our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly\nskilled employees, particularly in the competitive fields of game development, product management, engineering, AI, machine learning, and data\nscience. We believe that our corporate culture has been an important factor in our ability to hire and retain key employees, and if we are unable\nto maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we may be unable to foster the innovation, creativity, and teamwork we believe we need to support\nour growth. While we believe we compete favorably, competition for highly skilled employees is intense, particularly in Silicon Valley, where our\nheadquarters is located. Interviewing, hiring, and integrating new employees has been and will continue to be challenging as we continue to\nnavigate the global remote working environment. With the general shift to remote work, we are able to tap into candidate pools previously\nunavailable to us, but candidates have also sought increased flexibility and may have more options available to them. We have and will continue\nto devote increased efforts to maintaining our collaborative culture, including through the use of videoconferencing and other online\ncommunication and sharing tools, and to monitoring the health, safety, morale, and productivity of our employees, including new employees, as\nwe evaluate the impacts of the global remote working environment on our business and employees. If we are unable to identify, hire, and retain\nhighly skilled employees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have historically hired a number of key personnel and additional team members working on our Software Platform and Apps through\nstrategic acquisitions and partnerships, and as competition within the advertising and\n40\nTable of contents\nmobile app ecosystems for attractive target companies with a skilled employee base persists and increases, we may incur significant expenses\nand difficulty in continuing this practice. The loss of talented employees with experience in the assets we acquire could result in significant\ndisruptions to our business and the integration of acquired assets and businesses. If we do not succeed in recruiting, retaining, and motivating\nthese key employees, we may not achieve the anticipated results of acquisitions.\nThe failure to attract new clients, the loss of clients, or a reduction in spending by these clients could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is Software Platform Revenue and In-App Advertising (\"IAA\") Revenue from our Apps. Software\nPlatform Revenue is mostly from AppDiscovery and is generated from our advertisers, typically on a performance-based, cost-per-\ninstall basis, then shared with our advertising publishers, typically on a cost per impression model. IAA Revenue generated from our Apps comes\nfrom advertisers that purchase ad inventory from our diverse portfolio of mobile games. As is common in the advertising ecosystem, our clients\ndo not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Our success depends in part on our ability to satisfy our advertising partners.\nRevenue could also be impacted by a number of other factors, including:\n• our ability to attract and retain clients;\n• our ability to improve the effectiveness and predictability of our advertising and maintain and improve our AI-powered advertising\nengine AXON;\n• our ability to maintain or increase advertiser demand and third-party publisher supply, the quantity or quality of advertisements\nshown to users, or our pricing of advertisements;\n• our ability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our Apps;\n• mobile app changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or relative\nprominence of advertisements displayed on our Apps;\n• our ability to recruit, train, and retain personnel to support continued growth of our Software Platform;\n• our ability to establish and maintain our brand and reputation;\n• loss of market share to our competitors, including if competitors offer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective\nproducts;\n• the development and success of technologies designed to block the display of advertisements or block our ad measurement tools,\nwhich have in the past impacted and may in the future impact our business, or technologies that make it easier for users to opt out of\nbehavioral targeting;\n• the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate\nthe value of our Software Platform to advertisers, developers and publishers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\n• government actions or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to AI or advertising, including developments that\nmay impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;\n• changes that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes to policies by mobile\noperating system and third-party platform providers, and the degree to which users opt in or opt out of certain types of ad targeting\nas a result of changes and controls implemented in connection with such policy changes and with the E.U. General Data Protection\nRegulation (the \"GDPR\"), ePrivacy Directive, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\") as amended by the California\nPrivacy Rights Act (the \"CPRA\") and similar U.S. privacy laws in other states, and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (the\n\"COPPA\");\n• decisions by clients to reduce their advertising due to concerns about legal liability or uncertainty regarding their own legal and\ncompliance obligations, or due to negative publicity, regardless of its accuracy, involving us, our user data practices, advertising\nmetrics or tools, our Software Platform or Apps, or other companies in our industry; and\n• the impact of macroeconomic conditions, inflation, high interest rates, uncertainty in the global banking and financial services\nmarkets, political uncertainty and international conflicts around the world, such as in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as, friction\nbetween the United States and China, and\n41\nTable of contents\nresponses thereto, and seasonality, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among specific types of advertisers or within\nparticular geographies.\nFrom time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our revenue to varying degrees. The occurrence of any of these or\nother factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our Software Platform and use of our Apps, which may reduce the prices we\nreceive for our advertisements or cause clients to stop advertising with us altogether, either of which would adversely affect our business and\nresults of operations. The failure to attract new clients, loss of clients, or reduction in spending by clients could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nThe advertising ecosystem and mobile gaming are intensely competitive. If clients or users prefer our competitors’ products or\nservices over our own, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face significant competition in the advertising ecosystem and in mobile gaming. We offer a suite of solutions for advertisers to get their\ncontent discovered and downloaded by the right users, optimize return on marketing spend, and maximize the monetization of their engagement.\nWe collect revenue from clients for fees paid by advertisers, including developers, that use our Software Platform and from the sale of\nadvertising inventory of our Apps. Advertisers often engage with several advertising platforms and networks to purchase advertisements and\ndevelopers often engage with multiple tools to market and monetize their apps. Accordingly, we face significant competition from traditional,\nonline, and mobile businesses that provide ad networks and platforms, mobile apps and games, media, and other services for advertisers to\nreach relevant audiences. We also face competition from providers of developer tools that enable developers to reach their audiences or\nmanage or optimize their advertising campaigns. These companies vary in size and include Facebook, Google, and Unity Software as well as\nvarious private companies. Several of these companies, including Facebook, Google, and Unity Software, are also our partners and\nclients. Additionally, our studios build many of our Apps using the development kits offered by Unity Software. Changes in pricing or the terms on\nwhich developers engage with companies in the mobile app ecosystem, such as the pricing changes announced by Unity Software in September\n2023, could negatively impact our studios and the mobile app ecosystem generally. Clients who are also competitors may decide to invest in\ntheir own offerings rather than continue to use our Software Platform or advertise on our Apps.\nAdditionally, we also compete with businesses that develop online and mobile games and other mobile apps, which vary in size and\ninclude companies such as Activision Blizzard (Microsoft), Tencent, and Zynga (Take-Two Interactive), as well as other public and private\ncompanies. Many of these companies are also our partners and clients. As we expand our global operations and mobile app offerings, we\nincreasingly face competition from high-profile companies with significant online presences that may introduce new or expanded offerings, such\nas Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Snap. In addition, other large companies that to date have not actively focused on mobile apps or\ngaming may decide to develop mobile apps or gaming offerings, such as Amazon’s games platform, or partner with other developers. Some of\nthese current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources that can be used to develop, acquire, or brand additional mobile\napps or gaming alternatives, and may have more diversified revenue sources than we do and therefore may be less severely affected by\nchanges in consumer preferences, regulations, or other developments that may impact our business or industry.\nFurther, as there are relatively low barriers to entry to develop and publish a mobile app, we expect new competitors to enter the market\nand existing competitors to allocate more resources towards developing and marketing competing games and apps. Because our mobile games\nare free-to-play, our Apps compete primarily on the basis of user experience rather than price. The proliferation of apps makes it difficult for us to\ndifferentiate ourselves from our competitors and compete for users and the success of our Apps will depend in part on our Software Platform\ncontinuing to provide effective marketing and monetization tools.\nWe also face competition for advertising spending and for the discretionary spending, leisure time, and attention of our users from game\nplatforms such as personal computer and console games, and other leisure time activities, such as television, movies, music, sports, and the\ninternet. During periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, levels of advertising and discretionary spending have historically decreased and are\nlikely to decrease and therefore this competition may intensify, which has at times harmed and may in the future harm our revenue.\nIn addition, non-game applications for mobile devices, such as social media and messaging, television, movies, music, dating, and sports, have\nbecome increasingly popular, making the overall mobile app ecosystem highly fragmented and making it more difficult for any mobile app to\ndifferentiate itself. To the extent we explore entering into new markets or new business opportunities in the mobile app ecosystem or otherwise,\nwe may also compete with established businesses with more experience in such areas. Our future growth depends in part on the overall health\nof the mobile app ecosystem and in particular, mobile gaming. Increasing competition could result in decreases in our App\n42\nTable of contents\nusers, increased user acquisition costs, lower engagement with our Apps, and loss of key personnel, all of which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nSome of our current and potential competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes\nthat enable them to compete more effectively than us, particularly outside of the United States. Some of our current and potential competitors\nmay have greater resources, more diversified revenue streams, better technological or data analytics capabilities, or stronger brands or\ncompetitive positions in certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. If clients or users prefer our\ncompetitors’ products or services over our own, or if our competitors are better able to adapt to changes in the preferences of advertisers or\nusers, regulations, or other developments, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe advertising ecosystem and mobile gaming are subject to rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately\nallocate our resources among, emerging technologies and business models, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nTechnology changes rapidly in the advertising ecosystem and in mobile gaming. Our future success depends in part on our ability to adapt\nto trends and to innovate. To attract new clients and users and increase revenue from our current clients and users, we may develop new\nproducts or enter into new markets and will need to enhance and improve our Software Platform and Apps. Enhancements of our existing\ntechnology and offerings, and new offerings, may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and may contain errors or defects.\nOur business also currently depends in part on the growth and evolution of the internet, especially mobile internet-enabled devices. The\nnumber of people using mobile internet-enabled devices has increased rapidly over time, and we expect that this trend will continue. However,\nthe advertising ecosystem and mobile gaming may not grow in the way we anticipate. We must continually anticipate and adapt to emerging\ntechnologies to stay competitive, including the development of AI and its impacts on the advertising ecosystem and mobile gaming. As the\ntechnological infrastructure for internet access improves and evolves, consumers will be presented with more opportunities to access apps and\nplay games on a variety of devices and platforms and to experience other leisure activities that may compete with mobile apps. Forecasting the\nfinancial impact of these emerging technologies and business models is inherently uncertain and volatile. If we decide to support a new\ntechnology or business model in the future, it may require partnering with a new platform, technology, or business partner, which may be on\nterms that are less favorable to us than those for traditional technologies or business models.\nTo invest in a new technology, enter a new market or expand our offerings, we must invest financial resources and management attention.\nWe may invest significant resources in a new offering, entering a new market or in a strategic acquisition or partnership, which could prove\nunsuccessful or prevent us from directing these resources towards other opportunities. We may never recover the often-substantial up-\nfront costs of developing and marketing emerging technologies or business models, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and\nfinancial resources. Further, our competitors may adopt an emerging technology or business model more quickly or effectively than we do,\ncreating products that are technologically superior to ours or attract more users than ours.\nIf, on the other hand, we do not continue to enhance our Software Platform or Apps, or do not appropriately allocate our resources\namongst opportunities, or we otherwise elect not to pursue new business models that achieve significant commercial success, we may face\nadverse consequences. For example, we do not currently offer our Apps on all devices or all gaming platforms. If the devices on which our Apps\nare available decline in popularity or become obsolete faster than anticipated, or if new platforms emerge other than those on which our games\nare offered, we could experience a decline in revenue and in our number of App users, and we may not achieve the anticipated return on our\ndevelopment efforts. It may take significant time and expenditures to shift product development resources to new technologies, and it may be\nmore difficult to compete against existing products incorporating such technologies. If new technologies render mobile devices obsolete or we\nare unable to successfully adapt to and appropriately allocate our resources amongst current and new technologies, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur Software Platform and Apps, as well as our internal systems, rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any\nerrors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur Software Platform and Apps, as well as our internal systems, rely on software and hardware, including AI technologies, that are highly\ntechnical and complex. In addition, our Software Platform and Apps, as well as our internal systems, depend in part on the ability of such\nsoftware and hardware to store, retrieve, process, and\n43\nTable of contents\nmanage immense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the future contain, errors, bugs, or\nvulnerabilities and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives. Some errors,\nbugs, or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal\nuse. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within the software and hardware on which we rely have in the past led\nto, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including a negative experience for clients and users who use our offerings, compromised ability of\nour offerings to perform in a manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, delayed product or App launches or enhancements,\ntargeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property, or reductions in our\nability to provide some or all of our services. To the extent such errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects impact our Software Platform or the\naccuracy of data in the Software Platform, our clients may become dissatisfied with our offerings, our brand and reputation may be harmed, and\nwe may make operational decisions, such as with respect to our Apps using such Software Platform or any future strategic acquisition, that are\nbased on inaccurate data. Any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to\nproperly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our\ncommitments to our clients may lead to outcomes including damage to our reputation, increased product engineering expenses, regulatory\ninquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nOur business depends in part on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption to our\nSoftware Platform or Apps could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of engagement, and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nOur reputation and ability to attract and retain our clients and users depends in part on the reliable performance of our Software Platform\nand Apps. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our offerings\nfrom time to time. Our systems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid\nperformance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our offerings are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if\nthey do not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our offerings as often in the future, or at all, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations. As we continue to grow, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network\ncapacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our needs and the needs of our clients and users. It is possible that we may fail to continue\nto effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our user\nengagement and revenue growth. Additionally, we rely on certain third-party providers for our increasing network capacity and computing power\nneeds, and if we fail to properly anticipate our needs or secure sufficient capacity at a reasonable cost, our ability to scale and grow our\nbusiness, or our profitability, could be negatively impacted. Our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from natural\ndisasters and other events outside of our control that impact us or these third-party providers. If such an event were to occur, users may be\nsubject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to\nrestart or provide our services. If we fail to efficiently scale and manage our infrastructure, or if events disrupt our infrastructure or those of our\nthird-party providers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to global economic, market, public health, and geopolitical conditions as well as to natural disasters beyond\nour control and could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nGeneral macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, high interest rates, or a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or\ninternationally, including those resulting from uncertainty in the global banking and financial services markets, political uncertainty and\ninternational conflicts around the world, such as between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, as well as, friction between the United\nStates and China, could create uncertainty and adversely affect discretionary consumer spending habits and preferences as well as advertising\nspending. Our revenue is driven in part by discretionary consumer spending habits and preferences, and by advertising spending patterns.\nHistorically, consumer purchasing and advertising spending have each declined during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty regarding\nfuture economic prospects or when disposable income or consumer lending is lower. In certain periods in 2022, we experienced the impacts of\nthe macroeconomic deterioration as advertisers more closely managed budgets and reduced overall spend, which resulted in slowed growth for\nour Software Platform. Uncertain economic conditions may impact advertiser spending in future periods and may also adversely affect our\nclients, which in turn may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the economic conditions affecting the\nfinancial markets, and uncertainty in global economic conditions may result in a number of adverse effects including a low level of liquidity in\ndomestic and global\n44\nTable of contents\nmarkets, volatility in credit, equity, and currencies and instability in the stock market. There could be a number of other follow-on effects from\nthese economic developments on our business, including customer insolvencies, decreased demand for our marketing solutions; decreased\ncustomer ability to pay their accounts, and increased collections risk and defaults. We are particularly susceptible to market conditions and risks\nassociated with the advertising ecosystem, including changes in user demographics, the availability and popularity of other forms of\nentertainment, and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences, which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted.\nOur business is subject to economic, market, public health, and geopolitical conditions, as well as natural disasters beyond our control. For\nexample, we have a partner studio located in Belarus and we have employees located in Israel and as a result of the international conflict\nbetween Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, we have incurred and are likely to continue to incur costs to support our partner studio and\nemployees and address related challenges. In addition, our management has spent time and attention on these and related events and will\ncontinue to monitor and assess the ongoing disruptions to our team members, our management, and our operations, each of which could\npotentially harm our business. We may also experience interruptions or delays in the services they provide to us as a result of such geopolitical\nvolatilities.\nFurther, we have operations in China and the continuing tension between the U.S. and China may impact our business and results of\noperations in the future. The U.S. government has restricted the ability to send certain products and technology to China without an export\nlicense. In many cases, these licenses are subject to a policy of denial and will not be issued. While our current products are not restricted by\nthese controls, such controls or future restrictions could impact our business in the future. It also is possible that the Chinese government will\nretaliate in ways that could impact our business.\nWhile not currently material to the operation of our business, management and our board of directors have discussed and assessed, and\nwill continue to discuss and assess, any risks related to international conflicts around the world, such as in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well\nas tension between the United States and China, including but not limited to, risks related to cybersecurity, sanctions, regulatory changes, and\npersonnel based in affected regions to ensure we are prepared to react to new developments or further sanctions as they arise. If we are unable\nto promptly or properly react to new developments in these and other international regions, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nOur principal offices are located in Palo Alto, an area known for earthquakes and susceptible to fires, and are thus vulnerable to damage.\nAll of our facilities are also vulnerable to damage from natural or manmade disasters, including power loss, earthquakes, fires, explosions,\nfloods, communications failures, terrorist attacks, contagious disease outbreak (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and similar events. If any\ndisaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be impaired and we could incur significant losses, recovery from\nwhich may require substantial time and expense.\nWe plan to continue to consider opportunities to expand and diversify our operations through strategic acquisitions and partnerships.\nWe face a number of risks related to strategic transactions we may pursue.\nWe will continue to consider opportunities to expand and diversify our operations with additional strategic acquisitions or partnerships,\nstrategic collaborations, joint ventures, or licensing arrangements. As we continue to grow, these transactions may be larger and require\nsignificant investments, such as our acquisitions of Adjust, the MoPub business, and Wurl.\nWe may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions or partnerships for many reasons, including our ability to identify\nsuitable targets, increasing competition from other potential acquirers, the effects of consolidation in our industries, potentially high valuations of\nacquisition candidates, and the availability of financing to complete larger acquisitions. Even if we do complete any such transactions, we may\nincur significant costs, such as professional service fees or publisher bonuses. Further, completing larger acquisitions or other strategic\ntransactions can involve significantly more risk in that such transactions involve complicated integrations and require significant management\nattention to complete, and these large strategic transactions could introduce additional exposure to regulatory and compliance risk. In addition,\napplicable antitrust laws and other regulations may limit our ability to acquire targets, particularly larger targets, or force us to divest an acquired\nbusiness. If we are unable to identify suitable targets or complete acquisitions, or if such acquisitions lead to heightened regulatory or\ncompliance risk, our growth prospects could be adversely affected, and we may not be able to realize sufficient scale and technological\nadvantages to compete effectively in all markets.\nTo complete large strategic transactions, we may need to spend significant amounts of cash, which may not be available to us on\nacceptable terms, if at all, or which could lead us to incur additional debt (and increased\n45\nTable of contents\ninterest expense), assume contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, or write-offs of goodwill and intangible\nassets. In addition, we may need to issue significant amounts of equity or equity-linked consideration, which may dilute our current stockholders’\nownership and could adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock. Further, we generally devote more time and resources towards\nperforming diligence on larger transactions and may be required to devote more resources towards regulatory requirements in connection with\nsuch transactions. To the extent that we do not perform sufficient diligence on a larger acquisition or such a transaction does not generate the\nexpected benefits, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be harmed, and to a greater extent than would occur with a\nsmaller transaction.\nAbsent such strategic transactions, we would need to undertake additional development or commercialization activities at our own\nexpense. If we elect to fund and undertake such additional efforts on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital,\nwhich may not be available to our company on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to do any of the foregoing, we may not be able to\ndevelop our Software Platform and Apps effectively or achieve our expected product roadmap on a timely basis, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe benefits of a strategic acquisition or partnership may also take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any\nparticular strategic acquisition or partnership will produce the intended benefits. If we are unable to identify and complete strategic acquisitions or\npartnerships or realize the anticipated benefits from such transactions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nOur international operations are subject to increased challenges and risks.\nWe expect to continue to expand our international operations in the future by opening new offices, entering into strategic partnerships with\nnew international game studios, acquiring companies that may have international operations, and providing our Apps in additional countries and\nlanguages. For example, our resources are located throughout the world, including in areas with less certain legal and regulatory regimes or\nmore potential risks, such as Belarus, China, Israel and Vietnam and with partners in Russia and Ukraine. Expanding our international\noperations may subject us to risks associated with:\n• recruiting and retaining talented and capable management and employees in foreign countries;\n• challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;\n• developing and customizing Software Platform and Apps that appeal to the tastes and preferences of users in international markets;\n• the inability to offer certain Software Platform or Apps in certain foreign countries;\n• competition from local mobile app developers with intellectual property rights and significant market share in those markets and with\na better understanding of user preferences;\n• utilizing, protecting, defending, and enforcing our intellectual property rights;\n• negotiating agreements with local distribution platforms that are sufficiently economically beneficial to us and protective of our rights;\n• the inability to extend proprietary rights in our brand, content, or technology into new jurisdictions;\n• implementing alternative payment methods for features and virtual goods in a manner that complies with local laws and practices\nand protects us from fraud;\n• compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, including anti-bribery laws, privacy laws, AI laws, and laws relating to\ncontent and consumer protection (for example, the United Kingdom’s Office of Fair Trading’s 2014 principles relating to IAPs in free-\nto-play games that are directed toward children 16 and under);\n• credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n• currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n• protectionist laws and business practices that favor local businesses in certain countries;\n• double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the tax laws in the United\nStates or the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;\n• political, economic, macro-economic climate and social instability, including impacts related to labor, supply chain disruptions,\ninflation, and as a result of war, terrorism, or armed conflict, including\n46\nTable of contents\ninternational conflicts around the world, such as between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, as well as, increasing friction\nbetween the United States and China and the impacts on their respective regions and the regional and global economy;\n• public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which can result in varying impacts to our employees, clients, users,\nadvertisers, app developers, and business partners internationally;\n• higher costs associated with doing business internationally, including costs related to local advisors;\n• export or import regulations; and\n• trade and tariff restrictions.\nOur ability to successfully gain market acceptance in any particular international market is uncertain and, in the past, we have experienced\ndifficulties and have not been successful in all the countries we have entered. If we are unable to continue to expand internationally or manage\nthe complexity of our global operations successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced significant growth through strategic acquisitions and partnerships, and we face risks related to the integration\nof such acquisitions and the management of such growth.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have frequently acquired companies, businesses, personnel, and technologies, and we intend to\ncontinue to evaluate and pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships. For example, we acquired Adjust GmbH in April 2021, Twitter's MoPub\nbusiness in January 2022 and Wurl, Inc. in April 2022. Each acquisition requires unique approaches to integration due to, among other reasons,\nthe structure of the acquisition, the size, locations, and cultural differences among their team and ours, and has required, and will continue to\nrequire, attention from our management team. As we continue to grow, the size of our acquisitions and investments has increased and may\ncontinue to increase. In addition to the larger purchase prices associated with such acquisitions and investments, larger acquisitions and\ninvestments may also require additional management resources to integrate more significant and often more complex businesses into our\ncompany. We will continue to explore and evaluate additional acquisitions, some of which may be the same size or even larger in scale and\ninvestment than our recent acquisitions.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to integrate these acquisitions and manage these businesses, partnerships, and\ntransactions effectively. If we are unable to obtain the anticipated benefits or synergies of such acquisitions, or we encounter difficulties\nintegrating acquired businesses with ours, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChallenges and risks from such strategic acquisitions and partnerships include:\n• diversion of our management’s attention in the acquisition and integration process, including oversight over acquired businesses\nwhich continue their operations under contingent consideration provisions in acquisition agreements;\n• declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in compensation or benefits, or changes in management,\nreporting relationships, or future performance;\n• the need to integrate the operations, systems, technologies, products, and personnel of each acquired company, the inefficiencies\nand lack of control that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures\nthat may arise in connection with integration;\n• costs associated with onboarding clients of an acquired business;\n• the need to implement internal controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger, U.S.-based public company at companies\nthat prior to acquisition may not have as robust controls, procedures, and policies, in particular, with respect to the effectiveness of\ninternal controls, cyber and information security practices and incident response plans, compliance with privacy, data protection, and\nother regulations protecting the rights of clients and users, and compliance with U.S.-based economic policies and sanctions which\nmay not have previously been applicable to the acquired company’s operations;\n• the difficulty in accurately forecasting and accounting for the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting\ncharges, write-offs of deferred revenue under purchase accounting, and integrating and reporting results for acquired companies\nthat have not historically followed GAAP;\n• the implementation of restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies;\n47\nTable of contents\n• the fact that we may be required to pay contingent consideration in excess of the initial fair value, and contingent consideration may\nbecome payable at a time when we do not have sufficient cash available to pay such consideration;\n• in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the\nparticular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries as well as tax risks that may arise\nfrom the acquisition;\n• increasing legal, regulatory, and compliance exposure, and the additional costs related to mitigate each of those, as a result of\nadding new offices, employees and other service providers, benefit plans, equity, job types, and lines of business globally; and\n• liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including intellectual property, commercial, and other litigation\nclaims or disputes, cyber and information security vulnerabilities, violations of laws, rules and regulations, including with respect to\nemployee classification, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate and manage our acquisitions and strategic partnerships, we may not realize the expected\nbenefits of such transactions or become exposed to additional liabilities, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nOur strategic review of our Apps portfolio may not result in sustained improvements to our financial performance, strategy, or\noperations, and we face a number of risks related to such review.\nWe continue to optimize our Apps portfolio and its cost structure, focusing on identifying those assets which contribute value and how best\nto optimize each of those asset’s contribution to our overall financial performance. This review resulted in the divestiture or closure of certain\nstudios, a reduction of headcount, restructuring of earn out arrangements, and other changes to our Apps portfolio, such as restructuring of\ncertain assets or choosing to make changes to optimize the cost structure of certain Apps rather than investing in revenue growth. For example,\nwe have reduced our user acquisition spend for our portfolio of Apps as we increased our desired return goals, which has led to improved Apps\nAdjusted EBITDA margin compared to periods before such adjustments, but also contributed to a decline in Apps revenue and Monthly Active\nPayers (\"MAPs\") compared to periods before such adjustments. In addition, our strategic review and any restructuring actions may lead to\nclaims being made on behalf of affected employees, which could result in complaints by current and former employees, adverse media\ncoverage, investigations, and damages or penalties which could affect our reputation, business, and results of operations. In addition,\nresponding to any such proceeding may result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources, significant defense costs, and\nother professional fees. We may not achieve the desired strategic, operational, and financial benefits of any divestiture or other strategic\ntransaction, or any other action taken as a result of our strategic review, and we may incur near term impacts to our results of operations due to\nour strategic review. For example, in 2022 we incurred $127.9 million in impairment and loss in connection with the sale of certain assets\nresulting from our strategic review of the Apps portfolio. As a result of this review, we may be subject to risks related to a decline in the business\nor employee morale and turnover, as well as distraction of management from our business and customers, and investors may not react favorably\nto our decisions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and the market price of our Class A common stock. If our\nstrategic review does not result in our proposed outcomes or meet our strategic objectives, our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition could be adversely affected.\nWe continue to carefully consider the full range of options to optimize our Apps portfolio and maximize value to our shareholders, including\nperiodically evaluating potential transactions with third parties related to our Apps portfolio and other strategic and financial alternatives.\nHowever, we can provide no assurance that any transaction with a third party or other strategic alternative, if pursued, will have a positive impact\non our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur strategic acquisitions and partnerships may expose us to tax risks.\nFrom time to time, we have acquired and may acquire companies, assets, businesses, and technologies and we have entered into and\nmay enter into other strategic partnerships and transactions. We face a variety of tax risks related to such transactions, including that we may be\nrequired to make tax withholdings in various jurisdictions in connection with such transactions or as part of our continuing operations following a\ntransaction, and that the companies or businesses we acquire may cause us to alter our international tax structure or otherwise create more\ncomplexity with respect to tax matters. Additionally, while we typically include indemnification provisions in our definitive agreements related to\nstrategic acquisitions and partnerships, these indemnification provisions may be insufficient in the event that tax liabilities are greater than\nexpected or in areas that are not fully covered by\n48\nTable of contents\nindemnification. If we are unable to adequately predict and address such tax issues as they arise, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into strategic partnerships with mobile gaming studios, and a failure to maintain such relationships may harm our\nability to launch new Apps as well as our brand and reputation.\nFrom time to time, we have entered into strategic partnerships with mobile gaming studios in addition to those studios that are wholly-\nowned. We have historically allowed our strategic partner studios to continue their operations with a degree of autonomy. In certain of these\ntransactions, we have bought games from such partner studios and entered into development agreements whereby such partner studios provide\nus support in developing and improving games. These agreements typically have a fixed term, after which our partner studios may choose not to\ncontinue working with us. Any deterioration in our relationship with partner studios may harm our ability to monetize the games we purchase or\ndevelop and launch future mobile games developed by partner studios and may lead to such partner studios choosing not to renew their\npartnerships with us or continue to develop new games or support existing games. Further, if a partner studio becomes dissatisfied with us, our\nbrand and reputation may be harmed and we may have more difficulty entering into similar partnerships in the future. Additionally, our\ninternational partner studios may be located in areas with less certain legal and regulatory regimes or more potential risks, which may increase\nour costs to maintain such strategic partnership. If we are unable to maintain any of these partnerships, we may be required to invest significant\nresources in expanding our other studios or entering into agreements with additional mobile gaming studios in order to continue producing the\nsame volume and quality of Apps, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to launch or acquire new Apps and successfully monetize them, or continue to improve the experience and\nmonetization of our existing Apps, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur Apps portfolio depends in part on launching or acquiring, and continuing to service, mobile apps that users will download and spend\ntime and money using. We have devoted and we may in the future continue to devote substantial resources to the research, development,\nanalytics, and marketing of our Apps. Our development and marketing efforts are focused on improving the experience of our existing Apps,\ndeveloping new Apps, and successfully monetizing our Apps. Our Apps generate revenue primarily through the sale of advertising, a substantial\nportion of which comes from other mobile gaming clients, and IAPs. For Apps distributed through third-party platforms, we are required to share\na portion of the proceeds from in-game sales with the platform providers, which share may be subject to changes or increases over time. In\norder to achieve and maintain our profitability, we need to generate sufficient revenue from our existing and new Apps to offset our ongoing\ndevelopment, marketing, and other operating expenses.\nSuccessfully monetizing our Apps is difficult and requires that we deliver user experiences that a sufficient number of users will pay for\nthrough IAPs or we are able to otherwise sufficiently monetize our Apps, including by serving IAA. The success of our Apps depends in part on\nunpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control including user preferences, competing apps, new third-party platforms, and the availability\nof other entertainment experiences. If our Apps do not meet user expectations or if they are not brought to market in a timely and effective\nmanner, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully launch or acquire Apps and their ability to achieve commercial success will depend in part on our\nability to:\n• effectively and efficiently market our Apps to existing and new users;\n• achieve a positive return on investment from our marketing and user acquisition costs or achieve organic user growth;\n• adapt to changing trends, user preferences, new technologies, and new feature sets for mobile and other devices, including\ndetermining whether to invest in development for any new technologies, and achieve a positive return on the costs associated with\nsuch adaptation;\n• continue to adapt mobile app feature sets for an increasingly diverse set of mobile devices, including various operating systems and\nspecifications, limited bandwidth, and varying processing power and screen sizes;\n• achieve and maintain successful user engagement and effectively monetize our Apps;\n• develop mobile games that can build upon or become franchise games and expand and enhance our mobile games after their initial\nreleases;\n49\nTable of contents\n• develop Apps other than mobile games;\n• identify and execute strategic acquisitions and partnerships;\n• attract advertisers to advertise on our Apps;\n• partner with third-party platforms and obtain featuring opportunities;\n• compete successfully against a large and growing number of competitors;\n• accurately forecast the timing and expense of our operations, including mobile app and feature development, marketing, and user\nacquisition;\n• minimize and quickly resolve bugs or outages;\n• acquire, or invest in, and successfully integrate high quality mobile app companies or technologies;\n• retain and motivate talented and experienced developers and other key personnel from such acquisitions and investments; and\n• optimize the value of our Apps portfolio, including actions we may take that reduce Apps revenue in order to seek higher margins\nand the effects of the review on morale and personnel.\nThese and other uncertainties make it difficult to know whether we will succeed in continuing to develop and launch new Apps. Even if\nsuccessful, certain genres of mobile apps, such as casual games, may have a relatively short lifespan. Further, as our Apps expand into\nadditional genres of mobile games or additional categories of mobile apps, we will face risks as well as market, legal and regulatory challenges\nspecific to those genres or categories. For example, in mid-core games, there is typically a higher upfront investment prior to the launch of a\ngame compared to casual games, which means publishing a new game in that genre will expose us to greater risks as our financial condition\nand results of operations will be more significantly adversely affected to the extent such a game does not become popular and commercially\nsuccessful. If we are not successful in launching new mobile games or expanding into other genres of mobile games or categories of mobile\napps, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users cost-effectively, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with Apps, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe size of our user base and the level of user engagement with our Apps are critical to our success. Our results of operations have been\nand will continue to be significantly determined by our success in acquiring and engaging App users. We expect that the number of our App\nusers may fluctuate or decline as a result of apps divestitures or other actions we have taken in connection with our review of our Apps portfolio,\nor in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates or where the\nmacroeconomic conditions have been negatively impacted. For example, we have reduced our user acquisition spend for our portfolio of Apps\nas we increased our desired return goals, which has contributed to a decline in MAPs compared to periods before such adjustments. In addition,\nif people do not perceive our Apps as useful or entertaining, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the\nfrequency and duration of their engagement, which could harm our revenue. A number of mobile apps that achieved early popularity have since\nseen their user bases or user engagement levels decline. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our App users or\nuser engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly\nas we introduce new and different Apps. Any number of factors can adversely affect user growth and engagement, including if:\n• users increasingly engage with mobile apps offered by competitors or mobile apps in categories other than those of our Apps;\n• we fail to introduce new Apps or features that users find engaging or that achieve a high level of market acceptance or we introduce\nnew Apps, or make changes to existing Apps that are not favorably received;\n• users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, format,\nsize, and quality of advertisements that we display;\n• users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our Apps as a result of actions by us or third parties;\n• we are unable to continue to develop Apps that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and\n50\nTable of contents\nnetworks; and\n• questions about the quality of our Apps, our data practices or concerns related to privacy and sharing of personal information and\nother user data, safety, security, or other factors.\nAdditionally, we expect it will become increasingly difficult and more expensive for us to acquire users for our Apps for a variety of reasons,\nincluding the increasingly competitive nature of the mobile app ecosystem and the significant amount of time and attention users are dedicating\nto competing entertainment options. Further, we believe that the changes that Apple has implemented during the last several years to its\nplatform, particularly the removal of the Top Grossing rankings and decreasing the prominence of the Top Free rankings as well as transparency\nand IDFA changes, have adversely affected the number of organic downloads of our Apps. If our competitors increase their user acquisition\nspending, we could experience higher costs per an install for our Apps, which would adversely affect our revenue and margins. Furthermore, our\nspending on user acquisition is based on certain assumptions about their projected behavior, particularly for new Apps for which we do not have\nsimilar Apps in our portfolio to aid us in our modeling efforts. If we are unable to grow our user base and increase our user engagement levels, or\nunable to do so cost effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur revenue has been concentrated in various ways and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, any such revenue source, or our\nfailure to successfully expand and diversify our revenue sources could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe have historically experienced revenue concentration with respect to certain Apps as well as other facets of our business. Our future\nsuccess depends, in part, on launching or acquiring and successfully monetizing additional Apps and on establishing and maintaining successful\nrelationships with a diverse set of clients. While our Apps consist of over 200 mobile games, currently a limited number of those are responsible\nfor a significant portion of our revenue. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, two games, Wordscapes and Project Makeover,\ncollectively represented approximately 9% of our revenue. The loss or failure to successfully monetize one of these Apps could have a significant\nimpact on our results of operations. Similarly, our future success depends, in part, on our ability to launch and monetize additional mobile games\nand other mobile apps, as well as, on our ability to successfully acquire and monetize additional mobile games and other mobile apps, and these\nApps may not successfully diversify our revenue concentration. If we are unable to successfully launch or acquire new Apps, our reliance on a\nlimited number of Apps may increase. Additionally, certain genres of games typically rely on only a small portion of their total users for a\nsignificant amount of their revenue, and as we expand our number of Apps in these genres, such as mid-core, we may experience these effects\nand need to attract, engage, and increase the spending levels of these particular users to achieve success.\nMore generally, we face concentration risk in that our Software Platform and Apps operate in the mobile app ecosystem and specifically\nmobile gaming. As such, our business depends, in part, on the continued health and growth of these app ecosystems, which have been\nadversely affected in recent periods by global macroeconomic conditions. Further, a significant amount of our total revenue is derived through a\nlimited number of third-party distribution platforms, such as the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook. Because Facebook and\nGoogle are also significant partners of Adjust, a deterioration in our or Adjust’s relationship with such companies would have a greater impact on\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations. If any of these concentrated portions of our revenue are harmed or are lost, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced recent rapid growth, which may not be indicative of our future growth. We may be unable to effectively manage\nthe growth of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in the scale, scope, and complexity of our business. For example, our Software Platform revenue has\nexpanded rapidly, in particular since the launch of our AI-powered advertising recommendation engine, AXON. Our growth in any prior period\nshould not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance, as we may not be able to sustain our growth rate in the future. Even if our\nrevenue continues to increase, we expect that our revenue growth rate may decline in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including\nbecause of more difficult comparisons to prior periods and the saturation of the market. The overall growth of our revenue depends in part on our\nability to execute on our growth strategies.\nAdditionally, the growth and expansion of our business has placed and continues to place a significant strain on our management,\noperations, financial infrastructure, and corporate culture. Our future success depends in part on our ability to manage this expanded business. If\nnot managed effectively, this growth could result in the over-\n51\nTable of contents\nextension of our management systems and information technology systems and our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to\nsupport this growth. Failure to adequately manage our growth in any of these ways may cause damage to our brand and reputation and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur future growth may involve expansion into new business opportunities, and any efforts to do so that are unsuccessful or are not\ncost-effective could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn the past, we have grown by expanding our offerings into new business opportunities and we expect to continue to do so. We have\ndedicated resources to expanding into adjacent business opportunities in which large competitors have an established presence. Additionally,\nour future growth may include expansion into additional features for mobile apps, other mobile app sectors, e-commerce or social or related\nmarkets, connected TV markets through our 2022 Wurl acquisition, OEM and carrier-related markets through our Array product initiative, or other\nopportunities which may require significant investment in order to launch and which may not be prove successful. Further, any such expansion\nmay subject us to new or additional laws and regulations, compliance with which may be burdensome and costly. Our future growth depends in\npart on our ability to correctly identify areas of investment and to cost-effectively execute on our plans. For example, we generate revenue\nthrough our recently acquired Wurl CTV business which provides streaming content distribution and advertising services. The market for CTV\nplatforms is relatively new and evolving and this market may develop slower or differently than we expect. There can be no assurance that the\nevolution of CTV and its content and services will continue to grow or that we can successfully navigate any shifts in consumer demand in this\nmarket.\nWe have in the past and may in the future expend significant resources in connection with strategic acquisitions and partnerships to\nexpand into new business opportunities. Even if successful, the growth of any new business opportunity could create significant challenges for\nour management and operational resources and could require considerable investment. The deployment of significant resources towards a new\nopportunity that proves unsuccessful, or our inability to choose the correct investment opportunities for our future, could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business depends in part on our ability to increase IAPs, manage the economies in our Apps and respond to changes with\nrespect to IAPs, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur Apps portfolio depends in part on our ability to increase the amount of IAPs in our Apps, which requires our studios to effectively\ndesign mobile games and other apps that create features and virtual goods for which users will pay. Users make IAPs because of the\nperceived in-app value of virtual goods, which is dependent on the relative ease of obtaining an equivalent good by playing our mobile games.\nThe perceived in-app value of these virtual goods can be impacted by various actions that we take in the mobile games including offering\ndiscounts for virtual goods, giving away virtual goods in promotions, or providing easier non-paid means to secure these goods. Managing virtual\neconomies is difficult and relies on our assumptions and judgement. Further, changes in user preferences, including with respect to how they\ninteract with mobile apps and general views towards IAPs, could decrease levels of spending on IAPs on our Apps and in the mobile app\necosystem generally. If we fail to manage our virtual economies properly or fail to promptly and successfully respond to any disruption in such\neconomies, our reputation may be harmed and our users may be less likely to play our mobile games and to purchase virtual goods from us in\nthe future, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, changes in the policies of Apple, Google, or other third-party platforms, or changes in accounting policies promulgated by the\nSEC, and national accounting standards bodies affecting software and virtual goods revenue recognition, could further significantly affect the\nway we report revenue related to IAPs, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Any changes in user, third-party platform, or\nregulator views towards IAPs, or any inability by us to respond to changing trends with respect to IAPs, could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain our profitability in any\ngiven period. If we cannot achieve or maintain our profitability, our business could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we have been profitable on a GAAP basis and had positive cash flow from operations in certain prior periods, we may not always\nachieve sufficient revenue or manage our expenses in order to achieve positive cash flow from operations or profitability in any given period. Our\noperating expenses may continue to rise over the long term as we implement additional initiatives designed to increase revenue, potentially\nincluding: developing our\n52\nTable of contents\nSoftware Platform and technology stack, launching Apps, strategic acquisitions and partnerships, international expansion, hiring additional\nemployees, and taking other steps to strengthen and grow our company. We are likely to recognize costs associated with these investments\nearlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect.\nWe also anticipate that the costs of acquiring new clients and mobile app users, and otherwise marketing our Software Platform and Apps, will\ncontinue to rise. Further, we may continue to incur significant costs in connection with strategic acquisitions and partnerships, which costs may\nincrease or become more concentrated to the extent we enter into larger transactions. If we are not able to maintain positive cash flow in the\nlong term, we may require additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and which may be dilutive to our\nstockholders. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may incur significant losses in the future\nand may not be able to maintain positive cash flow from operations or profitability.\nWe generally do not have long-term agreements with our clients.\nOur clients are not required to enter into long-term agreements with us and may choose to stop using our Software Platform at any time.\nFor example, typically our advertising agreements can be executed in as little as one day and can be terminated for convenience on two days’\nnotice. In order to continue to grow our Software Platform, we must consistently provide offerings that clients see as valuable and choose to use.\nIf we fail to maintain our relationships with our clients, or if the terms of these relationships become less favorable to us, our results of operations\nwould be harmed. Additionally, as certain of our clients are also our competitors, these clients may choose to invest in their own offerings rather\nthan continue to use our Software Platform. Any failure to maintain our relationships with clients could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nIf our Apps do not meet user expectations, or contain objectionable content, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nExpectations regarding the quality, performance, and integrity of our Apps are high. We must continually adapt to changing user\npreferences including the popularity of various game categories, style of play, and IAP options. Users may be critical of our Apps, business\nmodels, or business practices for a wide variety of reasons, including perceptions about gameplay, fairness, game content, features, or services.\nIndependent industry analysts may publish reviews of our Apps from time to time, as well as those of our competitors, and perception of our\nApps in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. We have no control over what users or these industry analysts report.\nIf users and industry analysts negatively respond to our Apps or changes that we make to our Apps, or provide negative reviews of our Apps, our\nreputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFurther, despite reasonable precautions, some users may be offended by certain mobile app content, advertisements displayed in our\nApps or by the treatment of other users. For example, if users believe that an advertisement displayed in an App contains objectionable content,\nwe could experience damage to our brand and reputation and users could refuse to play such game and pressure platform providers to remove\nthe App from their platforms. While such content may violate our terms and we may subsequently remove it, our brand and reputation may\nnonetheless be harmed and our clients may become dissatisfied with our services. Furthermore, steps that we may take in response to such\ninstances, such as temporarily or permanently shutting off access of a user to our Apps, could adversely affect our business and results of\noperations. Any failure to meet user expectations or provide our Apps without objectionable content could adversely affect our reputation,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, our business could be\nharmed.\nWe believe that our company culture has been critical to our success and will be important for our continued growth. We face a number of\nchallenges that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including: failure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership\npositions in our organization who share and further our culture and values; the increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our culture and values; the continued challenges of a rapidly-evolving\nindustry; the increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us; a negative perception of our treatment of employees\nor our response to employee sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; and the integration of new personnel and\nbusinesses from acquisitions. If we are not able to maintain our culture, we could lose the innovation, passion, and dedication of our team and as\na result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n53\nTable of contents\nIf we do not successfully or cost-effectively invest in, establish, and maintain awareness of the AppLovin brand, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that establishing and maintaining the AppLovin brand is critical to maintaining and creating favorable relationships with, and\nour ability to attract, new clients, and key personnel. Increasing awareness of the AppLovin brand will depend largely upon our marketing efforts\nand our ability to successfully differentiate our Software Platform from the offerings of our competitors. In addition, successfully globalizing and\nextending our brand requires significant investment and extensive management time. If we fail to maintain and increase brand awareness and\nrecognition of our Software Platform, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have made public commitments to our corporate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and human capital management\ninitiatives, including our environmental impact towards a sustainable future. Any perceived changes in our dedication to these commitments or\nour failure to achieve progress in these areas could adversely impact our relationships with our customers and employees, affect our reputation\nand the value of our brand.\nThe proliferation of “cheating” programs and scam offers that seek to exploit our mobile games and users may adversely affect game-\nplaying experiences and lead users to stop playing our mobile games. Our failure to maintain a customer support ecosystem may\nenhance these risks.\nOur users rely on our customer support organization to resolve any issues relating to our mobile games. Customer support is important for\nsatisfying user expectations regarding the quality, performance, and integrity of our mobile games. We currently have limited customer support\noperations. If we do not effectively train, supplement, and manage our customer support organization to assist our users, and if that support\norganization does not succeed in helping users quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing support, we could experience decreased user\nengagement and harm to our reputation with potential new users.\nAdditionally, unrelated third parties have developed, and may continue to develop, “cheating” programs that enable users to exploit\nvulnerabilities in our mobile games, play them in an automated way, collude to alter the intended game play, or obtain unfair advantages over\nother users who do play fairly. These programs harm the experience of users who play fairly and may disrupt the virtual economies of our mobile\ngames and reduce the demand for certain IAPs. In addition, unrelated third parties have attempted to scam our users with fake offers for virtual\ngoods or other game benefits. These unauthorized or fraudulent transactions are usually arranged on third-party websites and the virtual goods\noffered may have been obtained through unauthorized means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in our mobile games, or may be fraudulent\noffers. We do not generate any revenue from these transactions. These unauthorized purchases and sales from third-party sellers have in the\npast and could in the future impede our revenue and profit growth.\nThere can be no assurance that our customer support and other efforts to detect, prevent, or minimize these unauthorized or fraudulent\ntransactions will be successful, that these actions will not increase over time or that our customer support efforts will be successful in resolving\nuser issues. Any failure to maintain adequate customer support or success of third-party cheating programs or scams may negatively affect\ngame-playing experiences and lead users to stop playing our mobile games, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nThird parties with whom we do business may be unable to honor their obligations to us or their actions may put us at risk.\nWe rely on third parties for various aspects of our business, including demand-side platforms, agencies, advertising partners, and\npublishers who use our Software Platform. Their actions may violate our contracts, policies, and applicable laws and regulations, or may\notherwise put our business and reputation at risk. Demand-side platforms may be given access to personal information in order to bid on\nadvertising inventory, and they may misappropriate and engage in unauthorized use of our information, technology or customers' data. In\nviolation of our policies, advertisers may enable the serving of ads that contain prohibited, restricted, or inappropriate content, or content that\notherwise fails to adhere to country-specific laws, rules, or regulations. We also work with advertisers that operate sports gambling apps, apps\nthat involve real money gambling, and apps in other regulated industries and markets, each of which imposes additional regulatory requirements\non these advertisers, which they may not comply with. A vast amount of publishers attempt to use our Software Platform, a number of which may\nattempt to monetize prohibited, restricted, or inappropriate content, or may engage or attempt to engage in fraudulent or other unlawful activity in\nviolation of our policies, which in turn imposes additional operational costs to protect our platform, may trigger additional law enforcement or\nother inquiries, may put our reputation at risk, and may\n54\nTable of contents\notherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe failure of these third parties to provide or maintain adequate services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business\noperations. Further, disruptions in the mobile application industry or financial markets, economic downturns, and poor business decisions may\nadversely affect our partners and may increase their propensity to engage in fraud or other unlawful activity which could harm our business or\nreputation, and they may not be able to honor their obligations to us, or we may cease our arrangements with them.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe are subject to laws and regulations concerning privacy, information security, data protection, consumer protection, advertising,\ntracking, targeting, and protection of minors, and these laws and regulations are continually evolving. Our actual or perceived failure\nto comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe receive, store, and process personal information and other data, including data relating to individuals and households, and we enable\nour users to share their personal information with each other and with third parties, including within our Apps. There are numerous federal, state,\nand local laws around the world regarding privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, deletion, and protection of\npersonal information and other data, including data relating to individuals and households, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing\ninterpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other rules.\nVarious government and consumer agencies have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices and are continuing to review\nthe need for greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer behavior on the internet, including regulation aimed at\nrestricting certain targeted advertising practices. For example, the GDPR, which became effective in May 2018, created new individual privacy\nrights and imposed worldwide obligations on companies processing personal data of European Union (\"EU\") users, which has created a greater\ncompliance burden for us and other companies with European users, and subjects violators to substantial monetary penalties. The United\nKingdom has implemented legislation that substantially implements the GDPR and which also provides for substantial monetary penalties. In\nJune 2021, the European Commission announced a decision of “adequacy” concluding that the United Kingdom ensures an equivalent level of\ndata protection to the GDPR, which provides some relief regarding the legality of continued personal data flows from the European Economic\nArea to the United Kingdom. Such adequacy decision must, however, be renewed after four years and may be modified or revoked in the\ninterim. In October 2022, the United Kingdom announced its plans to depart from the GDPR and implement its own framework. We cannot fully\npredict how United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations may develop in the medium to longer term, nor the effects of divergent laws and\nguidance regarding how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated.\nWith regard to transfers to the United States of personal data (as such term is used in the GDPR and applicable EU member state\nlegislation) from our employees and European users and other third parties, we historically relied upon the EU-U.S. and Swiss-\nU.S. Privacy Shield as well as certain standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission (the \"SCCs\"); however, both the EU-\nU.S. Privacy Shield and the SCCs have been subject to legal challenge, and on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU, Europe’s highest\ncourt, held in the Schrems II case that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield was invalid, and imposed obligations in connection with the use of the SCCs.\nEU regulators since have issued guidance regarding these obligations that we and other companies must consider and undertake when using\nthe SCCs. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission adopted new SCCs, taking into account the Schrems II case and reflecting requirements\nunder the GDPR. Additionally, the United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office has issued new standard contractual clauses required to\nreplace prior standard contractual clauses as of March 21, 2024. Further, in the European Economic Area, the Austrian, French, Italian, and\nDanish data protection authorities have indicated that use of Google Analytics by European website operators involves the unlawful transfer of\npersonal data to the United States. In March 2022, the EU and U.S. announced an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy\nFramework (“EU-U.S. DPF”). On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the EU-U.S. DPF,\nallowing the EU-U.S. DPF to be utilized as a means of legitimizing EU-U.S. personal data transfers for participating entities. The United Kingdom\nand U.S. also have established a UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (the “UK Extension”), effective October 12, 2023, whereby entities\nparticipating in the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension, may rely upon the UK Extension as a means to legitimize United Kingdom-U.S. personal\ndata transfers. Further, on July 17, 2023, the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”), which provides for a means of legitimizing\npersonal data transfers from Switzerland to the U.S., entered into effect. We are self-certified under the EU-U.S. DPF, Swiss-U.S. DPF, and the\nUK Extension. The EU-U.S. DPF has faced legal challenge, and it and the Swiss-U.S. DPF and UK Extension may be subject to further legal\nchallenges from privacy advocacy groups or others, and the European\n55\nTable of contents\nCommission’s adequacy decision regarding the EU-U.S. DPF provides that the EU-U.S. DPF will be subject to future reviews and may be\nsubject to suspension, amendment, repeal, or limitations to its scope by the European Commission. The SCCs and other cross-border data\ntransfer mechanisms may also be the subject of additional legislative activity and regulatory guidance. We and many other companies may need\nto implement different or additional measures to establish or maintain legitimate means for the transfer and receipt of personal data from the\nEuropean Economic Area, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions to the United States, and we may, in addition to other impacts,\nexperience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens, and we and our clients face the potential for regulators to apply\ndifferent standards to the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions to\nthe United States, and to block, or require ad hoc verification of measures taken with respect to, certain data flows. We also may be required to\nengage in contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing data on our behalf, to the extent that any of our service providers, or\nconsultants have been relying on invalidated or insufficient contractual protections for compliance with evolving interpretations of and guidance\nfor cross-border data transfers pursuant to the GDPR or other privacy laws. In such cases, we may not be able to find alternative service\nproviders which could limit our ability to process personal data from the European Economic Area, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, or other\nimpacted jurisdictions and increase our costs and/or impact our Software Platform, Apps, or other offerings. We and our clients may face a risk\nof enforcement actions by data protection authorities relating to personal data transfers. Any such enforcement actions could result in substantial\ncosts and diversion of resources, distract management and technical personnel, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Similar to the GDPR, in September 2020, Brazil enacted the Brazilian General Data Protection Law. China has enacted a\nnew data privacy law known as PIPL, effective November 1, 2021, which adopts a stringent data transfer regime requiring, among other things,\ndata subject consent for certain data transfers. Any of these developments may have an adverse effect on our business.\nMoreover, the GDPR and other similar regulations require companies to give specific types of notice and in some cases seek consent from\nconsumers and other data subjects before collecting or using their data for certain purposes, including some marketing activities. In addition to\nthe GDPR, the European Commission has another draft regulation in the approval process that focuses on a person’s right to conduct a private\nlife. The proposed legislation, known as the Regulation of Privacy and Electronic Communications (\"ePrivacy Regulation\"), would replace the\ncurrent ePrivacy Directive. Originally planned to be adopted and implemented at the same time as the GDPR, the ePrivacy Regulation is still\nbeing negotiated. On February 10, 2021, the Council of the EU agreed on its version of the draft ePrivacy Regulation. If adopted, ePrivacy\nRegulation could have broad impacts on the use of internet-based services and tracking technologies, such as cookies. Aspects of the ePrivacy\nRegulation remain for negotiation between the European Commission and the Council.\nAnother example is California’s passage of the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, and created new privacy rights for users\nresiding in the state, including a private right of action for data breaches. The CPRA was approved by California voters in November 2020, went\ninto effect on January 1, 2023, and significantly modifies the CCPA, resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and\nexpenses in an effort to comply. Additionally, other states in the U.S. have proposed or enacted laws addressing privacy and cybersecurity, many\nof which are comprehensive statutes containing obligations similar to the CCPA and CPRA, that have taken effect or will take effect in coming\nyears. Certain of these laws provide for private rights of action, which may increase the likelihood of class action litigation, that could also\nadversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. The U.S. federal government is also contemplating\nfederal privacy legislation. Our efforts to comply with existing and future legal requirements have required us and will continue to require us to\ndevote significant operational resources and incur significant expenses. Our privacy and data protection compliance and oversight efforts will\nrequire significant time and attention from our management and board of directors.\nFurther, children’s privacy has been a focus of recent enforcement activities and subjects our business to potential liability that could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. Enforcement of COPPA, which requires companies to obtain parental\nconsent before collecting personal information from children known to be under the age of thirteen or from child-directed websites or online\nservices, has increased in recent years. In addition, the GDPR prohibits certain processing of the personal information of children under the age\nof thirteen to sixteen (depending on jurisdiction) without parental consent where consent is used as the lawful basis for processing that personal\ninformation. The CCPA, as amended and supplemented by the CPRA, requires companies to obtain the consent of children in California under\nthe age of sixteen (or parental consent for children under the age of thirteen) before selling their personal information. There also may be various\nlaws, regulations, industry standards, codes of conduct, or other actual or asserted obligations relating to children’s privacy to which we may be,\nor be asserted to be, subject, or that may otherwise impact our business and operations. For example, the United Kingdom’s Age Appropriate\nDesign Code (\"AADC\") is one such regulatory framework that has been adopted\n56\nTable of contents\nin the United Kingdom that focuses on online safety and protection of children’s privacy online, and similar frameworks are being considered for\nadoption in other jurisdictions. Although we take reasonable efforts to comply with applicable laws and regulations and certain other standards,\nwe may in the future face claims under COPPA, the GDPR, the CCPA, the CPRA, or other laws, regulations, or other actual or asserted\nobligations relating to children’s privacy.\nAll of our mobile games are subject to privacy policies and terms of service located in application storefronts, within our mobile games, and\non our respective websites. We endeavor to comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our privacy-related obligations and\ncommitments to users and third parties. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations, and certain industry codes of\nconduct relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent reasonably attainable. However, it is possible that these or other actual or asserted\nobligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one\njurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. It is also possible that new laws, policies, legal obligations, or industry\ncodes of conduct may be passed, or existing laws, policies, legal obligations, or industry codes of conduct may be interpreted in such a way that\ncould prevent us from being able to offer services to residents of a certain jurisdiction or may make it costlier or more difficult for us to do so. Any\nfailure or perceived failure by us to comply with our terms of service or privacy policy, or with applicable laws, regulations, or legal, contractual, or\nother actual or asserted obligations to users or third parties, concerning privacy, information security, data protection, consumer protection, or\nprotection of minors; or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of\npersonal information or other user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions or other proceedings, claims, demands, and litigation\nby private parties, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our users to lose trust in us, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as users,\ndevelopers, vendors, service providers, or other business partners violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our users’\ninformation at risk and could in turn adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing, which could subject us\nto claims or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, and it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be\nadopted or construed to apply to us in the United States and elsewhere that could affect our business and restrict the advertising ecosystem or\ndevelopment of our technologies, including state and federal laws regarding antitrust, consumer protection, electronic marketing, protection of\nminors, data protection, and privacy, communications, content suitability, distribution, competition, taxation, intellectual property, machine\nlearning and AI, money transmission, money laundering, investment screening, export, national security, and climate change, which are\ncontinuously evolving and developing and any such policy and regulatory changes could impose operational and compliance burdens. The\nscope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and evolving and may be conflicting, particularly laws\noutside the United States. There is a risk that existing or future laws may be interpreted in a manner that is not consistent with our current\npractices and which could adversely affect our business. As our Software Platform grows and evolves, including through the use of and\nintegration of AI technologies, and our Software Platform and our Apps are used in a greater number of countries and on a larger scale, we may\nalso become subject to new laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions or jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their\nlaws and regulations. The regulation of AI technologies is a relatively new and evolving area of law which we may become subject to as we\ncontinue to explore the use of AI technologies in our current and future products. For example, in the EU, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act\nimposes a regulatory framework for the companies' development and use of AI systems, and numerous state laws have been proposed, and in\ncertain cases enacted, regulating aspects of the development and use of AI systems. Beyond the EU and U.S., many other countries have\nproposed AI-related legal frameworks. There is a risk that existing or future laws may be interpreted in a manner that is not consistent with our\ncurrent practices and which could adversely affect our business.\nWith respect to our Apps, we are potentially subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect the offering of\ncertain types of content, such as content that depicts violence, the social casino game genre, or loot boxes, many of which are ambiguous or still\nevolving and could be interpreted in ways that could adversely affect our business or expose us to liability. Some state attorneys general as well\nas other international regulatory bodies have brought and may continue to bring legal actions against social casino app developers and the third-\nparty distribution platforms for such apps. Further, several jurisdictions have been regulating and continue\n57\nTable of contents\nto regulate the use of loot boxes in mobile games. Loot boxes are a commonly used monetization technique in free-to-play mobile games in\nwhich a user can acquire a virtual loot box, typically through mobile game play or by using virtual goods, but the user does not know which virtual\ngood(s) he or she will receive (which may be a common, rare, or extremely rare item, and may be a duplicate of an item the user already has in\nhis or her inventory) until the loot box is opened. The user will always receive one or more virtual goods when he or she opens the loot box, but\nthe user does not know exactly which item(s) until the loot box is opened. In April 2018, each of the Belgian Gaming Commission and the Dutch\nGambling Authority declared that loot boxes as implemented in certain games by other companies that they reviewed constituted illegal gambling\nunder each country’s laws. Further, the Federal Trade Commission (the \"FTC\") has examined consumer protection issues related to loot boxes\nand various other jurisdictions, including certain U.S. states, Australia, Brazil, and the United Kingdom are reviewing or have indicated that they\nintend to review the legality of loot boxes and whether they constitute gambling. Additionally, in 2021, Germany approved a new Youth Protection\nAct, that came into effect on May 1, 2021, which makes it unlawful to sell video games that contain loot boxes to minors. In some of our mobile\ngames, certain mechanics may be deemed as “loot boxes”. New regulation by the FTC, U.S. states, or other international jurisdictions could\nrequire that these game mechanics be modified or removed from games or that such apps be changed entirely, both of which could increase the\ncosts of operating our mobile games, impact user engagement and monetization, or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, the\nincreased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact\nthe growth of our business. It is difficult to predict how existing or new laws may be applied to these or similar game mechanics or genres.\nFurther, laws or regulations may vary significantly across jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer\nprotection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through the internet and mobile devices.\nFor example, China implemented a new policy in September 2021 that restricts online gaming for those under age 18 to one hour in the evening\non Fridays, weekends and public holidays. We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase and we will be required to\ndevote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation. For example, existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of IAPs,\nlabeling of free-to-play mobile games, or regulation of currency, banking institutions, unclaimed property or money transmission may be\ninterpreted to cover our mobile games and the virtual currency, goods, or payments that we receive. We may also expand into new business\nopportunities that subject us to additional laws and regulations. As such, we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations, or approvals from\nrelevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to\nadditional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or the\nimposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of the advertising\necosystem. Any costs incurred as a result of adapting to laws and regulations, or as a result of liability in connection therewith, could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, reputation and results of operations.\nThe development and use of AI in our business, combined with an uncertain regulatory environment, may adversely affect our\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe use AI technologies in connection with the development of our Software Platform, including our latest AI-powered advertising engine,\nAXON, and other product offerings, as well as in other aspects of our business, and we will continue to invest in the expansion of our AI\ncapabilities, including possibly generative AI. These technologies are complex and rapidly evolving. The introduction of AI technologies into new\nor existing products or other offerings may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, confidentiality, privacy, data\nprotection, or security risks, ethical concerns, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or\nresults of operations. The impact of AI technology on intellectual property ownership and licensing rights, including copyright, has not been fully\naddressed by U.S. courts or other federal or state laws or regulations, and the use of third-party AI technologies in connection with our products\nand services may result in exposure to claims of copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation. AI technologies, including\ngenerative AI, may create content that is, or is perceived to be, deficient, inaccurate, biased, offensive, unethical, or otherwise flawed. Our\ncustomers or others may rely on or use this content to their detriment, which may expose us to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm,\nand/or legal liability.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and non-compliance with such\nlaws could subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"), the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S.\nTravel Act, and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws applicable in the\n58\nTable of contents\njurisdictions in which we conduct business. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years, are\ninterpreted broadly and prohibit companies, their employees, and third party business partners, representatives, and agents from promising,\nauthorizing, making or offering improper payments or other benefits, directly or indirectly, to government officials and others in the private sector\nin order to influence official action, direct business to any person, gain any improper advantage, or obtain or retain business. As we continue to\nexpand our business internationally, our risks under these laws increase.\nWe and our employees, third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or indirect interactions with officials\nand employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of\nour employees, third-party business partners, representatives, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. These laws also\nrequire that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such\nactions. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees, third-party\nbusiness partners, representatives, and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately\nheld responsible and our exposure for violating these laws increases as our international presence expands and as we increase sales and\noperations in foreign jurisdictions.\nAny allegations or violations of the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media\ncoverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, suspension or disbarment from U.S. government contracts,\nsubstantial diversion of management’s attention, significant legal fees and fines, severe criminal or civil sanctions against us, our officers, or our\nemployees, disgorgement of profits, other sanctions and remedial measures, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, any of which could\nadversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Responding to any investigation or action will likely result\nin a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nWe are subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in global\nmarkets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.\nOur Software Platform and Apps may be subject to U.S. export controls, including the Export Administration Regulations. Under these\nregulations, exports of our products and services as well as the underlying technology may require export authorizations, including by license, a\nlicense exception, or other appropriate government authorizations, and the filing of a classification request or self-classification report to use a\nlicense exception, as applicable.\nFurthermore, our activities are subject to U.S. economic sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control that prohibit the provision of services and the export of hardware, software, and technology to embargoed\njurisdictions or sanctioned parties without the required export authorizations. These laws, regulations, and sanctions are rapidly evolving and\nmay be in conflict across international jurisdictions, leading to uncertainty and difficulty in achieving full compliance. Should we violate such\nexisting or similar future sanctions or regulations, we may be subject to substantial monetary fines or suffer reputational damage and other\npenalties that could negatively impact our business. If we need to obtain any necessary export licenses or other authorizations for a particular\nsale, the process may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of opportunities to sell our products.\nWe take precautions to prevent our products and services and the underlying technology from being provided, deployed or used in\nviolation of export control and sanctions laws, including implementation of IP address blocking and sanctioned person screening, and continue to\nevaluate and further enhance our policies and procedures relating to export control and sanctions compliance. However, we cannot assure you\nthat our policies and procedures relating to export control and sanctions compliance will prevent violations in the future by us or our partners or\nagents. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control regulations, including failure to obtain appropriate import,\nexport, or re-export licenses or permits, it can result in significant penalties and government investigations, as well as reputational harm and loss\nof business. Knowing and willful violations can result in possible incarcerations for responsible employees and managers.\nIn addition to the United States, various other countries regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology,\nincluding import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our\nclients’ ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our Software Platform or Apps, or future changes in export and import\nregulations may create delays in the introduction of our products and the underlying technology in international markets, prevent our clients with\nglobal operations from deploying our products globally, or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries,\ngovernments, or persons altogether.\n59\nTable of contents\nOur growth strategy includes further expanding our operations and client and user base in international markets and acquiring companies\nthat may operate in countries where we do not already do business. Such acquisitions may subject us to additional or expanded export\nregulations. Further, any change in export or import regulations or controls, economic sanctions or related legislation, or change in the countries,\ngovernments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability\nto export or sell our products to, existing or potential clients with global operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability\nto export or sell our products in major international markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our effective tax rates, business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax\nrulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could cause us to be subject to additional income-based taxes and non-\nincome taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, digital services, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes), which in turn could\nadversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, in December 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the tax\nreform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Tax Act\"). The 2017 Tax Act significantly changed the existing U.S. corporate\nincome tax laws by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate, implementing a partially territorial tax system, and imposing a one-\ntime deemed repatriation tax on certain post-1986 foreign earnings. Further, beginning in 2022, the 2017 Tax Act requires U.S. research and\nexperimental expenditures to be capitalized and amortized ratably over a five-year period. Any such expenditures attributable to research\nconducted outside the U.S. must be capitalized and amortized over a 15-year period. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \"IRA\"), enacted on\nAugust 16, 2022, imposed a one-percent non-deductible excise tax on repurchases of stock that are made by U.S. publicly traded corporations\non or after January 1, 2023, which may affect our share repurchase program. The IRA also imposes a 15% minimum tax on global adjusted\nfinancial statement income for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022 for certain large companies. Finally, many countries in the European\nUnion, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, have\nproposed or enacted changes to existing tax laws or new laws that could impact our tax obligations. For example, the Council of the European\nUnion has adopted the proposed 15% global minimum tax, which has been implemented into the domestic laws of some jurisdictions, effective\nfor fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023. Some of these or other new rules could result in double taxation of our international\nearnings. Any significant changes to our future effective tax rate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner\nin which we develop, value, manage, and use our intellectual property and the valuation of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws\napplicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions\nare aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue. Our existing corporate structure and\nintercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner we believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws. However, the\ntaxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany\narrangements, which could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, changes to our corporate structure and intercompany agreements, including through acquisitions, could impact our worldwide\neffective tax rate and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to federal, state, and local taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for (benefit from) taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are\nmany activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be\nadversely affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, principles, and interpretations, including those relating\nto income tax nexus, by our earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than\nanticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, and by challenges to our intercompany relationships and transfer pricing\narrangements. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific\njurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest,\nand penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our\nbusiness, with some changes possibly affecting our tax obligations in future or past years.\n60\nTable of contents\nWe believe that our financial statements reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency, but there can be no assurances in that regard.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or\nsimilar taxes, and any such assessments could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe collect sales tax and value added taxes in a number of jurisdictions. Sales and use, value added, and similar tax laws and rates vary\ngreatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable or that our presence\nin such jurisdictions is sufficient to require us to collect taxes, which could result in tax assessments, penalties, and interest, and we may be\nrequired to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties, and interest or future requirements may adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Further, in June 2018, the Supreme Court held in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. that states could\nimpose sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers even if those sellers lack any physical presence within the states imposing the\nsales taxes. Under the Wayfair decision, a person requires only a “substantial nexus” with the taxing state before the state may subject the\nperson to sales tax collection obligations therein. An increasing number of states (both before and after the publication of the Wayfair decision)\nhave considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers. The Supreme\nCourt’s Wayfair decision has removed a significant impediment to the enactment and enforcement of these laws, and it is possible that states\nmay seek to tax out-of-state sellers on sales that occurred in prior tax years, which could create additional administrative burdens for us, put us\nat a competitive disadvantage if such states do not impose similar obligations on our competitors, and decrease our future sales, which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to realize tax savings from our international structure, which could materially and adversely affect our results of\noperations.\nIn 2023, we completed an international restructuring that included the inter-entity license of certain intellectual property and other assets\nused in the business to our Singapore subsidiary. This structure may be challenged by tax authorities, and if such challenges are successful, the\ntax savings we expect to realize could be adversely affected. If substantial modifications to our international structure or the way we operate our\nbusiness are made, such as if future acquisitions or divestitures occur, if changes in domestic and international tax laws negatively impact the\nstructure (such as the proposed 15% global minimum tax, which has been implemented into the domestic laws of some jurisdictions), if we do\nnot operate our business consistent with the structure and applicable tax provisions , if we fail to achieve our revenue and profit goals, or if the\ninternational structure or our application of arm’s-length principles to intercompany arrangements is successfully challenged by the U.S. or\nforeign tax authorities, our effective tax rate may increase, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nIf we are found liable for content that is distributed through or advertising that is served through our Software Platform or Apps, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nAs a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement, public performance\nroyalties, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we distribute. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the \"DMCA\") is\nintended, in part, to limit the liability of eligible service providers for caching, hosting, or linking to user content that includes materials that\ninfringe copyrights or other rights. We rely on the protections provided by the DMCA in conducting our business. Similarly, Section 230 of the\nCommunications Decency Act (\"Section 230\") protects online distribution platforms, such as ours, from actions taken under various laws that\nmight otherwise impose liability on the platform provider for what content creators develop or the actions they take or inspire.\nHowever, the DMCA, Section 230, and similar statutes and doctrines that we may rely on in the future are subject to uncertain judicial\ninterpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. Future regulatory or legislative changes may ultimately require us to take a more\nactive approach towards content moderation, which could diminish the depth, breadth, and variety of content we offer and, in so doing, reduce\nour revenue. Moreover, the DMCA and Section 230 provide protections primarily in the United States. If the rules around these statutes and\ndoctrines change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply similar protections, or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules\nto our business, we could incur liability and our business could be adversely affected. If we become liable for these types of claims as a result of\nthe content that is included in our Apps or the advertisements that are served through our Software Platform, then our business may be\nadversely affected. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could adversely\naffect our business. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability that\n61\nTable of contents\nmay be imposed on us.\nIn addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our liability for the actions of third parties, we may incur significant legal\nexpenses and other costs if copyright holders assert claims, or commence litigation, alleging copyright infringement against our third-party\ndevelopers. While we prohibit mobile apps without distribution rights from the copyright holder, and we maintain processes and systems for the\nreporting and removal of infringing mobile apps, such prohibitions, processes, and systems may not always be successful. If other developers,\nlicensees, platform providers, business partners, and personnel are influenced by the existence of types of claims or proceedings and are\ndeterred from working with us as a consequence, our ability to maintain or expand our business, including through international expansion plans,\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws\nand regulations affecting public companies, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), and the rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq listing standards.\nThe Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and results of\noperations. Compliance with these requirements has increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance\ncosts and increase demand on our systems, making some activities more time-consuming and costly. We expect these rules and regulations to\nmake it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and\nretain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers. As a public company, we have incurred and expect to\nincur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, as a public company, we may be subject to shareholder activism, which can lead to\nsubstantial costs, distract management, and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in our public filings with the SEC as required of a public company, our business and financial\ncondition will become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties.\nIf such claims are successful, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do\nnot result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the\nresources of our management and our board of directors and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLegal or regulatory proceedings and settlements could cause us to incur additional expenses or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are involved in or may become involved in claims, suits, government investigations, including formal and informal inquiries from\ngovernment authorities and regulators, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to\nintellectual property claims, securities claims, privacy, data protection, or law enforcement matters, tax matters, labor and employment claims,\ncommercial and acquisition-related claims, and other matters. We may become the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests\nfor information, actions, and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law\nenforcement, consumer protection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. In addition, we are currently, and may in\nthe future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example, data protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities in\nthe European Union have initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use\ninformation, or impose sanctions, and other authorities may do the same.\nAny such claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with\ncertainty. Regardless of their outcomes, such legal or regulatory proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs,\ndiversion of management and other personnel attention, and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such\nproceedings could result in substantial costs, civil and criminal liability, penalties, or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees, or orders\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products or services, or requiring a change in our business practices, products or\ntechnologies, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n62\nTable of contents\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nFailure to protect or enforce our proprietary and intellectual property rights or the costs involved in such enforcement could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe regard our Software Platform and Apps and related source code as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a\ncombination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws and employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, to protect our\nproprietary rights. We view the protection of our trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, domain names, patents, and\nother product rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law\nrights, as well as contractual restrictions and business practices. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with\nour employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and\ndisclosure and use of, our proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and business practices may not prevent the\nmisappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others.\nWe own or license, and pursue the registration of, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, and patents in the United States\nand in certain locations outside the United States. This process can be expensive and time-consuming, may not always be successful depending\non local laws or other circumstances, and we also may choose not to pursue registrations in every location depending on the nature of the\nproject to which the intellectual property rights pertain. We may, over time, increase our investments in protecting our creative works.\nWe are aware that some unauthorized copying of our Apps occurs, and if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our\nApps were to occur, it could adversely affect our business. In addition, even if authorized copying of our Apps occurs, third-party platforms may\nnot remove infringing material. We also cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our products\nin connection with emerging technologies. For example, laws relating to intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright,\nwith respect to AI and the use of tools containing AI have not been fully interpreted by U.S. courts or been fully addressed by federal and state\nregulations. As a result, our ability to fully protect our products, technologies and solutions under current and future legal regimes, especially as it\nrelates to AI tools and technologies, may be limited or impacted by future laws, regulations, interpretations or other legislative or judicial actions.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of\nproprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse\npublicity, and diversion of management and technical resources. If we fail to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property rights, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could require us to pay\nsignificant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nFrom time to time, we have faced, and we may face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents,\nand other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our competitors, non-practicing entities and former employers of our\npersonnel. Intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict. As the result of any court\njudgment or settlement, we may be obligated to alter our Software Platform or Apps, in a particular geographic region or worldwide, pay royalties\nor significant settlement costs, purchase licenses, or develop substitutes.\nIn certain of our agreements, we also indemnify our licensees and other business partners. We may incur significant expenses defending\nthese business partners if they are sued for intellectual property infringement based on allegations related to our technology. If a business\npartner were to lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be subject to significant monetary liabilities. In addition,\nbecause our Software Platform and Apps often involve the use of third-party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in\ncircumstances where there is a claim of infringement asserted against one of our mobile games or other products and services in question, even\nif the claim does not pertain to our technology.\nMany of our products and services contain open source software, and we license some of our software through open source projects,\nwhich may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, products, and services in a manner that could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe use open source software in our Software Platform and Apps and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. In\naddition, we contribute software source code to open source projects under open source\n63\nTable of contents\nlicenses or release internal software projects under open source licenses, and anticipate continuing to do so in the future. The terms of many\nopen source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software\nlicenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our products\nor services. Additionally, under some open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain\nmanner, third parties may claim ownership of, a license to, or demand release of, the open source software or derivative works that we\ndeveloped using such software, which could include our proprietary source code. Such third parties may also seek to enforce the terms of the\napplicable open source license through litigation which, if successful, could require us to make our proprietary software source code freely\navailable, purchase a costly license, or cease offering the implicated products or services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid\ninfringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to\ncomplete it successfully. In addition to risks related to open source license requirements, use of certain open source software may pose greater\nrisks than use of third-party commercial software, since open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of\nsoftware and open source software could incorporate AI generated code which may be a result of hallucinatory behavior. Any of these risks could\nbe difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nOur ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property may affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. Competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs.\nWhile most of the intellectual property we use in our Software Platform and Apps is created by us, from time to time, we also acquire rights\nto third-party intellectual property. Proprietary licenses may limit our use of intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods,\nrequire time and attention of licensors in providing guidance and related approvals, and include other contractual obligations with which we must\ncomply. Additionally, competition for these licenses is intense and often results in increased advances, minimum payment guarantees, and\nroyalties to the licensor, and as such we may be unable to identify suitable licensing targets or complete licensing arrangements. If we are\nunable to obtain and remain in compliance with the terms of these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms, our\nbusiness and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, if the mix of IAPs shifts toward mobile games in which we use licensed\nintellectual property or if we develop additional Apps that require licensing of third-party intellectual property, our overall margins may be reduced\ndue to royalty obligations.\nIn addition, many of our Apps are built on proprietary source code of third parties, such as Unity Software. Unity Software offers certain\nsolutions that may compete with our offerings. If we are unable to renew licenses to proprietary source code underlying our mobile games, or the\nterms and conditions of these licenses change at the time of renewal, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected. We rely on third parties, including Unity Software, to maintain versions of their proprietary engines that allow us to distribute\nour mobile games on multiple platforms. If a third party from whom we license source code discontinues support for one or more of these\nplatforms, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Financial and Accounting Matters\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce\ntimely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and\nregulations of the applicable Nasdaq listing standards. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase\nour legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place significant strain\non our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within\nthe time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is\naccumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal\n64\nTable of contents\ncontrol over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-\nrelated costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls and systems do not perform as expected, we may\nexperience deficiencies in our controls. The effectiveness of our controls and procedures may also be limited by a variety of factors including\nfaulty human judgment and simple errors, omissions or mistakes, fraudulent action of an individual or collusion of two or more people, and\ninappropriate management override of controls and procedures.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business.\nFurther, to the extent we acquire other businesses, the acquired company may not have a sufficiently robust system of controls and we may\ndiscover deficiencies. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement\ncould adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our\nfinancial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely\naffect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that are filed with the SEC.\nIneffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our\nreported financial and other information, which would likely cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. In addition, if we are\nunable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. As a public company,\nwe are required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent\nregistered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent\nregistered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over\nfinancial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial\nreporting could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and could cause the market price of our Class A\ncommon stock to decline.\nWe rely on assumptions and estimates to calculate certain of our key metrics and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics could\nadversely affect our reputation and our business.\nCertain of the metrics that we disclose are calculated using internal company data that has not been independently verified or data from\nthird-party attribution partners. While these metrics and figures are based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable\nperiod of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring these metrics and figures across our worldwide client base and user base.\nWe regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our metrics and other figures to improve their accuracy, but these efforts may\nnot prove successful and we may discover material inaccuracies. In addition, our methodology for calculating these metrics may be updated\nfrom time to time and may differ from the methodology used by other companies to calculate similar metrics and figures. We may also discover\nunexpected errors in the data that we are using that resulted from technical or other errors. If we determine that any of our metrics or figures are\nnot accurate, we may be required to revise or cease reporting such metrics or figures. Any real or perceived inaccuracies in our metrics and\nother figures could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill becomes impaired.\nWe are required under GAAP to review our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating a\nrequirement to reevaluate whether our goodwill continues to be recoverable, include a significant decline in the market price of our Class A\ncommon stock and our market capitalization, slower growth rates in our industry, underperformance of certain assets, or other materially adverse\nevents. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of\nour goodwill is determined.\nWe have substantial indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities and our obligations thereunder may limit our operational\nflexibility or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are party to a credit agreement that provides for senior secured credit consisting of term loans and a revolving credit facility, with\nvarying maturity dates through 2030. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness under our\ncredit facilities was $3.54 billion. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay this indebtedness when due, or that we will be able to\nrefinance this indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.\n65\nTable of contents\nOur indebtedness could adversely impact us. For example, these obligations could among other things:\n• make it difficult for us to pay other obligations;\n• increase our cost of borrowing;\n• make it difficult to obtain favorable terms for any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic\nacquisitions and partnerships, debt service requirements, or other purposes;\n• restrict us from making strategic acquisitions and partnerships or cause us to make divestitures or similar transactions;\n• adversely affect our liquidity and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition upon repayment of the indebtedness;\n• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service and repay the indebtedness, reducing the\namount of cash flow available for other purposes;\n• increase our vulnerability to adverse and economic conditions;\n• increase our exposure to interest rate risk from variable rate indebtedness;\n• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n• limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business.\nIn addition, from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap instruments to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest\nrates. While our hedging strategy is designed to minimize the impact of increases in interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt, including\nour credit facility, there can be no guarantee that our hedging strategy will be effective, and we may experience credit-related losses in some\ncircumstances.\nOur credit agreement also imposes restrictions on us and requires us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to\ncomply with these covenants may be affected by market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors, as well as other\nfactors that are beyond our control. A breach of any of the covenants in the credit agreement governing our credit facilities could result in an\nevent of default, which, if not cured or waived, could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness and an increase in the interest rates applicable to\nsuch indebtedness, and may result in the acceleration of or default under any other debt we may incur in the future to which a cross-acceleration\nor cross-default provision applies. In addition, we have granted a security interest in a significant portion of our assets to secure our obligations\nunder our credit facility. During the existence of an event of default under our credit agreement, the applicable lenders could exercise their rights\nand remedies thereunder, including by way of initiating foreclosure proceedings against any assets constituting collateral for our obligations\nunder the credit facility. The acceleration of the indebtedness under our credit agreement or under any other indebtedness could have a material\nand adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and results of\noperations, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory, and\nother factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the\nprincipal, premium, if any, or interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service\nobligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay strategic acquisitions and partnerships, capital expenditures, and payments on account of other\nobligations, seek additional capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, or sell assets. These alternative measures may not be successful\nand may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the\ncondition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could\nrequire us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that\nwe will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf we are unable to repay or otherwise refinance our indebtedness when due, or if any other event of default is not cured or waived, the\napplicable lenders could accelerate our outstanding obligations or proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness,\nwhich could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the\n66\nTable of contents\nevent the applicable lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that\nindebtedness. Any acceleration of amounts due under the agreements governing our credit facility or the exercise by the applicable lenders of\ntheir rights under the security documents could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and support business growth, and this capital may not be available\non acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to\nbusiness challenges, including the need to continue to develop our Software Platform, enhance our existing Apps and develop new Apps and\nfeatures, improve our operating infrastructure, or enter into new markets or strategic acquisitions and partnerships. Accordingly, we may need to\nengage in equity, equity-linked, or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or\nconvertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have\nrights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing that we secure in the future\ncould involve offering additional security interests and undertaking restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial\nand operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including\npotential acquisitions. Our credit agreement, which provides for a term loan and revolving credit facility, contains financial covenants with which\nwe must comply. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. Additionally, if we seek to access additional\ncapital or increase our borrowing, there can be no assurance that financing and credit may be available on favorable terms, if at all. If we are\nunable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business\ngrowth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business, financial condition, or results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock and Governance\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement among the Voting Agreement Parties have the effect of\nconcentrating voting power with the Voting Agreement Parties, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our\ncertificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or\nother major corporate transactions.\nWe have three classes of common stock. Our Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per\nshare, and our Class C common stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Adam Foroughi, our co-founder, CEO, and\nChairperson; Herald Chen, our former President and Chief Financial Officer, and a member of our board of directors; and KKR Denali Holdings\nL.P. (collectively with certain affiliates, the \"Voting Agreement Parties\") together hold all of the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B\ncommon stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Voting Agreement Parties collectively held approximately 73% of the voting power of our\noutstanding capital stock in the aggregate. This voting power includes shares of Class A common stock deemed beneficially owned in\naccordance with Rule 13d-3(d)(1) under the Exchange Act. The Voting Agreement Parties have entered into a voting agreement (the \"Voting\nAgreement\") whereby all Class B common stock held by the Voting Agreement Parties and their respective permitted entities and permitted\ntransferees will be voted as determined by two of Mr. Foroughi, Mr. Chen, and KKR Denali Holdings L.P. (one of which must be Mr. Foroughi). As\na result, the Voting Agreement Parties will collectively be able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our\nstockholders, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the\napproval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. The Voting Agreement\nParties may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree, and which may be adverse to your interests.\nThis concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our\nstockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically converting into shares of\nClass A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning, transfers among affiliates, of KKR\nDenali Holdings L.P., or other transfers among the Voting Agreement Parties. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert\nautomatically into one share of Class A common stock upon certain events specified in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\n67\nTable of contents\nIn addition, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue Class C\ncommon stock in the future, the holders of Class B common stock may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most\nmatters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than\nClass C common stock in such transactions.\nWe are considered a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, and, as a result, we\nqualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement among the Voting Agreement Parties, the Voting\nAgreement Parties collectively hold greater than a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and the Voting Agreement Parties\nhave the authority to vote the shares of all Class B common stock, subject to the terms of the Voting Agreement, at their discretion on all matters\nto be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as that term is set forth in the Nasdaq corporate\ngovernance requirements. Under these corporate governance requirements, a company in which over 50% of the voting power for the election of\ndirectors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate\ngovernance requirements, including:\n• the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\n• the requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is comprised entirely of independent directors with\na written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities;\n• the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter\naddressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and\n• the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nWe do not currently avail ourselves of any of these corporate governance accommodations, though we may do so in the future. In the\nevent that we cease to be a “controlled company” and our Class A common stock continues to be listed on Nasdaq, we will be required to\ncomply with these provisions within the applicable transition periods.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has, and may continue to, fluctuate substantially depending on a number of factors,\nincluding those described in this “Risk Factors” section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating\nperformance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause\nfluctuations in the market price of our Class A common stock include the following:\n• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time, including fluctuations due to general economic\nuncertainty or negative market sentiment;\n• volatility in the market and trading volumes of technology stocks;\n• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in\nparticular;\n• sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;\n• rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n• failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our\ncompany, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n• actual or perceived significant data breaches involving our Software Platform or Apps;\n• the financial or non-financial metric projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\n• third-party data published about us or other mobile gaming companies, whether or not such data accurately reflects actual levels of\nusage;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services;\n68\nTable of contents\n• the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n• fluctuations in the trading volume of shares of our Class A common stock or the size of our public float;\n• short selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative securities;\n• actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n• actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;\n• our issuance or repurchase of shares of our Class A common stock;\n• litigation or regulatory action involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our\ncompetitors;\n• developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n• announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n• new laws, regulations or app store policies or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or app store policies applicable to our\nbusiness;\n• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n• major catastrophic events in our domestic and foreign markets;\n• any significant change in our management; and\n• general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the market price of\nour Class A common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The market price of\nour Class A common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly\naffect us. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the liquidity of any trading market, your ability to sell your shares of our Class A common stock\nwhen desired, or the prices that you may obtain for your shares of our Class A common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been\nbrought against that company. If the market price of our Class A common stock is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation.\nSecurities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business. Such litigation\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our share repurchase programs and any failure to repurchase our\nClass A common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock price.\nAs of September 30, 2024, $270.7 million of Class A common stock was available for repurchase under our share repurchase program. In\nOctober 2024, our board of directors authorized an increase to our share repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion, which additional amount may\nbe repurchased from time to time subject to a limitation in any fiscal quarter of the amount of our Free Cash Flow in the preceding fiscal quarter\nand compliance with applicable law and any contractual restrictions under our Credit Agreement or future agreements. Under this or any other\nfuture share repurchase programs, we may make share repurchases through a variety of methods, including open share market purchases,\nblock transactions or privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Our share repurchase program has\nno time limit, does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion and without\nprior notice. The timing and amount of any repurchases, if any, will be subject to liquidity, stock price, market and economic conditions,\ncompliance with applicable legal requirements such as Delaware surplus and solvency tests, compliance with our credit agreement, and other\nrelevant factors. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and\ninvestor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price.\nThe existence of this share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would be and could potentially\nreduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although this program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance it will\ndo so because the market price of our Class A\n69\nTable of contents\ncommon stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the\neffectiveness of the program.\nRepurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital, capital expenditures,\nstrategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate requirements, and we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term\nstockholder value of any share repurchase programs.\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock could depress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock\nin the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nCertain stockholders are entitled, under our investors' rights agreement, to certain demand registration rights. In addition, we filed a\nregistration statement to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans and a registration statement to\nregister shares of Class A common stock issued pursuant to our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan for resale. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of\napplicable exercise periods, the registered shares, including those issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options, will be available for\nimmediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our Class A common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity\nsecurities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales also could cause the market price of our Class A common\nstock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nThe issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans, or otherwise will\ndilute all other stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1,500,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, up to\n150,000,000 shares of Class C common stock, and up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be\ndetermined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue shares of Class A common\nstock or securities convertible into shares of our Class A common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment,\nour equity incentive plans, or otherwise. For example, in connection with our acquisition of Adjust in April 2021, we issued convertible securities\nthat converted into an aggregate of 6,320,688 shares of our Class A common stock. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our\nexisting stockholders and cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nOur multi-class stock structure, the Voting Agreement, and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\nand amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of\nour Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition\nof our company more difficult, including the following:\n• our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide the Voting Agreement Parties with the ability to\ndetermine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a\nmajority of the shares of our outstanding common stock;\n• vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\n• a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by a majority of our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of\ndirectors, our Chief Executive Officer, or our President;\n• advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an\nannual meeting of stockholders;\n• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\n• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be\nestablished and shares of which may be issued by our board of directors, without further action by our stockholders;\n• after the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a\n70\nTable of contents\nmajority of the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the \"Voting Threshold\nDate\"), our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and will not be able to take action by written\nconsent for any matter; and\n• certain litigation against us may only be brought in Delaware.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These\nprovisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to\ntake other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a\npremium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware and the federal district courts\nof the United States as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our\nstockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent\npermitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim\nof breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant\nto any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated\nbylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of\nDelaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the\ncourt having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants, and provided that this exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits\nbrought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act.\nSection 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly,\nboth state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat\nof inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the\nfederal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising\nunder the Securities Act. However, while the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to\nrequire claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are “facially valid” under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other\ncourts will enforce our federal forum provision. If the federal forum provision is found to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs\nassociated with resolving such matters.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding or owning (or continuing to hold or own) any interest in any of our\nsecurities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing bylaw provisions. Although we believe these exclusive forum\nprovisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws in the types of lawsuits to\nwhich each applies, the exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes\nwith us or any of our directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims against us\nand our current and former directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our\ncompliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum provisions. Further, in the\nevent a court finds either exclusive forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an\naction, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nSales of Unregistered Securities\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 43,665 shares of our Class A common stock upon the vesting and\nsettlement of RSUs issued under our 2021 Partner Studio Incentive Plan.\nThe foregoing transactions did not involve any underwriters, any underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering. We believe\nthe offer, sale, and issuance of the above securities was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) by\nvirtue of Section 4(a)(2) of the Act and Regulation S promulgated under the Act, because the issuance of securities to the recipients did not\ninvolve a public offering. The\n71\nTable of contents\nrecipients of the securities in the transaction represented their intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for\nsale in connection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificates issued in the transaction. All\nrecipients had adequate access, through their relationships with us or otherwise, to information about us. The issuance of these securities was\nmade without any general solicitation or advertising.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nThe following table summarizes the share repurchase activity for the three months ended September 30, 2024:\nApproximate Dollar Value of\nTotal Number of Shares\nShares that May Yet Be\nTotal Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly\nAverage Price Paid Per Share Purchased Under the Program\nPeriod Purchased (1) (2) Announced Programs (1) (1)\n(in thousands) (in thousands) (in millions)\nJuly 1 - 31 — $ — — $ 500\nAugust 1 - 31 1,160 $ 86.48 1,160 $ 400\nSeptember 1 - 30 1,455 $ 88.49 1,455 $ 271\nTotal 2,615 2,615\n(1) In February 2022, our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to $750.0 million of our Class A common stock. In May 2023, our board of\ndirectors authorized an increase to the repurchase program of $296.0 million. In August 2023, our board of directors authorized an additional increase to the\nrepurchase program of $447.6 million. In February 2024, our board of directors authorized an increase to the repurchase program of $1.25 billion. In October\n2024, our board of directors authorized an increase to our share repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion, which additional amount may be repurchased from\ntime to time subject to a limitation in any fiscal quarter of the amount of our Free Cash Flow in the preceding fiscal quarter and compliance with applicable law\nand any contractual restrictions under our Credit Agreement or future agreements.Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases\nor through privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Open market repurchases\nmay be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b-5 trading plans to facilitate\nrepurchases of shares. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our Class A common stock, has no expiration date and\nmay be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time at our discretion. See Note 6 - Equity of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in\nPart I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to share repurchases.\n(2) Average price paid per share includes commissions and fees associated with the repurchases under our repurchase program.\nITEM 5.

Diversification \n\n[](#cta-form)\n\n##  Introduction \n\nConsumer habits are trending toward mobile, and apps have become a part of our everyday lives—it’s where we shop, bank, unwind, and more. As such, mobile advertising has become one of the most effective ways for brands to diversify their marketing channel mix to reach consumers. Mobile in-app advertising offers an advantage to access these untapped audiences and discover new growth for consumer businesses. \n\nA growing number of brands are finding success by diversifying their strategy to include in-app advertising. This allows them to reach consumers in areas where competition is less intense compared to channels like social. \n\nAppLovin, the leading marketing platform for business growth, developed this report to show why there has never been a more crucial time for consumer mobile and direct-to-consumer brands to meet audiences where they are—in their mobile apps. We’ll also share the framework for starting and scaling in-app advertising within a brand’s marketing mix.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\nShifts in consumer behavior impact mobile spending.\n\nAs reliance on mobile devices increases, consumer spending has reached unprecedented levels. Brands need to make sure they’re meeting their customers where they are.\n\nMarketing channel diversification helps consumer brands stand out from the crowd.\n\nUsers spend 25% of their time in apps, giving marketers a competitive edge in engaging them. Mobile connects brands with customers more effectively, ensuring ads aren’t lost in the clutter.\n\nMobile in-app advertising delivers untapped scale.\n\nConsumer brands can reach over 5 billion global smartphone users every day; that’s scale rivaling any other marketing channel. \n\nBrand safety is a built-in function of mobile advertising.\n\nApp stores thoroughly review the apps on their platforms while many in-app ad formats have 100% share-of-voice, which minimizes the risk of appearing alongside unsafe content.\n\nIncorporating mobile into a multi-channel strategy is simple and delivers measurable results.\n\nAdvanced campaigns target consumer behaviors across apps to optimize toward business goals. AI automates this process with precision to deliver the right message at the right time to the right customer. \n\n##  Consumer Behavior Shifts Fuel Mobile Spending \n\nIt’s no secret that consumer behaviors are becoming more mobile-centric. [Nearly 50% of online transactions](https://expertbeacon.com/mobile-marketing-statistics/#:~:text=47%25%20ECommerce%20Transactions%20Now%20Mobile) occurred on mobile devices this year and will grow to 62% by the end of 2025, highlighting consumers’ preference for mobile shopping. Global m-commerce sales are projected to top [$2.52 trillion in 2024](https://www.statista.com/chart/13139/estimated-worldwide-mobile-e-commerce-sales/), up 16% from last year.\n\n![](https://www.applovin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Graph-Consumer-report_GlobalM_x2-1-1024x740.png)\n\nSavvy app marketers and direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands following this trend (and the money) are increasingly opening their marketing channel mix to include mobile and because of that, mobile advertising revenue is growing. U.S. mobile advertising spend, specifically in-app advertising, is expected to grow to over [$200 billion (+15% Y/Y)](https://www.emarketer.com/content/mobile-advertising-2024) and increase globally to [$400 billion (+11% Y/Y)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/303817/mobile-internet-advertising-revenue-worldwide/) by the end of this year.\n\n![](https://www.applovin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Graph-Consumer-report_InApp_Ad_x2-2-1024x806.png)Apps will reach a dominant 81.9% share of mobile ad spending this year.\n\nConsumers rely on the convenience that mobile brings to their daily lives whether they’re on the move or relaxing at home. These interactions extend beyond search and social media; they happen within mobile apps.\n\n##  The Strategic Need for Marketing Channel Diversification \n\nToday, consuming goods and services on mobile is much more commonplace, so a mobile user acquisition strategy is key and delivers a competitive advantage for growing any consumer business.\n\n[According to Sensor Tower](https://sensortower.com/q2-2024-digital-market-index?), global mobile app downloads will hit 181 billion with consumer spending forecasted to reach $233 billion in 2026. This audience is also highly connected to their apps, spending an average of [four hours](https://www.emarketer.com/content/digital-media-makes-up-nearly-two-thirds-of-consumers-total-time-spent-with-media) within them. Comparatively, users are spending about [2.5 hours per day](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2024-deep-dive-the-time-we-spend-on-social-media) using social platforms. By diversifying beyond social, marketers can create more touchpoints by placing offerings in front of consumers across the various apps they use daily – reaching them beyond their social media scrolling. \n\nWhile social media continues to be an important way to reach new users, it is highly competitive and often oversaturated with ads, accounting for a [disproportionate amount of ad dollars](https://www.emarketer.com/content/meta-s-ad-revenue-share-vastly-exceeds-its-share-of-consumer-time) relative to consumer engagement. Connecting with users outside of this marketing channel maximizes scale, improves efficiency, and minimizes risk.\n\nMarketers can no longer ignore the opportunity that mobile apps present to reach their ideal customers at the times and frequencies that increase their likelihood of engagement.\n\n##  Mobile In-App Advertising Delivers Significant Scale \n\nToday, over [5.6 billion people](https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/connectivity-for-good/mobile-economy/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/260224-The-Mobile-Economy-2024.pdf) have a smartphone with a mobile subscription, representing 69% of the world’s population. These users engage with apps in various ways.\n\n![](https://www.applovin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/illo-consumer-mobile-trends-infographic-1-802x1024.png)\n\nConsumer apps, in particular, are seeing a significant surge in usage and mobile spending.\n\n![fact-img](https://www.applovin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-82.png)\n\nBy 2025, mobile payments will account for 79% of all digital transactions, with the market projected to reach $607.9 billion by 2030. Banking app users are expected to exceed 3.6 billion this year.2\n\n![fact-img](https://www.applovin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-85.png)\n\nGlobal m-commerce sales are projected to hit $2.5 trillion in 2024, representing 60% of total e-commerce sales, with 100 billion hours spent in shopping apps worldwide in 2023.2\n\n![fact-img](https://www.applovin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-84.png)\n\nHealth and fitness apps generated $4.45 billion in 2023, with 75% of that revenue driven from subscriptions and accounted for 18% of the total health and fitness technology market.4\n\nThose acquired through in-app ads tend to be more engaged than those from other marketing channels. In the fintech sector, for instance, in-app ad customers open their apps nine times a month on average, compared to 5.8 times for social media-acquired customers according to Adjust Data1. This increased engagement leads to more repeat transactions, driving higher revenue and allowing marketers to reinvest in user acquisition and enhancing product features. This virtuous cycle improves user experience and retention, creating more revenue opportunities for consumer brands.\n\n[ ](https://try.applovin.com/appdiscovery2024-hd1)\n\nTap into mobile’s massive scale\n\nUnlock your brand’s growth potential with AppLovin’s mobile advertising solutions. \n\n[Try AppDiscovery](https://try.applovin.com/appdiscovery2024-hd1)\n\nEnerjoy, a Singapore-based wellness app studio with 31 million users worldwide, partnered with AppLovin to drive incremental subscriptions with a global, [multi-campaign strategy](https://www.applovin.com/success-stories/enerjoy/). The subscribers acquired generated 23% more revenue per user compared to other marketing channels.\n\nAppDiscovery’s technology is exceptionally effective at finding users who will sign up for subscriptions in our apps. Because the platform’s scale is so vast, we’re finding these users in large numbers.\n\nBetty He\n\nChief Marketing Officer, Enerjoy\n\n##  Mobile is a Safe Space for Consumer Brands \n\nIn-app advertising is a naturally safe environment for consumer brands because of its focus on performance and retention. \n\nApp Stores have strict publishing criteria.\n\nThese guidelines ensure that apps provide a safe and high-quality user experience and help maintain a brand-safe environment for advertisers. \n\nApps rely heavily on ratings and reviews.\n\nApps with a poor ad experience typically receive bad ratings, which can result in app store removal. In contrast, apps with excellent reviews and higher downloads will rank highly. This feedback loop ensures a high standard of quality and brand safety.\n\nHigh-engagement mobile ad formats are 100% SOV.\n\nVideo and playable ads have 100% on-screen share of voice (SOV) — meaning ads don’t appear alongside other content, virtually eliminating brand safety risk.\n\nMobile ads focus on performance metrics like downloads, sales, and user engagement.\n\nThe conversion-focused goals favored by mobile ads naturally exclude low-quality or harmful content.\n\nExperian, a US-based finance company, showcased their services with 30-second full-screen video ads, minimizing the risk of appearing near unsuitable content. As a result, AppLovin quickly became a [top 3 source](https://www.applovin.com/success-stories/experian/) for Experian’s install volume due to its brand-safe, scalable reach across trusted apps.\n\nWe’ve found substantial scale in a short period of time with AppDiscovery and we can rest assured that our ads appear in contexts that align with our brand.\n\nGreg Rossi\n\nDirector of Integrated Marketing, Experian\n\n##  Getting Started with Mobile In-App Advertising \n\nTesting mobile as part of a multi-channel strategy is easy and can drive measurable results. These proven best practices will help.\n\n##### **Run campaigns focused on bottom-of-funnel goals**\n\nIn-app advertising offers diverse ways to engage consumers based on the actions a brand wants them to take. By running advanced campaigns optimized for different goals, users can be acquired with varied, yet complementary, retention and ROAS profiles. This approach not only helps identify the most effective campaigns, but also uncovers new incremental audiences to engage with.\n\n![](https://www.applovin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Graph-Consumer-report-03-1.svg)\n\n##### **Partner with platforms prioritizing advanced AI advertising tech**\n\n![](https://www.applovin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Consumer-report_Section-break-sketch-10-1024x340.png)\n\nWith recent advancements in technology, campaigns can create targets based on consumers’ engagement within different apps. Focusing campaigns on consumer actions rather than specific environments results in efficient and highly scalable campaigns. This approach also allows for continuous testing and refinement of advertising messages and strategies, improving the effectiveness and scalability of campaigns.\n\n![](https://www.applovin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/illo-consumer-mobile-trends-UA-1024x576.jpg)\n\nGerman retailer OTTO leveraged the powerful targeting and learning capabilities of AppLovin’s AppDiscovery to acquire users who increased their average order value, [improving D7 ROAS by 82%](https://www.applovin.com/success-stories/otto/).\n\nWorking with AppLovin has been a low-effort, high-impact avenue to meet our growth objectives. AppDiscovery’s AI-based advertising engine is highly automated, so we don’t need to put significant resources into launching, monitoring, or tweaking our campaigns.\n\nMarian Bucher\n\nApp Growth Expert, OTTO\n\n##### Tailor ad creatives for mobile\n\nWithin mobile apps, ad creative is all about grabbing the consumers’ attention and encouraging engagement. Leverage popular ad formats such as [playables and videos](https://www.applovin.com/blog/infographic-all-about-mobile-ad-formats/) to deepen brand interaction. Broaden audience appeal by making it fun and inspire action by [incorporating gamification into ads](https://try.applovin.com/coffee-creative-webinar-mobile-ad-gamification?_gl=1*1pnzsfv*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3MjQ3MDE5ODYuQ2owS0NRand6N0MyQmhEa0FSSXNBQV9TWktaSFRWX1RhQkJ2UTk4dUhsYlRhQWRTMlJfUnY0OUo0QUlsV2RZSl9TNlpndXdnajRKbkUwSWFBdjlzRUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*ODkwNDkxNDAyLjE3MTc1MTY2OTA.*_ga*MTMwNDg5Njc5NS4xNjYxMTk1Nzk2*_ga_0JQJREV5DQ*MTcyNDk1NDc1Ni42MzUuMS4xNzI0OTU0ODM2LjQwLjAuMA..). Verticals like finance and wellness are using this concept to demonstrate app functionality, such as simulating transactions or fitness tracking before a user installs the app​​.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag. \n\nHighlight the most compelling features of an app or brand by gamifying the experience. \n\nRemember – there is no one-size-fits-all ad when it comes to mobile. Ad creatives that are continually tested and iterated on are the most successful in driving performance.\n\n[ ](https://www.applovin.com/sparklabs/creative-trends/)\n\nCreative Trends Report\n\nGet more tips like these from AppLovin’s in-house creative team, SparkLabs, in their Performance-driven Ad Trends Report. \n\n[Learn More](https://www.applovin.com/sparklabs/creative-trends/)\n\n##  Conclusion \n\nAs customers increasingly rely on their mobile devices, there is a growing opportunity to engage them via in-app advertising.
