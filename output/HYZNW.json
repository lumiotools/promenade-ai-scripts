DIABLO RESOURCE RECOVERY\n\nNovember 14, 2024\n\n_Further Demonstrates Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology as a Sustainable, Zero-Emission Solution for Heavy Duty Applications_\n\nBOLINGBROOK, Ill., Nov. 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Hyzon (NASDAQ: HYZN) (Hyzon or the Company), a U.S.-based, high-performance, hydrogen fuel cell system manufacturer and technology developer focused on providing zero-emission power to decarbonize the most demanding industries, today announced the completion of a successful trial of its refuse collection Fuel Cell Electric Truck (FCET) -- developed in partnership with New Way Trucks -- with Mt. Diablo Resource Recovery (MDRR), a leader in sustainable waste and recycling management.\n\n[ ![Hyzon, Mt. Diablo, New Way logos](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2557481/Hyzon_Mt_Diablo_New_Way_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2557481/Hyzon_Mt_Diablo_New_Way_Logo.html)\n\nThe trial, which tested the hydrogen-powered vehicle on routes in parts of California including Concord, Pittsburg, Oakley, Rio Vista, and parts of unincorporated Contra Costa, marks a significant milestone in the adoption of zero-emission technology for heavy-duty applications in the waste and recycling sector.\n\nThe trial further demonstrated hydrogen's effectiveness as a sustainable, zero-emission alternative to diesel fuel, aligning with California's Advanced Clean Fleet requirements and furthering Mt.

These achievements mark a pivotal moment in Hyzon's journey and the broader transition to zero-emission transportation, which is now in active commercialization,\" said Parker Meeks, CEO of Hyzon. \"From securing North America's first-ever order for refuse fuel cell electric trucks to achieving start of production for our revolutionary 200kW fuel cell system and our innovative Class 8 fuel cell electric trucks, the third quarter was a success. Additionally, our ISO 9001 certification confirms our commitment to the highest quality standards and a step towards becoming a trusted and leading FCS OEM. On the back of our completed and continuing refuse and class 8 trials, which have exceeded our and our customers' expectations, we are well-positioned to capitalize on our active discussions with potential customers for orders. Additionally, the hydrogen fuel market is improving significantly, with fuel pricing that can enable cost-competitive operation of Hyzon's fuel cell trucks compared to diesel today. The market opportunity before us is substantial, and Hyzon is uniquely positioned to deliver high-performance, zero-emission solutions that meet the demanding needs of our customers across multiple sectors.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Business Highlights**\n\n**Commercial: Secured First Purchase Agreement; Large Fleet Customer Trial Programs Underway**\n\nHyzon secured a purchase agreement for North America's first 12 hydrogen-powered, refuse FCETs with recycling innovator, GreenWaste, contingent upon Hyzon meeting certain commercial terms and specifications as defined in the agreement. This pivotal order, announced on October 7, 2024, represents the first-ever refuse FCET order in North America, showcasing Hyzon's expanding reach into new market segments. The agreement follows a successful two-week trial of Hyzon's refuse FCET, which demonstrated the vehicle's capability to meet the demanding requirements of waste collection operations. Built in partnership with industry leader, New Way Trucks, these zero-emission vehicles are set to be delivered as soon as Q4 2025.\n\nThe Company continues to focus on large fleet customers in the North American Class 8 and refuse markets with the highest immediate commercial potential. The 200kW Class 8 FCET trial program and refuse FCET trial program began in July of this year, with 10 trials completed to date. All 10 trials have been confirmed as successful by Hyzon's trial customers, meaning that the trials met or exceeded the expectations set forth by the customer. Hyzon has now entered commercial negotiations with the majority of these parties for potential customer orders as the trial typically represents the final step in the development process with fleets prior to commercial agreement negotiations. The trial program has continued to expand to a total of over 30 fleets through February 2025, including those already completed as of November, up from the original 25 that were scheduled in July. The trial schedule represents an average of over 4,200 trucks per fleet and includes ten fleets with over 5,000 trucks.\n\nFrom a performance perspective, the FCETs are operating at near 100% availability with range, hill climb, and fuel efficiency performance that has surpassed both customer expectations and their experience with other zero emission trucks. This strong availability and performance is the result of over three years of technology and powertrain development, testing, and optimization, which now includes over 300,000 miles of on-road experience for the Hyzon fuel cell powertrain globally since 2021.\n\nImportantly, the Company continues to collect real-world data from the various challenging customer operations where these trucks are put to the test. From a fuel efficiency perspective, the refuse FCET has demonstrated 230% to 300% improvement relative to diesel while the Class 8 200kW trucks are observing 25% to 50% greater fuel efficiency. This is an important advantage as fleets look to total cost of ownership and operating cost comparisons to diesel. Additionally, the refuse FCETs are hauling as much as 30 tons of trash per day matching diesel performance, without refueling, and significantly outperforming battery electric vehicle alternatives, that can often only complete 50% to 60% of a typical diesel truck's full day's work.\n\n**Technology: Start of Production has been achieved and ISO 9001 Certification received**\n\nIn a series of significant milestones, Hyzon demonstrated substantial progress in its mission to decarbonize heavy-duty industries through advanced hydrogen fuel cell technology.\n\nOn October 8, 2024, National Hydrogen Fuel Cell Day, Hyzon announced the SOP for its revolutionary, single-stack, 200kW FCS at its Bolingbrook, Illinois facility. This achievement marks a pivotal moment for zero-emission technology manufacturing in the United States, as Bolingbrook becomes home to one of the country's largest fully-integrated fuel cell production facilities.\n\nThe 200kW FCS production milestone follows closely on the heels of Hyzon's previously announced SOP for its innovative Class 8 200kW FCET in September, 2024. This milestone, made possible through collaboration with Fontaine Modification, signifies Hyzon's transition from prototype to series production of high-performance, zero-emission alternatives to diesel in the heavy-duty transport sector.\n\nFurther solidifying its commitment to quality and industry-leading standards, on October 9, 2004, Hyzon secured an ISO 9001:2015 certification for its fuel cell manufacturing, design, and research and development activities. This certification, issued by Bureau Veritas, validates that Hyzon's development and production processes meet the highest international standards for quality, underscoring the Company's dedication to delivering safe, high-quality, and reliable zero-emission solutions.\n\nThese achievements collectively highlight Hyzon's technological leadership and manufacturing capabilities in the hydrogen fuel cell industry. With the ability to now produce 700 fuel cell systems per year over a three-shift operation, Hyzon is well-positioned to meet growing demand for zero-emission power solutions in heavy-duty applications. The Company's fully integrated manufacturing strategy, from proprietary membrane electrode assembly production to complete fuel cell systems, enables rapid product development and customer responsiveness, setting a new standard for the industry.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Updates**\n\n\"I am pleased with the significant commercial and operational progress we have made this year while simultaneously reducing our spend. We began 2023 with an average monthly net cash burn in excess of $15 million, and through intentional, strategic actions we now have line of sight to a $6.5 million monthly cash burn by year-end. This was enabled through operational efficiencies, footprint rationalization, and cost take-outs. We also expanded our access to capital markets through the Company's first equity raise since our listing and putting in place an ATM program. Our team has done a tremendous job,\" said Hyzon Chief Financial Officer Stephen Weiland.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents stood at $30.4 million. In July, the Company executed a registered direct offering raising approximately $3.8 million in net proceeds. This significantly improved trading liquidity, laying the groundwork for potential equity fundraising in the future, such as the implementation of an at-the-market program at the end of September. The Company has subsequently used the program to raise approximately $5 million in proceeds to further support the existing cash position and opportunity for successful trials to convert into orders.\n\n**Conference Call Information** The Hyzon management team will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter financial results on Wednesday, November 13, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\nParticipants can join the call at 1-888-800-7840 or international callers can use 1-646-307-1856 and enter the access code 5240234.

Hyzon’s 200kW\nhydrogen fuel cell system’s net output can meet the high-power demands of heavy-duty mobility.\n“Designing the Future of Fuel Cells” refers to Hyzon’s singular goal to accelerate the clean energy\ntransition by providing hydrogen fuel cells to power zero-emission vehicles with no compromise on\npower or range.\nThere are ~4.1 million class 8 trucks operating in the United States alone,i with ~68 million more heavy-\nduty trucks operating in the transportation industry globally.ii Diesel-fueled trucks account for ~11 billion\ntons of carbon emissions each year.iii As the demands on transport from the global economy continue to\nincrease, a solution must be found to reduce the emissions intensity of the trucking industry.\nThe enormity of the opportunity is matched by the enormity of the challenges to convert the world’s\ndiesel-powered trucking fleet to emissions-free vehicles. Hyzon has a practical solution to help with the\ntransition to clean power. The inertia of the diesel-fueled trucking industry must be fully appreciated.\nAlthough substantial challenges remain, Hyzon has made significant progress towards that goal by taking\na pragmatic approach to creating fuel cell systems for widely used heavy-truck platforms.iv Hyzon will\nbuild upon its 110kW fuel cell experience to commercialize the 200kW fuel cell system. This new offering\nwill accelerate the emissions-free transition by providing the required power and durability for heavy\nmobility.\n1\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nExecutive Summary ..................................................................................................................... 1\nStatus of Hydrogen Fuel Cell Development ........................................................................ 3\nAdvantages of Hyzon’s 200kW Design & Process ............................................................... 4\nSingle Stack Architecture Compact and Integrated System ................................................. 4\nMultiple Stack: .................................................................................................................................................... 5\nSingle Stack: ........................................................................................................................................................ 6\nTechnological Hurdles of the Single Stack 200kW Fuel Cell System Design ...................... 6\nSystem Compactness ........................................................................................................................................ 6\nSystem Complexity & Reliability ...................................................................................................................... 7\nManufacturing Cost ........................................................................................................................................... 7\nAdvantages of Hyzon’s 200kW Design & Process ............................................................... 8\nHybrid Bipolar Plates .................................................................................................................. 9\nPower Generation ............................................................................................................................................ 10\nReduction in Contact Resistance ................................................................................................................... 10\nImproved Heat Distribution & Water Management ................................................................................... 10\nOther Benefits of Hybrid BPP Design .......................................................................................................... 11\nHyzon’s proprietary 7-layer Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) Design and\nManufacturing ............................................................................................................................. 11\nManufacturing Expertise ................................................................................................................................ 13\nDevelopment Plan and Path Forward .................................................................................. 15\nUpcoming Milestones ................................................................................................................. 16\nAppendix ...................................................................................................................................... 17\nHyzon’s 15-Cell Short Stack Performance Testing with Different Cathode Stoichiometry\nat AVL[i] ........................................................................................................................................ 17\nHyzon 15-Cell Short Stack Performance Testing: Cathode Humidity Impact at AVL ....... 18\nList of Patent Applications Protecting Hyzon’s 200kW ........................................................ 19\nHyzon Motors USA INC. - Patent Control Summary as of April 19, 2023 ............................ 19\nGovernment Subsidy Information ............................................................................................ 20\nReferences ................................................................................................................................... 21\n2\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nSTATUS OF HYDROGEN FUEL CELL DEVELOPMENT\nHyzon continues to advance the state-of-the-art fuel cell systems for heavy truck-duty applications.\nDecades of experience in on-road fuel cell applications with real-world mileage in fuel cell trucks upfit\nwith Hyzon’s 110kW and 120kW (“100kW-range”) fuel cell system technology advance the development\nand manufacturing of the flagship single stack 200kW fuel cell system.\nParallel workstreams allow for a 2024 Start-of-Production (“SoP”) of this new offering. Concurrent\nactivities include Membrane Electrode Assembly (“MEA”) performance and stress testing, short stack\nperformance and durability testing, Fuel Cell System (“FCS”) characterization, in-vehicle testing, factory\nprocess optimization, and pilot builds of B- and C-Sample systems.\nAn integrated management structure with close coordination across operational groups is required to\nadvance development of this multifaceted project. Fuel cell test results feed directly into engineering\nand manufacturing teams, while vehicle testing and customer demonstrations are regularly monitored by\nengineering and commercial teams. Results to-date show that the Hyzon unit cell has stable and\npredictable performance in Accelerated Stress Testing (“AST”), and low sensitivity to Relative Humidity\nand Cathode Stoichiometry.\nCurrently, the majority of the hydrogen fuel cell industry is focused on developing and producing fuel\ncells in the 100kW range. Although Hyzon’s fuel cell stack manufacturing is controlled inhouse, BoP\ncomponents are sourced externally. Since component suppliers have largely positioned themselves to\nserve the 100kW development efforts, a supplier strategy and supply chain to support the production of\nthe 200kW FCS had to be created. By developing strong relationships with suppliers of key BoP\ncomponents, such as air compressors, cathode humidifiers, Direct Current/Direct Current (“DC/DC”)\nconverters, and coolant pumps, Hyzon has secured access. BoP components are purpose-built by many of\nthese suppliers for the Hyzon 200kW fuel cell systems. To ensure the highest quality, these components\nare tested and fully validated for the demanding requirements of commercial vehicle operating\nenvironments prior to delivery.\nHyzon is laser-focused on the highest quality SoP. When creating breakthrough technology, challenges\nare expected. Hyzon’s highly skilled team has already achieved dramatic technological advances to bring\nthe single stack 200kW to this point of development and is well positioned to overcome the next set of\nchallenges. Hyzon remains on track to meet validation milestones and production goals.\n3\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nADVANTAGES OF HYZON’S 200KW DESIGN & PROCESS\nSingle Stack Architecture\nCOMPACT AND INTEGRATED SYSTEM\nHeavy-duty trucks require high-power output for optimized mobility, fuel economy, and performance.\nHigh-power output demands are difficult to meet with individual hydrogen fuel cell systems. To meet the\npower requirements lacking in a single system truck, Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) have\nopted to combine two complete sets of 90-150kW fuel cell systems to generate the necessary power.\nHyzon’s 200kW fuel cell system features a single stack that generates enough electricity to meet these\nrequirements.\nAs explained below in the Bipolar Plate (“BPP”) section, Hyzon’s proprietary BPP design allows for a\ncompact fuel cell stack with uniform distribution of reactant gases and coolant, and tolerance to shock\nand vibration loads expected in mobility applications.\nOur inhouse anode module design is compact and seamlessly integrates all components to the stack:\nhydrogen supply injectors, pressure sensors, water separator, purge valves, and recirculation ejector. The\nfuel cell controller (“FCU”) precisely regulates the anode main supply, and water and nitrogen purging.\nThe anode module is directly mounted to the stack housing, minimizing the piping connections, and\nsealing surfaces.\nA fuel cell needs a DC/DC voltage converter to work with a lithium-ion battery in the vehicle, an air\ncompressor motor inverter, a positive temperature coefficient (“PTC”) heater (required for pre-heating\nduring sub-zero conditions), and a high voltage (“HV”) to low voltage (“LV”) DC/DC down-converter for\n12/24Vdc power systems.\nWhile other companies are dependent upon third-party suppliers to source multiple components, Hyzon\nhas collaborated with its supplier network to design its own multiple-in-one DC/DC power distribution\nunit (“PDU”) that delivers all the required power conversion and distribution functions.\nThis PDU is connected to the fuel cell’s positive and negative terminals through embedded bus bars, as\nopposed to externally connected HV and LV connectors and cables. Hyzon’s integrated design eliminates\nthe external connectors and cables that are bulky, heavy, costly, and susceptible to water ingression and\nconnection failures.\nThe single stack, anode module, and PDU form a streamlined high-power-density assembly. The\noptimized dimensions allow the assembly to be packaged in both bonneted and cabover trucks once it is\nconnected to the other BoP components.\nHyzon’s proprietary cathode module design integrates all components into a single unit. The layout\nreduces several plumbing parts and connections thereby reducing assembly time, saving packaging space,\n4\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nand reducing weight. This is a far more efficient design than other industry alternatives that require a\nseparate humidifier, intercooler, and cathode flow control valves.\nThe thoughtful layout of other key BoP components such as the air compressor, water pump, fuel cell\ncontrol unit (FCU), etc., maximizes available space to achieve a high performance and robust fuel cell\nsystem.\nAnother distinguishing fact is the system design and fuel cell production are done entirely inhouse with\nBoP components sourced from Hyzon’s strategic network of suppliers.\nMULTIPLE STACK:\nTo achieve 200kW net output power without a single stack fuel cell system, two 100kW-range systems\nneed to be installed, which requires multiple sets of BoP components.\n• Boost or bidirectional DC/DC convertors\n• Air compressors\n• Humidifiers\n• Intercoolers\n• Water pumps\n• Anode components\n• Controllers\n• 12/24VDC DC/DC convertors\no Pressure regulators\no Temperature sensors\no Electric valves\no HV cables\no LV harnesses\n5\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nSINGLE STACK:\nWith Hyzon’s single stack 200kW fuel cell system, the packaging space, cost, and integration burden are\nsignificantly reduced.\nBenefits\n• No interoperability issues\n• More compact\n• Lighter\n• Scalable mass production\n• Fewer parts\n• Lower Cost\nHyzon’s Single Stack 200kW Fuel Cell System\nTechnological Hurdles of the Single Stack 200kW Fuel Cell System Design\nEach distinct benefit enjoyed by the 200kW fuel cell system required an innovative approach to overcome\nits corresponding technological hurdle.\nSYSTEM COMPACTNESS\nTo achieve a comparable net power level, a multiple stack system requires approximately 30% more\nspace for packaging than a single 200kW system. To generate the equivalent power with less space,\nHyzon has developed a new and improved fuel cell design. Hyzon has been able to reduce fuel cell system\npackaging size by increasing the unit cell power density using Hyzon’s patented hybrid BPP and MEA\ndesign.\n6\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nSYSTEM COMPLEXITY & RELIABILITY\nThe greater the complexity of the system, the higher the probability of interoperability issues. It may be\nproblematic to find the source of failure in a complex system due to difficulties in determining which\ninteraction of the multiple components is not performing to specifications, or which component is\nresponsible.\nThe single stack architecture prevents the need for multiple sets of BoP components (e.g., bidirectional\nDC/DC convertors, air compressors, humidifiers, water pumps, anode components, controllers), which\nwould be required in the multiple stack architecture favored by Hyzon competitors.\nWith clear advantages, Hyzon believes that single stack architecture will ultimately be the prevailing\nindustry design. Hyzon has developed sophisticated system controls and software to manage the\nintegrated system design, allowing for crucial real-time insights into stack performance.\nThe creation of the 200kW is the culmination of years of accumulated R&D and productization. The\nsingle-system design is based on the lessons of multiple product development generations dedicated to\nimproving fuel cells.\nA drawback of eliminating the need for duplicate parts is a loss of redundancy in the event of a system\nfailure. To obviate the need for redundancy, Hyzon is conducting robust durability testing to verify that\nthe 200kW will perform as expected.\nMANUFACTURING COST\nHyzon’s single stack 200kW system costs 25% less to produce than two 100kW-range systems. The single\nstack system has fewer expensive components such as air compressors, humidifiers, and DC/DC\nconverters which lowers input costs. Labor costs are also lower, as fewer parts need to be installed.\nFurther, Hyzon uses roll-to-roll (or continuous) MEA production equipment, increasing production\ncapacity. The design of the integrated PDU, integrated anode and cathode modules, as well as the roll-to-\nroll MEA manufacturing process and the hybrid BPP manufacturing approach bring down the total cost of\nthe fuel cell system.\n7\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nFUEL CELL PERFORMANCE\nCompared to Hyzon’s 100kW-range, the 200kW has much higher fuel efficiency at a given power output,\nsignificantly improving the total cost ownership of the trucks. Compared to test data from the 120kW\ntruck, early testing of the 200kW truck at a test track, using similar payload and route simulations on a flat\nroad, showed approximately 20% increase in miles per kg of hydrogen. When the fuel cell operates at\nhigher efficiencies, the integration burden of the cooling system is reduced, as is the stress on the stack\nand BoP components. Additionally, when two 100kW-range fuel cell systems are used, maintaining both\nat the optimal operating efficiency simultaneously is more complex than maintaining a single stack 200\nkW system at the optimal operating point.\nADVANTAGES OF HYZON’S 200KW DESIGN & PROCESS\n8\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nHybrid Bipolar Plates\nGraphite Plate\nMetallic Plate\nHybrid bi-polar plate—MEA schematics\nBipolar plates (BPPs) form the backbone of the fuel cell stack. BPPs play a critical role in distributing\nreactant gases, coolant, and heat, carrying current from the MEAs to the end plates, removing water, and\nseparating the individual cells. The performance of the stack, as well as its expected lifetime are highly\ndependent on the proper functioning of BPPs.\nIn the race to achieve total cost of ownership parity for hydrogen fuel cell systems with the internal\ncombustion engine, BPPs are a competitive focal point. They make up a significant percentage of the\nstack material cost, volume, and weight, and are thus a key determinant to market adoption.\nGraphite plates are a proven technology which typically provide for better durability, but they tend to be\nbulky, heavy, and difficult to start in cold temperatures (e.g., -30 degrees C). All-metallic plates typically\nhave a thinner plate structure and higher power density, but tend to be challenged by corrosion over\ntime, making long lifetime durability a challenge. While each plate technology type can have its benefits\nand challenges, Hyzon has taken the best of both, innovating the specific design of the BPP to\nincorporate the benefits each can provide, while reducing the potential downsides of each.\n9\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nHyzon has a patented hybrid BPP. It is comprised of a graphite plate for cathode and a titanium plate for\nanode. Hyzon’s unique flow-field designs on both cathode and anode plate and materials enables not\nonly uniform flow distribution of reactants (H2 and O2) to MEA but also effective removal of product\nwater for high performance and durability. Each side of the plate is independently designed to create a\ndurable, highly conductive flow-field, tailored to the specific requirements and environment with which it\ninteracts. Through a unique combination of graphite and metallic surface engineering, Hyzon’s hybrid\nbipolar plates are corrosion-resistant, thin, and highly resistant to reactant gas leakage, significantly\ncontributing to the fuel cell stack’s durability, power density, and efficiency. Hyzon’s IP tailors the\nmaterial of each type of plate to the specific mobility high power density use case, minimizing thickness,\nimproving durability, and increasing performance. The process Hyzon utilizes to treat the material and\ndesign the structures within the plates enables a hybrid BPP that is highly productive, durable, and high\nperformance from a power density, water management and heat management standpoint.\nPOWER GENERATION\nHyzon’s hybrid plate and sophisticated flow-field designs allow Hyzon to increase cell size and active area\nwithout a notable tradeoff in performance. A larger active area enables high power density due to the\nhigher current capability, therefore, more suitable for heavy-duty truck applications. Heavy-duty trucks\nrequire continuous high-power to operate, while passenger cars typically run at low-to-medium rated\npower. Hyzon 200kW with the hybrid BPP can operate continuously at high power, while metallic plate\nfuel cells usually operate at the middle of the rated power.\nREDUCTION IN CONTACT RESISTANCE\nIn a fuel cell, electrons flow through and along the BPP. Graphite plates can be fabricated to achieve high\nsurface flatness. Due to its stiffness, the graphite plate can support the large thin metallic plate to ensure\nlarger contact surface area between the two plates, resulting in less contact resistance for electric\nconductivity and more uniform distribution of contact points. Less resistances in both through-plane and\nin-plane directions contribute to higher stack efficiency.\nIMPROVED HEAT DISTRIBUTION & WATER MANAGEMENT\nReduced contact resistance with uniform distribution of contact points permits large stack current\nfluxing throughout the fuel cell, thus minimizing the possibility of localized hot spots. Superior in-plane\nthermal conductivity of the graphite plate allows high tolerance of cell-to-cell voltage variation and\nuniform heat distribution, improving power delivery and thereby reducing the risk of overheating.\nUse of a graphite plate enables a much finer and more diversified flow channel design which is needed\nfor a highly uniform cathode air distribution and better water management.\n10\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nOTHER BENEFITS OF HYBRID BPP DESIGN\nThe patented hybrid design offers additional benefits that neither the full graphite nor full metallic plates\ncan replicate, as each individual plate has their respective drawbacks. For instance, a full graphite plate is\nmuch heavier and thicker. The thickness of the BPP will limit the number of unit cells that can be stacked\nup. If the stack is too long, it will encounter other issues such as uneven flow distribution among\nindividual cells. The heavier and longer stack may not be able to endure the shock and vibration loads in\nmotive applications. The full graphite plate design therefore has less power density and an inability to\nmake a high-power single stack. The length of the full graphite plate will also become a packaging issue\nfor the available space in heavy-duty trucks.\nAlternatively, a fully metallic plate design has shorter use life with the inability to operate at high power\nfor a sustained period of time. Metallic plates are more susceptible to corrosion by the cathode\nelectrochemical reaction. Hyzon’s hybrid plates do not encounter corrosion since a metallic plate is used\non the anode side.\nHybrid BPP design avoids the leak issue seen in full graphite plate design on the anode side due to the\nhigh porosity in the graphite plate where hydrogen tends to leak through.\nA hybrid BPP is less expensive to produce because it does not require a complex and high-precision driven\nstamping and welding process required by full metallic plates.\nHyzon’s proprietary 7-layer Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) Design and\nManufacturing\nDESIGN & SOURCING\nAll the electrochemical reactions to generate power – the hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction –\ntake place within the MEA. Its core components consist of a membrane, catalyst, ionomers, gas diffusion\nlayers (“GDL”), and gaskets.\nHyzon designs and manufactures its MEAs in-house, which provides the strategic advantage of controlling\nthe entire development process. Keeping production in-house also creates the opportunity to generate\nsignificant intellectual property. Hyzon sources the component parts of an MEA (membrane, catalysts,\nionomers and GDL) directly from suppliers. This offers potential procurement savings in comparison to\nsourcing the MEA from suppliers, but also gives flexibility to design electrodes specific to Hyzon’s product\nneeds.\nDeep technical knowledge and experience enable Hyzon to select the highest quality components and\ndesign the optimal composition, which has a direct impact on the electrode structure, performance, and\ndurability of the catalyst layer coating.\n11\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nThe formulation of the catalyst ink, with precise selection of catalyst materials, additives and solvents\nenables Hyzon to produce suitable electrode structure for high and robust fuel cell performance.\nThe figure below illustrates the key stages in designing the catalyst ink features of Hyzon’s proprietary\nMEA.\nFuel cell catalyst ink-Material sourcing, design, and production process flow\nThe prevailing technology for both anode and cathode catalysts are Platinum based. The anode’s function\nis to separate hydrogen molecules into protons and electrons. The cathode catalyst’s function is to\nreduce oxygen in the MEA to produce water.\nThough there have been significant efforts, both in industry and academia, devoted to developing\nadvanced cathode catalysts and catalyst layers to counter slower oxygen reduction reactions at the\ncathode compared to hydrogen oxidation reaction at the anode, the anode catalyst layer can also\nencounter issues, during freeze operations or fuel starvations. These are key technological hurdles for\nfuel cell development. Hyzon’s innovative anode designs increase robustness, creating minimal\nperformance and durability variations within the stack during adverse conditions such as freeze\noperation.\nIn Hyzon’s cathode catalyst layer architecture, the electrodes have been designed with suitable ionomers\nand catalysts for enhanced proton transport in the catalyst layer under wider relative humidity\nconditions. By optimizing the properties of the cathode catalyst layer such as surface area, porosity and\npore size, accessibility of oxygen to the catalyst surface is increased, boosting the performance of fuel\ncells. In addition, selecting and optimizing the GDL facilitates better gas transport and water\nmanagement.\n12\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nHyzon is also developing novel stabilizers to improve membrane lifetime without tradeoff in\nperformance. Hyzon is committed to further improving the performance at high current densities beyond\nits current designs, using innovative electrode designs. Hyzon currently and exclusively owns 20 US and\nInternational MEA-related patent applications.\nMANUFACTURING EXPERTISE\nHyzon also has an innovative MEA manufacturing process shown in the figures below:\nMEA production process flow\n13\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\n1. The catalyst ink is processed using proprietary ink\nmixers and characterized based on key properties\nsuch as solids, viscosity and particle size before\ncoating. After validation, the catalyst ink is coated\non continuous roll-to-roll coating equipment,\nfollowed by the catalyst layer lamination (3-layers),\ngasket lamination (5-layers) and GDL lamination (7-\nlayers).\n2. Cathode catalyst layer is coated on the\nmembrane (the layer where oxygen reduction\nreaction happens at the cathode in the MEA).\n3. Anode catalyst layer on a substrate film, e.g.,\nTeflon, (where hydrogen oxidation happens at\nthe anode in the MEA).\n4. The anode catalyst layer on the substrate is\ntransferred to the non-coated side of the\nmembrane by roll-to-roll lamination equipment\n(anode catalyst layer/membrane/cathode catalyst\nlayer constitute the 3-layer.\n5. In the next step, the 3-layer roll is integrated into\nsub-gasket by roll-to-roll equipment (two sub\ngaskets: one for anode side and one for cathode\nside) to form the 5-layers.\nProton Exchange\n6. Finally, gas diffusion layers are integrated by roll-to- Membrane\nroll equipment (one for anode and one for cathode)\nto form 7-layers, referred to as the MEA.\nIllustration of MEA Structure (at right)\nCatalyst\nLayer\nGas Diffusion Layer\n14\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nWe believe Hyzon’s custom designed and engineered manufacturing equipment is key for advanced MEA\nmanufacturing.\nCurrently, the yield rates,v depending on the process step, vary between 93 and 99%, including the\ndesign scraps.\nHyzon uses a roll-to-roll/continuous approach to increase production capacity of MEAs. Hyzon is\npreparing in advance to meet the demands by having multiple coating lines fully functional, with separate\ncoating lines for anode and cathode. Hyzon’s custom engineered equipment, 3-layer (catalyst layer\nlamination), 5-layer (gasket lamination), and 7-layer (GDL lamination) can be quickly and efficiently\nupgraded to meet higher demand of MEAs for Hyzon’s fuel cell stacks.\nHyzon also integrates in-line visual inspection and advanced microscopic tools to increase quality and\nreduce defects and rejects.\nDEVELOPMENT PLAN AND PATH FORWARD\nThe merits of the single stack 200kW fuel cell system architecture are compelling. Although the progress\nto date has been impressive, there are still major milestones to accomplish on the path to produce fuel\ncell systems at scale. Maturing B-sample systems built at Hyzon’s Bolingbrook, IL facility is an important\nstep in the product development process. These 200kW fuel cell systems are fully-functional systems as\ndemonstrated in laboratory and vehicle testing today. Each unit assembled in pilot builds increases the\ndata set. As more data is gathered and analyzed, efficiency and quality in production processes can be\nimproved.\nAs Hyzon advances toward the system SoP, three key initiatives continue:\n1. Fuel cell stack and system testing for SoP and durability:\nReal-world and worst-case operating profiles are simulated in the laboratory environment at\nHyzon. This testing is both time and cost efficient, as it allows for many samples and conditions to\nbe run simultaneously, without the complexity of full-vehicle testing. This MEA and short stack\ntesting will continue past SoP; the data collected will provide invaluable insights to inform both\nproduction quality and R&D efforts for future products.\n2. Design release and manufacturing qualification:\nTesting data gathered and pilot build experience will help shape the final engineering design\nrelease and provide crucial information to refine the manufacturing process. B-Sample builds\nusing production-intent processes allow manufacturing stakeholders to improve upon the\nprocess. Critical assessment of the early production is essential to a successful SoP. Similarly, B-\nSample designs are fully functional, even if built using prototype tools. As such, performance and\ndurability should be representative of the C-Sample units. As with any technology development\n15\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nprogram, any issues that arise in B-Sample testing can be addressed prior to production design\nfreeze and software release.\n3. On-vehicle durability testing:\nVehicle operating profiles can be simulated in the laboratory, but vehicle testing provides an\nopportunity to evaluate components and systems in situ, with representative interfaces and\nenvironmental conditions. Both laboratory and in-vehicle testing are crucial for a robust product\ndevelopment program. Considered confirmation testing, vehicle-level testing is resource\nintensive, but a valuable “final check” to demonstrate that all systems will perform as intended\nfor customers. On road operation and evaluation may involve Hyzon drivers or early-adopters,\nand can run for thousands of miles, across many different terrains and climactic conditions.\nUpcoming Milestones\nThe chart below shows the major milestones Hyzon plans to execute to bring the 200 kW single FCS\nthrough its SoP and durability plan. Several major milestones have already been achieved, including\nproducing and testing three B1 Sample 200 KW FCS’s, and completing the Design Verification Plan (DVP).\nAdditionally, the 6x 200 kW FCS B2 Samples are well underway, targeted for testing by end of 1H 2023.\n16\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nAPPENDIX\nHyzon’s 15-Cell Short Stack Performance Testing with Different Cathode\nStoichiometry at AVL[i]\n17\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nHyzon 15-Cell Short Stack Performance Testing: Cathode Humidity Impact at AVL\nHyzon’s Short Stack made at Bolingbrook and tested at AVL, Canada\n18\nDESIGNING THE FUTURE OF FUEL CELLS\nList of Patent Applications Protecting Hyzon’s 200kW\nCategory # Description\nMEA 20 Covers, electrode design, membrane catalyst, gas diffusion later\nBPP (Bipolar plate) 6 Flow field design, durability improvement\nUnit cell 6 Sealing, bonding\nFC Stack 4 Stack design, assembly\nBalance of plant (BOP) 4 Humidifier\nFuel Cell System 2 Modular boost converter\nHydrogen Storage System 1 Modular storage system\nVehicle 7 Semi-truck body, styling, e drive, headlight\nBattery 18 Battery SOC management, usability in FCEV\nNote: These are exclusively filed by Hyzon Motors.
