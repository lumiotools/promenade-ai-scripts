(NASDAQ: MQ**), the global modern card issuing platform, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\nThe Company reported Total Processing Volume (TPV) of $74 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 30%. The Company reported Net Revenue of $128 million and Gross Profit of $90 million, representing increases of 18% and 24%, respectively, year-over-year. GAAP Net Loss for the quarter was $29 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $9 million. \n\n\"In the third quarter our true growth trajectory was back on display as we lapped the Block contract renewal, while continuing to demonstrate operational discipline to fuel strong Adjusted EBITDA. We combined this with several new product announcements that further enhance the Marqeta platform to provide transformative payment solutions at scale for our expanding customer base,” said Simon Khalaf, CEO at Marqeta. \n\nMarqeta highlighted several recent business updates that demonstrate its current business momentum: \n\n  * Marqeta introduced a Portfolio Migration service that reduces complexity for customers upgrading existing card programs onto the Marqeta platform, without impacting their existing cardholder experience. This ability allows for the seamless migration of customers from competitor platforms to Marqeta. Completed at the end of October, Marqeta successfully migrated millions of Klarna cards in Europe onto its platform from Klarna’s incumbent processor. \n\n\n  * Marqeta unveiled Marqeta Flex, an industry-leading solution that revolutionizes how BNPL loans can be delivered inside payment apps and wallets. Marqeta Flex is intended to increase BNPL’s acceptance and provide consumers with access to personalized BNPL options inside of the payment apps they use most often. Marqeta also announced Affirm and Klarna as the first BNPL providers to be integrated into Marqeta Flex and Branch, which is used by a large number of Uber drivers, as the first application to support Marqeta Flex. \n\n\n  * UX Toolkit, also introduced this quarter, is an addition to Marqeta's portfolio of card program management tools. The UX Toolkit includes user interface components that can be customized and enhanced to improve cardholder touchpoints. The UX Toolkit will allow Marqeta’s customers to create front-end modern payment experiences from scratch with fewer development resources required. This will further enhance Marqeta’s leadership in program management and enable its customers to deliver better user experiences for their cardholders. \n\n\n\n**Operating Highlights**\n\n**_In thousands, except percentages and per share data. % change is calculated over the comparable prior-year period (unaudited)_** |  **Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **%** **Change** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,** |  **%** **Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Financial metrics:**  \nNet revenue  |  $127,967 |  $108,891 |  18  |  %  |  $371,205 |  $557,349 |  (33  |  %)   \nGross profit  |  $90,132 |  $72,508 |  24  |  %  |  $253,646 |  $246,281 |  3  |  %   \n_Gross margin_ |  _70_ |  _%_ |  _67_ |  _%_ |  _3 ppts_ |  _68_ |  _%_ |  _44_ |  _%_ |  _24 ppts_  \nTotal operating expenses  |  $132,363 |  $142,334 |  (7  |  %)  |  $240,687 |  $472,960 |  (49  |  %)   \nNet (loss) income  |  ($28,643 |  )  |  ($54,990 |  )  |  48  |  %  |  $54,405 |  ($182,587 |  )  |  130  |  %   \n_Net (loss) income margin_ |  _(22_ |  _%)_ |  _(51_ |  _%)_ |  _29 ppts_ |  _15_ |  _%_ |  _(33_ |  _%)_ |  _48 ppts_  \nNet (loss) income per share - basic  |  ($0.06 |  )  |  ($0.10 |  )  |  40  |  %  |  $0.11 |  ($0.34 |  )  |  132  |  %   \nNet (loss) income per share - diluted  |  ($0.06 |  )  |  ($0.10 |  )  |  40  |  %  |  $0.10 |  ($0.34 |  )  |  129  |  %   \n**Key operating metric and Non-GAAP financial measures:**  \nTotal Processing Volume (TPV)  (in millions) 1 |  $73,899 |  $56,650 |  30  |  %  |  $211,192 |  $160,285 |  32  |  %   \nAdjusted EBITDA 2 |  $9,019 |  ($2,062 |  )  |  537  |  %  |  $16,429 |  ($5,586 |  )  |  394  |  %   \n_Adjusted EBITDA margin 2_ |  _7_ |  _%_ |  _(2_ |  _%)_ |  _9 ppts_ |  _4_ |  _%_ |  _(1_ |  _%)_ |  _5 ppts_  \nNon-GAAP operating expenses 2 |  $81,113 |  $74,570 |  9  |  %  |  $237,217 |  $251,867 |  (6  |  %)   \n1 TPV represents the total dollar amount of payments processed through our platform, net of returns and chargebacks.

Regarding Non-GAAP Measures_**\n\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Marqeta considers Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Non-GAAP operating expenses as supplemental measures of the company’s performance that are not required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. \n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization; share-based compensation expense; executive chairman long-term performance award; payroll tax related to share-based compensation; restructuring charges; acquisition-related expenses which consist of due diligence costs, transaction costs and integration costs related to potential or successful acquisitions, and cash and non-cash postcombination compensation expenses; income tax expense (benefit); and other income (expense), net, which consists of interest income from our short-term investments, realized foreign currency gains and losses, our share of equity method investments’ profit or loss, impairment of equity method investments or other financial instruments, and gain from sale of equity method investments. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our core operating results, including our operating efficiencies, from period to period. Additionally, we utilize Adjusted EBITDA as an input into our calculation of our annual employee bonus plans and performance-based restricted stock units. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue. This measure is used by management and our board of directors to evaluate our operating efficiency. \n\nWe define Non-GAAP operating expenses as total operating expenses adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization; share-based compensation expense; executive chairman long-term performance award; payroll tax related to share-based compensation; restructuring charges; and acquisition-related expenses which consists of due diligence costs, transaction costs and integration costs related to potential or successful acquisitions, and cash and non-cash postcombination compensation expenses. We believe that Non-GAAP operating expenses is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our core operating results, including our operating efficiencies, from period to period. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Non-GAAP operating expenses should not be considered in isolation, or construed as an alternative to net loss, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of the company's liquidity. In addition, other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than Marqeta does, which limits its usefulness in comparing Marqeta’s financial results with those of other companies. \n\nThe following table shows Marqeta's GAAP results reconciled to non-GAAP results included in this release: \n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet revenue  |  $  |  127,967  |  $  |  108,891  |  $  |  371,205  |  $  |  557,349   \nNet (loss) income  |  $  |  (28,643  |  )  |  $  |  (54,990  |  )  |  $  |  54,405  |  $  |  (182,587  |  )   \nNet (loss) income margin  |  (22  |  %)  |  (51  |  %)  |  15  |  %  |  (33  |  %)   \nTotal operating expenses  |  $  |  132,363  |  $  |  142,334  |  $  |  240,687  |  $  |  472,960   \n**Net (loss) income** |  **$** |  **(28,643** |  **)** |  **$** |  **(54,990** |  **)** |  **$** |  **54,405** |  **$** |  **(182,587** |  **)**  \nDepreciation and amortization expense  |  4,448  |  3,108  |  11,941  |  7,582   \nShare-based compensation expense(1) |  35,654  |  32,135  |  103,258  |  98,802   \nExecutive chairman long-term performance award(1) |  —  |  13,413  |  (144,617  |  )  |  39,801   \nPayroll tax expense related to share-based compensation  |  440  |  541  |  2,307  |  1,818   \nAcquisition-related expenses (2) |  10,708  |  18,270  |  30,581  |  64,420   \nRestructuring  |  —  |  297  |  —  |  8,670   \nOther income, net  |  (13,703  |  )  |  (15,074  |  )  |  (41,845  |  )  |  (37,508  |  )   \nIncome tax expense (benefit)  |  115  |  238  |  399  |  (6,584  |  )   \n**Adjusted EBITDA** |  **$** |  **9,019** |  **$** |  **(2,062** |  **)** |  **$** |  **16,429** |  **$** |  **(5,586** |  **)**  \n**_Adjusted EBITDA Margin_** |  **_7_** |  **_%_** |  **_(2_** |  **_%)_** |  **_4_** |  **_%_** |  **_(1_** |  **_%)_**  \n**Total operating expenses** |  **$** |  **132,363** |  **$** |  **142,334** |  **$** |  **240,687** |  **$** |  **472,960**  \nDepreciation and amortization expense  |  (4,448  |  )  |  (3,108  |  )  |  (11,941  |  )  |  (7,582  |  )   \nShare-based compensation expense(1) |  (35,654  |  )  |  (32,135  |  )  |  (103,258  |  )  |  (98,802  |  )   \nExecutive chairman long-term performance award(1) |  —  |  (13,413  |  )  |  144,617  |  (39,801  |  )   \nPayroll tax expense related to share-based compensation  |  (440  |  )  |  (541  |  )  |  (2,307  |  )  |  (1,818  |  )   \nRestructuring  |  —  |  (297  |  )  |  —  |  (8,670  |  )   \nAcquisition-related expenses (2) |  (10,708  |  )  |  (18,270  |  )  |  (30,581  |  )  |  (64,420  |  )   \n**Non-GAAP operating expenses** |  **$** |  **81,113** |  **$** |  **74,570** |  **$** |  **237,217** |  **$** |  **251,867**  \n(1) Prior period amounts related to the Executive Chairman Long-Term Performance Award have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.   \n(2) Acquisition-related expenses, which include transaction costs, integration costs and cash and non-cash postcombination compensation expense, have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA as such expenses are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and are not representative of the ongoing costs necessary to operate our business; instead, these are costs specifically associated with a discrete transaction.   \n  \nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin to the comparable GAAP measure for the fourth quarter of 2024 is not available due to the challenges and impracticability with estimating some of the items as such items cannot be reasonably predicted and could be significant. Because of those challenges, reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are not available without unreasonable effort. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241104895415r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241104895415/en/>\n\nIR Contact: Marqeta Investor Relations, IR@marqeta.com\n\nSource: Marqeta, Inc.\n\n[ RSS feeds ](/rss-feeds)\n\n**RSS feeds**\n\n[ Email alerts ](/resources/email-alerts)\n\n**Email alerts**\n\n[ Contact IR ](/resources/contact-ir)\n\n**Contact IR**\n\n##### Connect with us on social media.\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/marqetainc/) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marqeta) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/marqeta-inc/)\n\n![](https://id.rlcdn.com/464526.gif)\n\n![](https://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=56037124&tm=gtm002&Ver=2&mid=aa4f0992-d734-4632-8742-1bf177674e7e&bo=1&sid=14b210d0b16b11ef91d22b69050154d9&vid=14b2e5c0b16b11ef92598deb58f111f3&vids=1&msclkid=N&uach=pv%3D10.0&pi=918639831&lg=en-GB&sw=1920&sh=1080&sc=24&nwd=1&tl=Marqeta,%20Inc.%20%7C%20Marqeta%20Reports%20Third%20Quarter%202024%20Financial%20Results&p=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.marqeta.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fmarqeta-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results&r=&lt=4155&evt=pageLoad&sv=1&cdb=AQAQ&rn=883908)\n"

The fourth annual [State of Credit Report](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marqeta.com%2Fresources%2F2024-state-of-credit%3Futm_source%3Dpr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dfy24q4_web_pr_stateofcredit_announcement&esheet=54143480&newsitemid=20241029426991&lan=en-US&anchor=State+of+Credit+Report&index=2&md5=a3e9ec63a50dda4f84645c2305302558), released today at Money2020 in Las Vegas surveyed 3,000 people, including 2,000 in the United States, about their use of credit cards, Buy Now Pay Later products and preferences when seeking out new cards. The company’s research found that among people surveyed, credit card loyalty is close to nonexistent, economic uncertainty is leading to more people struggling to pay their credit card bills, and that people have high expectations for what a credit card can provide, but they’re not getting their needs met. \n\n**Even happy cardholders are on the lookout for better options**\n\nNearly three quarters (72%) of consumers who said they were satisfied with their credit card still said they plan to apply for a new card in the next year, and almost half (44%) of 18-43 year olds surveyed in the US plan to apply for a credit card in the next 12 months. Even people without plans to apply for a card could be swayed by the right offer. Eighty percent of US 18-43 year olds who had no plans on applying for a card reported that the right feature or reward could get them to apply for a new card, including cash back of $100 or more (51%), 0% interest rate the first year (41%), or a major points sign-up bonus (32%). \n\n“As even the best brands know, customer loyalty is fragile. Even among highly satisfied customers, people are always hunting for the next best thing, and the traditional methods of building loyalty haven’t caught up with the way people are using their cards today,” said Todd Pollak, Chief Revenue Officer, Marqeta. “Brands that don’t evolve to offer highly personalized, flexible card experiences that consumers have come to expect will be left behind.” \n\n**Expectations are high when it comes to credit cards, but needs are not being met**\n\nNearly one-third (32%) of US consumers surveyed said that they have stopped using a credit card in the past 12 months. Of US consumers who stopped using a credit card in the last year, one-quarter (25%) said they got a new card that better fits their needs, over one-third (36%) said the interest rate was too high, and 24% said they needed a higher credit limit. When asked what would lead them to use a credit card more frequently, US consumers cited better rewards (44%), lower interest rates (37%), and low or no annual fee (29%) as top reasons. \n\nPeople surveyed want more personalization, more flexible options and lower interest rates from their credit cards. They’re just not getting what they’re looking for. Nearly one-third (31%) of US consumers surveyed reported personalized rewards and faster access to rewards (35%), as “needs to have” for credit card perks. Given the economic environment, interest rates (44%) topped rewards (41%) as the top feature consumers surveyed are looking for when evaluating credit cards, with 39% of people surveyed looking for a higher credit limit, up from 26% in 2023. In addition: \n\n  * Forty-two percent of US consumers surveyed would be interested in a payment card that can switch between debit, credit and BNPL features and capabilities, increasing to 59% of consumers 25-44 years old, and 67% of consumers with plans to apply for a new credit card. \n  * Fifty-four percent of 18-34 year old US consumers surveyed consider 24/7 dedicated concierge services as a standard card feature, and 38% consider exclusive events a standard card feature as well. \n\n\n\n**People rely on credit, but are struggling to keep up**\n\nWhile credit is critical to driving people’s livelihoods and spending power, Marqeta’s new report shows that American consumers are struggling. According to the [Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorkfed.org%2Fmicroeconomics%2Fhhdc.html&esheet=54143480&newsitemid=20241029426991&lan=en-US&anchor=Federal+Reserve+Bank+of+New+York&index=3&md5=31f08be0c3dd04a7bee5f16b2272900b), credit card debt was at a record high of $1.14 trillion as of the second quarter of 2024, and the average credit card interest rate was [21.76% as of October 2024](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.federalreserve.gov%2Freleases%2Fg19%2Fcurrent%2F&esheet=54143480&newsitemid=20241029426991&lan=en-US&anchor=21.76%25+as+of+October+2024&index=4&md5=94ae017238aabc69f9c9c00d203c712a), up five percentage points from before the pandemic. Marqeta’s research found that 19% of US consumers surveyed reported missing a credit card payment in the past 12 months, with 57% of those missing a card payment for the first time ever. In addition: \n\n  * Forty-one percent of 18-44 year olds surveyed in the US reported their credit card debt is higher than it was 12 months ago. \n  * Thirty-nine percent of US consumers surveyed delayed making a major purchase on credit because of high interest rates. \n  * Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services have helped consumers unlock purchasing power during these fluctuating economic times, with 62% of BNPL users surveyed reporting that BNPL has helped them make ends meet in the past year, up from 46% in 2022. \n\n\n\nTo download the full report, please click [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marqeta.com%2Fresources%2F2024-state-of-credit%3Futm_source%3Dpr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dfy24q4_web_pr_stateofcredit_announcement&esheet=54143480&newsitemid=20241029426991&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=5&md5=54ea61daccd0906b2ca67a8872b0f702). \n\n**About Marqeta (NASDAQ: MQ)**\n\nMarqeta makes it possible for companies to build and embed financial services into their branded experience—and unlock new ways to grow their business and delight users.

The company has published its fourth annual [_2024_  _State of Credi_ _t_ report](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marqeta.com%2Fresources%2F2024-state-of-credit%3Futm_source%3Dpr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dfy24q4_web_pr_stateofcredit_announcement&esheet=54143486&newsitemid=20241029436201&lan=en-US&anchor=2024+State+of+Credit+report&index=1&md5=94c1891ecfe35f1570bb4c9cd6fcc3d5) which polled 3,000 consumers globally – including 1,000 in the United Kingdom – revealing that customer loyalty to credit cards is shifting, as the public explore new financial products and services that better meet their individual needs. \n\n**Consumers demand more from traditional credit cards**\n\nOver half (53%) of UK respondents confirmed that their credit card helped them to make ends meet in the last year, yet nearly half (48%) confirmed that none of their credit cards currently accrue rewards, loyalty points or other benefits. Of people that reported using more than one credit card, 43% confirmed they would use a credit card more frequently if better rewards were offered. \n\nEmbedded finance is also driving more demand in the UK for rewards and personalisation, with more consumers using financial services offered by non-financial providers to access benefits and loyalty points. For example, 30% of UK respondents confirm they own a credit card affiliated with a brand of store, a 25% increase in just 12 months since Marqeta’s [2023 State of Credit report.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.marqeta.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Famid-cost-living-crisis-uk-consumers-look-shake-how-they-access&esheet=54143486&newsitemid=20241029436201&lan=en-US&anchor=2023+State+of+Credit+report.&index=2&md5=5a255ba5c530ce744d29d073a86e7c41)\n\n**Traditional idea of ‘customer loyalty’ is shifting amid competitive landscape**\n\nAs people demand more from their financial services, traditional approaches to credit card loyalty are shifting, and consumers are increasingly on the lookout for new offers. For example, 45% of millennials (ages 28-43) are planning to apply for a credit card in the next 12 months. Even those without plans to apply for a card confirmed that they could be swayed by the right offer, including a cash back reward of £100 or more (47%) and zero interest rate for the first 12 months (40%). Similarly, among the 26% of respondents who stopped using a credit card in the past year, 27% said they did so because they found a new card that better suited their needs. \n\nThere has also been a noticeable shift in consumer attitudes toward the opportunities provided by emerging financial services, such as Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL). For example, 63% of UK BNPL users confirmed that the service helped them make ends meet during the last 12 months, and this rose to 70% amongst 44-59 year olds. People reported using BNPL due to the fact they helped them budget (44%), offered convenience (43%) and charged zero interest (39%). Additionally, the study goes on to reveal consumer appetite for choice and flexibility in new financial services, with 44% of UK respondents stating that they are interested in using a payment card that can switch between debit, credit and BNPL features. \n\n“Financial services companies need to look at the way the market is going and reinvent their approach to reflect the highly personalised, flexible financial experiences that consumers are now demanding,” said Marcin Glogowski, SVP, Managing Director Europe and UK CEO at Marqeta. \n\n**High interest rates create consumer credit card challenges**\n\nWhile credit is critical for consumers to maintain financial stability, Marqeta’s new report shows that the UK public is struggling with high interest rates. According to the [Moneyfacts Treasury Reports](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.moneyfactsgroup.co.uk%2Fmedia-centre%2Fgroup%2Fnarrowing-choice-of-providers-across-cards-and-loans%2F&esheet=54143486&newsitemid=20241029436201&lan=en-US&anchor=Moneyfacts+Treasury+Reports&index=3&md5=647f7cf9f9ce7733375ede4f63b4168a), the average purchase annual percentage rate (APR) on credit cards rose from 31.8% at the start of September 2023 to 35.5% at the start of September 2024, and respondents confirmed that a high number of people were struggling with credit card debt. Thirty percent of UK consumers revealed their debt was higher than it was this time last year, and nearly three quarters of people surveyed (74%) reported struggling to meet minimum monthly credit card payments during the last 12 months. Additionally, 13% of respondents reported that they’d missed a credit card payment in the past 12 months – for 66% of those, this was the first time they had ever missed a credit card payment. \n\n“Banks have done a very good job at monetising loans and credit, but by managing risk so effectively, the system has catered to wealthier people who have more assets,” said Marcin Glogowski, SVP, Managing Director Europe and UK CEO at Marqeta. “Expanding purchasing power to everybody requires significant investment in technology. For example, upgrading solutions to analyse reams of data to determine more about an applicant's credit request and personal requirements than has previously been possible. As the trend towards instant, digital, flexible, personalised payments accelerates, this will become a necessity to keep up with consumer demand.” \n\nTo download the full report, please click [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marqeta.com%2Fresources%2F2024-state-of-credit%3Futm_source%3Dpr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dfy24q4_web_pr_stateofcredit_announcement&esheet=54143486&newsitemid=20241029436201&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=4&md5=96c61cc2cdbc290a161b2a616fe3f050). \n\n**About Marqeta (NASDAQ: MQ)**\n\nMarqeta makes it possible for companies to build and embed financial services into their branded experience—and unlock new ways to grow their business and delight users.
