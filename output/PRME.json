(Nasdaq: PRME), a biotechnology company committed to delivering a new class of differentiated one-time curative genetic therapies, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and provided a business update.\n\n“In October, we presented the first _in vivo_ preclinical data from our Wilson’s Disease program, demonstrating that Prime Editors can efficiently correct pathogenic mutations, without introducing safety concerns or detectable off-target edits,” said Keith Gottesdiener, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Prime Medicine. “These data are meaningful both for our efforts in Wilson’s Disease – a devasting condition that is believed to affect more than 20,000 people in the United States and Europe, and for which there are currently no approved disease-modifying therapies – and for our efforts in liver disease programs more broadly. Our Wilson’s Disease program leverages our proprietary, universal LNP platform, and these interim results suggest that our LNP may successfully deliver increased potency, as well as an improved safety profile and biodistribution, compared to other commonly used LNPs in development. We look forward to advancing our Wilson’s Disease program toward an IND and/or CTA filing in the first half of 2026.”\n\nDr. Gottesdiener continued, “Also in recent months, we announced our decision to strategically prioritize a set of high value programs, each with a clear path to value inflection and the potential to unlock multiple follow-on opportunities. This includes our wholly owned efforts in CGD and Wilson’s Disease, as well as our efforts in cell therapy and cystic fibrosis, which we are advancing with support from Bristol Myers Squibb and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, respectively. We believe partnerships like these will continue to play a critical role as we build Prime Medicine, allowing us access to best-in-class expertise and non-dilutive capital and enabling us to more rapidly realize the full potential of Prime Editing.”\n\n**Recent Business Updates**\n\n**Pipeline Updates**\n\nIn September 2024, Prime Medicine unveiled its strategically focused pipeline and plans to prioritize a set of high value programs, each targeting a disease with well-understood biology and a clearly defined clinical development and regulatory path. Each prioritized program is also intended to serve as a beachhead, in that the modularity of the Prime Editing platform is expected to allow Prime Medicine to generate follow-on candidates rapidly and efficiently.\n\nThe prioritized programs sit across Prime Medicine’s core areas of focus (hematology, immunology and oncology, liver, and lung), and include _ex vivo_ hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) programs for the treatment of p47phox chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and X-linked CGD; _ex vivo_ T-cell therapies; a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) Prime Editor for the treatment of Wilson’s Disease; and LNP or adeno-associated virus (AAV) Prime Editors for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). In order to pursue these prioritized high value programs as rapidly as possible, the Company is identifying partnership opportunities to advance its other programs, including those for neurological diseases, cell therapy, ocular diseases and hearing loss.\n\n_**Hematology, Immunology and Oncology:**_\n\n  * In the third quarter of 2024, Prime Medicine initiated its global Phase 1/2 clinical trial of PM359 in the United States. The Phase 1/2 clinical trial is a multinational, first-in-human trial designed to assess the safety, biological activity and preliminary clinical activity of PM359 in adult and pediatric study participants. Prime Medicine expects to report initial clinical data from the Phase 1/2 trial in 2025. \n\n\n\n _**Liver:**_\n\n  * At the European Society for Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT) 31st Annual Congress (October 22-25, 2024), Prime Medicine presented data from multiple studies showcasing the potential of its proprietary, universal LNP platform to precisely deliver Prime Editors to correct disease-causing mutations in the liver, including in Wilson’s Disease. Prime Medicine’s universal LNP contains a GalNAc-targeting ligand (GalNAc-LNP), a validated mechanism for liver-specific delivery of gene editors. Highlights included:\n    * Preclinical data demonstrated that the delivery of Prime Editors using a GalNAc-LNP (GalNAc-LNP Prime Editor) resulted in increased potency, as well as improved safety profile and biodistribution, compared to traditional LNPs that have gone into the clinic.\n    * _In vivo_ proof-of-concept data from Prime Medicine’s GalNAc-LNP Prime Editor for the treatment of Wilson’s Disease, demonstrated up to 80% precise correction of the H1069Q mutation and restoration of ATP7B mRNA to wild-type levels in a humanized mouse model, as well as precise editing of liver cells in non-human primates (NHPs), with up to 51% precise editing with a surrogate H1069Q Prime Editor. In preclinical studies to-date, Prime Medicine observed significant reductions of copper accumulation in the livers of humanized mice. In both mouse and NHP studies, no detectable off-target edits or unintended edits at the target site were observed.\n  * Prime Medicine is completing the final stages of lead optimization and recently initiated investigational new drug (IND)-enabling activities for its Wilson’s Disease program, with an IND and/or clinical trial application (CTA) filing expected in the first half of 2026. Prime Medicine will present on its Wilson’s Disease program at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), to be held on November 15-19, 2024. Longer term, the Company expects to use its universal LNP across all liver disease programs, allowing more rapid and cost-efficient expansion into follow-on rare and non-rare liver indications.\n\n\n\n**Corporate Updates**\n\nIn September 2024, Prime Medicine entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb to develop and commercialize multiple Prime Edited _ex vivo_ T-cell therapies. Under the terms of the agreement, Prime Medicine received a $55 million upfront payment and a $55 million equity investment from Bristol Myers Squibb. Prime Medicine is also eligible to receive more than $3.5 billion in milestones, including up to $1.4 billion in development milestones and more than $2.1 billion in commercialization milestones, along with royalties on net sales.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Research and Development (R &D) Expenses:** R&D expenses were $40.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $41.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses: **G&A expenses were $14.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in G&A expenses was driven by personnel expenses, primarily related to an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss was $52.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $50.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * **Cash Position:** As of September 30, 2024, pro-forma cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash were $244.6 million, which includes the $55 million equity investment from Bristol Myers Squibb received in September 2024 and the $55 million up-front consideration received in October 2024. Cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash were $189.6 million, as compared to $135.2 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Financial Guidance** Based on its current operating plans, Prime Medicine expects that its pro-forma cash, cash equivalents and investments as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first half of 2026.\n\n**About Prime Medicine** Prime Medicine is a leading biotechnology company dedicated to creating and delivering the next generation of gene editing therapies to patients.
