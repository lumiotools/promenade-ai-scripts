Bartolacci, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated:\n\n“Our consolidated operating results for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter reflected another quarter of solid performance by our core businesses and, consistent with prior quarters, was impacted by continuing customer delays in our energy business. Our previously announced cost reduction program is now underway, as evidenced by the charges reflected in our GAAP results this quarter, and progressing well. Overall, we were pleased with the consolidated operating results as we again demonstrated the resilience of Matthews and our employees in mitigating the challenges faced by one of our segments. For the year ended September 30, 2024, consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $205.2 million.\n\n“The Memorialization segment reported higher adjusted EBITDA for the current quarter despite lower unit volumes, which were related to a decline in U.S. deaths compared to a year ago. Ongoing cost control efforts combined with improved price realization were the key drivers in the improvement in operating margins. This segment has done a tremendous job of maintaining its level of performance over the past several years despite the declines in unit volume following the pandemic.\n\n“We are also pleased to report that our SGK Brand Solutions segment reported another consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth. This segment has stabilized nicely over the last two years with modest improvements in margins and is continuing its recovery following the global impacts of the pandemic and the European impact of the Russia-Ukraine war. Sales for the segment increased compared to a year ago primarily reflecting improved pricing to mitigate inflationary cost increases, higher sales for the merchandising and private label businesses, and growth in the Asia-Pacific market.\n\n“Sales for the Industrial Technologies segment for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter declined from a year ago primarily resulting from further customer delays in our energy business. The current quarter also reflected a continued soft warehouse automation market; however, order rates have been improving recently which could bode well for a good recovery next fiscal year.\n\n“With respect to our cost reduction program, current quarter charges include non-cash goodwill impairment and other asset write-downs primarily in connection with our European operations, in addition to severance and other costs. The program is also targeting general and administrative cost reductions. For our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, we reported another quarter of lower corporate and non-operating costs compared to a year ago. For the year, corporate and non-operating costs were approximately 5% lower than last year.\n\n“During the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, we reduced our outstanding debt by $53.8 million. In addition, we completed the refinancing of outstanding senior notes due December 1, 2025. Due to current interest rates and the ongoing strategic review of our business portfolio, we opted for a shorter-term bond (three-year maturity) with an ability to call in one year. We are projecting higher operating cash flow next year as our working capital investments in fiscal 2024 begin to convert to operating cash flow, which will be partially mitigated by costs in connection with our cost reduction program.\n\n“Looking forward to fiscal 2025, we continue to face the uncertainty of project timing in our Industrial Technologies segment, specifically relating to our energy business. While we currently expect deliveries to be substantially completed during the year, quarterly timing is still difficult to forecast. Our cost reduction programs should mitigate some of this impact.\n\n“We expect another solid performance for our Memorialization business in fiscal 2025 as U.S. deaths appear to have generally normalized following COVID and we are projecting continued growth in our cremation-related products sales. Continued growth is also projected for our SGK Brand Solutions segment reflecting ongoing improvement in U.S. market conditions, more stable conditions in Europe, and further growth in the Asia-Pacific region. In the Industrial Technologies segment, our product identification business is projecting growth next year and we should start to realize benefits from the launch of a new printhead product, which is currently scheduled for the latter half of the fiscal year. Also, as noted earlier, recent improving order rates for warehouse automation solutions should support recovery in this business. With these considerations in mind, we remain cautious and are projecting adjusted EBITDA in the range of $205 million to $215 million for fiscal 2025.\n\n“Lastly, as growth opportunities for the Industrial Technologies segment continue to emerge, the Company has been exploring strategies with respect to its portfolio of businesses. Accordingly, we have retained J.P. Morgan to support the evaluation of potential strategic alternatives.”\n\n**Fourth Quarter Fiscal****2024****Consolidated Results (Unaudited)**\n\n_($ in millions, except per share data)_ | **Q4 FY2024** | **Q4 FY2023** | **Change** | **% Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nSales | $ | 446.7 | $ | 480.2 | $ | (33.5 | ) | (7.0)%  \nNet (loss) income attributable to Matthews | $ | (68.2 | ) | $ | 17.7 | $ | (85.9 | ) | NM  \nDiluted (loss) earnings per share | $ | (2.21 | ) | $ | 0.56 | $ | (2.77 | ) | NM  \nNon-GAAP adjusted net income | $ | 16.6 | $ | 30.3 | $ | (13.7 | ) | (45.2)%  \nNon-GAAP adjusted EPS | $ | 0.55 | $ | 0.96 | $ | (0.41 | ) | NM  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 58.1 | $ | 61.9 | $ | (3.8 | ) | (6.1)%  \n_Note: See the attached tables for additional important disclosures regarding Matthews’ use of non-GAAP measures as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures._  \n  \nConsolidated sales for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter were $446.7 million, compared to $480.2 million for the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, representing a decrease of $33.5 million.

On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, earnings for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter were $0.55 per share, compared to $0.96 per share a year ago. The net loss on a GAAP basis in the current fiscal quarter primarily reflected asset write-downs, including a goodwill impairment charge, and charges in connection with cost reduction programs. Adjusted EBITDA (net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other adjustments) for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter was $58.1 million, compared to $61.9 million a year ago, primarily reflecting lower adjusted EBITDA in the Industrial Technologies segment.\n\n**Fiscal****2024****Consolidated Results (Unaudited)**\n\n_($ in millions, except per share data)_ | **YTD FY2024** | **YTD FY2023** | **Change** | **% Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nSales | $ | 1,795.7 | $ | 1,880.9 | $ | (85.2 | ) | (4.5)%  \nNet (loss) income attributable to Matthews | $ | (59.7 | ) | $ | 39.3 | $ | (99.0 | ) | NM  \nDiluted (loss) earnings per share | $ | (1.93 | ) | $ | 1.26 | $ | (3.19 | ) | NM  \nNon-GAAP adjusted net income | $ | 67.0 | $ | 90.1 | $ | (23.1 | ) | (25.6)%  \nNon-GAAP adjusted EPS | $ | 2.17 | $ | 2.88 | $ | (0.71 | ) | (24.7)%  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 205.2 | $ | 225.8 | $ | (20.6 | ) | (9.1)%  \n_Note: See the attached tables for additional important disclosures regarding Matthews’ use of non-GAAP measures as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures._  \n  \nConsolidated sales for the year ended September 30, 2024 were $1.80 billion, compared to $1.88 billion a year ago, representing a decrease of $85.2 million, or 4.5%, from the prior year. Net loss attributable to the Company for the year ended September 30, 2024 was $59.7 million ($1.93 per share), compared to net income of $39.3 million ($1.26 per share) for fiscal 2023. On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, earnings for the year ended September 30, 2024 were $2.17 per share, compared to $2.88 per share last year. The net loss on a GAAP basis for the current fiscal year primarily resulted from asset write-downs, including a goodwill impairment charge, and charges in connection with cost reduction programs. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended September 30, 2024, was $205.2 million, compared to $225.8 million a year ago. The decrease reflected lower adjusted EBITDA for the Industrial Technologies and Memorialization segments, offset partially by higher adjusted EBITDA for SGK Brand Solutions and lower corporate and other non-operating costs.\n\n**Webcast**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast on Friday, November 22, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time to review its financial and operating results and discuss its corporate strategies and outlook.

limitation, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and EPS, constant currency sales, constant currency adjusted EBITDA, net debt and net debt leverage ratio. The Company defines net debt leverage ratio as outstanding debt (net of cash) relative to adjusted EBITDA. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing its performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company’s core operations including acquisition and divestiture costs, ERP integration costs, strategic initiative and other charges (which includes non-recurring charges related to certain commercial and operational initiatives and exit activities), stock-based compensation and the non-service portion of pension and postretirement expense. Constant currency sales and constant currency adjusted EBITDA remove the impact of changes due to foreign exchange translation rates. To calculate sales and adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis, amounts for periods in the current fiscal year are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates applicable to the comparable periods of the prior fiscal year. Management believes that presenting non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's core operations, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, forecast, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s results. The Company's calculations of its non-GAAP financial measures, however, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provided herein, provide investors with an additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company’s business that could not be obtained absent these disclosures.\n\n**ADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION (Unaudited)****(In thousands)**  \n---  \n**Three Months EndedSeptember 30,** |  **Year Ended****September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**Net (loss) income** | **$** | **(68,161** | **)** | **$** | **17,693** | **$** | **(59,660** | **)** | **$** | **39,136**  \nIncome tax provision (benefit) | 680 | (2,362 | ) | (9,997 | ) | 1,774  \n**(Loss) income before income taxes** | **$** | **(67,481** | **)** | **$** | **15,331** | **$** | **(69,657** | **)** | **$** | **40,910**  \nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests | — | 30 | — | 155  \nInterest expense, including RPA and factory financing fees(1) | 14,825 | 12,746 | 55,364 | 48,690  \nDepreciation and amortization* | 24,329 | 24,717 | 94,770 | 96,530  \nAcquisition and divestiture related items(2) ** | 11 | 848 | 5,576 | 5,293  \nStrategic initiatives and other charges(3) **† | 48,458 | 6,168 | 65,586 | 13,923  \nHighly inflationary accounting impacts (primarily non-cash)(4) | 132 | (1,714 | ) | 1,027 | 1,360  \nGoodwill and asset write-downs(5) | 33,574 | — | 33,574 | —  \nStock-based compensation | 4,169 | 3,673 | 18,478 | 17,308  \nNon-service pension and postretirement expense(6) | 112 | 84 | 439 | 1,640  \n**Total Adjusted EBITDA** | **$** | **58,129** | **$** | **61,883** | **$** | **205,157** | **$** | **225,809**  \n_Adjusted EBITDA margin_ | _13.0_ | _%_ | _12.9_ | _%_ | _11.4_ | _%_ | _12.0_ | _%_  \n_(1)__Includes fees for receivables sold under the RPA and factoring arrangements totaling_ _$1,192_ _and_ _$1,284_ _for the three months ended September 30,__2024_ _and_ _2023_ _, respectively, and_ _$4,830_ _and_ _$4,042_ _for the fiscal years ended September 30,__2024_ _and_ _2023_ _, respectively._  \n_(2)__Includes certain non-recurring costs associated with recent acquisition and divestiture activities, and also includes a gain of_ _$1,827_ _for the three months and fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 related to the divestiture of a business in the Industrial Technologies segment._  \n_(3)__Includes certain non-recurring costs associated with commercial, operational and cost-reduction initiatives and costs associated with global ERP system integration efforts.

Bartolacci, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated:\n“Our consolidated operating results for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter reflected another quarter of solid\nperformance by our core businesses and, consistent with prior quarters, was impacted by continuing\ncustomer delays in our energy business. Our previously announced cost reduction program is now\nunderway, as evidenced by the charges reflected in our GAAP results this quarter, and progressing well.\nOverall, we were pleased with the consolidated operating results as we again demonstrated the\nresilience of Matthews and our employees in mitigating the challenges faced by one of our segments.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2024, consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $205.2 million.\n“The Memorialization segment reported higher adjusted EBITDA for the current quarter despite lower unit\nvolumes, which were related to a decline in U.S. deaths compared to a year ago. Ongoing cost control\nefforts combined with improved price realization were the key drivers in the improvement in operating\nmargins. This segment has done a tremendous job of maintaining its level of performance over the past\nseveral years despite the declines in unit volume following the pandemic.\n“We are also pleased to report that our SGK Brand Solutions segment reported another consecutive\nquarter of year-over-year sales growth. This segment has stabilized nicely over the last two years with\nmodest improvements in margins and is continuing its recovery following the global impacts of the\npandemic and the European impact of the Russia-Ukraine war. Sales for the segment increased\ncompared to a year ago primarily reflecting improved pricing to mitigate inflationary cost increases, higher\nsales for the merchandising and private label businesses, and growth in the Asia-Pacific market.\nMatthews International Reports Results for Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2024\nPage 2 of 11\nNovember 21, 2024\n“Sales for the Industrial Technologies segment for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter declined from a year ago\nprimarily resulting from further customer delays in our energy business. The current quarter also\nreflected a continued soft warehouse automation market; however, order rates have been improving\nrecently which could bode well for a good recovery next fiscal year.\n“With respect to our cost reduction program, current quarter charges include non-cash goodwill\nimpairment and other asset write-downs primarily in connection with our European operations, in addition\nto severance and other costs. The program is also targeting general and administrative cost reductions.\nFor our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, we reported another quarter of lower corporate and non-operating\ncosts compared to a year ago. For the year, corporate and non-operating costs were approximately 5%\nlower than last year.\n“During the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, we reduced our outstanding debt by $53.8 million. In addition, we\ncompleted the refinancing of outstanding senior notes due December 1, 2025. Due to current interest\nrates and the ongoing strategic review of our business portfolio, we opted for a shorter-term bond (three-\nyear maturity) with an ability to call in one year. We are projecting higher operating cash flow next year\nas our working capital investments in fiscal 2024 begin to convert to operating cash flow, which will be\npartially mitigated by costs in connection with our cost reduction program.\n“Looking forward to fiscal 2025, we continue to face the uncertainty of project timing in our Industrial\nTechnologies segment, specifically relating to our energy business. While we currently expect deliveries\nto be substantially completed during the year, quarterly timing is still difficult to forecast. Our cost\nreduction programs should mitigate some of this impact.\n“We expect another solid performance for our Memorialization business in fiscal 2025 as U.S. deaths\nappear to have generally normalized following COVID and we are projecting continued growth in our\ncremation-related products sales. Continued growth is also projected for our SGK Brand Solutions\nsegment reflecting ongoing improvement in U.S. market conditions, more stable conditions in Europe,\nand further growth in the Asia-Pacific region. In the Industrial Technologies segment, our product\nidentification business is projecting growth next year and we should start to realize benefits from the\nlaunch of a new printhead product, which is currently scheduled for the latter half of the fiscal year. Also,\nas noted earlier, recent improving order rates for warehouse automation solutions should support\nrecovery in this business. With these considerations in mind, we remain cautious and are projecting\nadjusted EBITDA in the range of $205 million to $215 million for fiscal 2025.\n“Lastly, as growth opportunities for the Industrial Technologies segment continue to emerge, the\nCompany has been exploring strategies with respect to its portfolio of businesses. Accordingly, we have\nretained J.P. Morgan to support the evaluation of potential strategic alternatives.”\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Consolidated Results (Unaudited)\n($ in millions, except per share data) Q4 FY2024 Q4 FY2023 Change % Change\nSales $ 446.7 $ 480.2 $ (33.5) (7.0) %\nNet (loss) income attributable to Matthews $ (68.2) $ 17.7 $ (85.9) NM\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share $ (2.21) $ 0.56 $ (2.77) NM\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income $ 16.6 $ 30.3 $ (13.7) (45.2) %\nNon-GAAP adjusted EPS $ 0.55 $ 0.96 $ (0.41) NM\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 58.1 $ 61.9 $ (3.8) (6.1) %\nNote: See the attached tables for additional important disclosures regarding Matthews’ use of non-GAAP measures as well as reconciliations of\nnon-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures.\nMatthews International Reports Results for Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2024\nPage 3 of 11\nNovember 21, 2024\nConsolidated sales for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter were $446.7 million, compared to $480.2 million for\nthe fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, representing a decrease of $33.5 million.

September 30, 2024\nPage 7 of 11\nNovember 21, 2024\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIncluded in this report are measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP, including,\nwithout limitation, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and EPS, constant currency sales, constant\ncurrency adjusted EBITDA, net debt and net debt leverage ratio. The Company defines net debt\nleverage ratio as outstanding debt (net of cash) relative to adjusted EBITDA. The Company uses non-\nGAAP financial measures to assist in comparing its performance on a consistent basis for purposes of\nbusiness decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not\ndirectly reflect the Company’s core operations including acquisition and divestiture costs, ERP integration\ncosts, strategic initiative and other charges (which includes non-recurring charges related to certain\ncommercial and operational initiatives and exit activities), stock-based compensation and the non-service\nportion of pension and postretirement expense. Constant currency sales and constant currency adjusted\nEBITDA remove the impact of changes due to foreign exchange translation rates. To calculate sales and\nadjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis, amounts for periods in the current fiscal year are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates applicable to the comparable periods of the prior fiscal\nyear. Management believes that presenting non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because\nit (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by\nexcluding certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's core operations,\n(ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget,\nforecast, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise\nprovides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s results.\nThe Company's calculations of its non-GAAP financial measures, however, may not be comparable to\nsimilarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that the presentation of\nthese non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial\nmeasures and the reconciliations to those measures, provided herein, provide investors with an\nadditional understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company’s business that could not be\nobtained absent these disclosures.\nMatthews International Reports Results for Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2024\nPage 8 of 11\nNovember 21, 2024\nADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION (Unaudited)\n(In thousands)\nThree Months Ended Year Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet (loss) income $ (68,161) $ 17,693 $ (59,660) $ 39,136\nIncome tax provision (benefit) 680 (2,362) (9,997) 1,774\n(Loss) income before income taxes $ (67,481) $ 15,331 $ (69,657) $ 40,910\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests — 30 — 155\nInterest expense, including RPA and factory financing fees (1) 14,825 12,746 55,364 48,690\nDepreciation and amortization * 24,329 24,717 94,770 96,530\nAcquisition and divestiture related items (2) ** 11 848 5,576 5,293\nStrategic initiatives and other charges (3) ** † 48,458 6,168 65,586 13,923\nHighly inflationary accounting impacts (primarily non-cash) (4) 132 (1,714) 1,027 1,360\nGoodwill and asset write-downs (5) 33,574 — 33,574 —\nStock-based compensation 4,169 3,673 18,478 17,308\nNon-service pension and postretirement expense (6) 112 84 439 1,640\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA $ 58,129 $ 61,883 $ 205,157 $ 225,809\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 13.0 % 12.9 % 11.4 % 12.0 %\n(1) Includes fees for receivables sold under the RPA and factoring arrangements totaling $1,192 and $1,284 for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively, and $4,830 and $4,042 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(2) Includes certain non-recurring costs associated with recent acquisition and divestiture activities, and also includes a gain of $1,827 for the three\nmonths and fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 related to the divestiture of a business in the Industrial Technologies segment.\n(3) Includes certain non-recurring costs associated with commercial, operational and cost-reduction initiatives and costs associated with global ERP\nsystem integration efforts.

These benefit cost components are excluded from adjusted EBITDA since they are\nprimarily influenced by external market conditions that impact investment returns and interest (discount) rates. Curtailment gains and losses and\nsettlement gains and losses are excluded from adjusted EBITDA since they generally result from certain non-recurring events, such as plan\namendments to modify future benefits or settlements of plan obligations. The service cost and prior service cost components of pension and\npostretirement expense are included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA, since they are considered to be a better reflection of the ongoing service-\nrelated costs of providing these benefits.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal\npresentation. If anyone today should require operator assistance, please press star, zero from your\ntelephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Steve Nicola, Chief Financial Officer. Steve, you may begin.\nSteven Nicola, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Thank you, Rob. Good morning. I'm Steve Nicola,\nChief Financial Officer of Matthews, and with me today is Joe Bartolacci, our company's President and\nChief Executive Officer.\nBefore we start, I would like to remind you that our earnings release was posted on the Company's website\nwww.matw.com in the Investors section last night. The presentation for our call can also be accessed in\nthe Investors section of the website under Presentations.\nAny forward-looking statements in connection with this discussion are being made pursuant to the Safe\nHarbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Factors that could cause the\nCompany's results to differ from those discussed today are set forth in the Company's Annual Report on\nForm 10-K and other public filings with the SEC.\nIn addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial metrics and encourage you to read our disclosures\nand reconciliation tables carefully as you consider these metrics in connection with any forward-looking\nstatements and non-GAAP financial information. Please read the disclaimer included in today's\npresentation materials located on our website.\nNow, I will turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Bartolacci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Steve. Good morning.\nFiscal 2024 was a challenging year for several of our business units, driven by economic conditions and\nlegal events outside of our control. With that said, we were quite pleased with the performance of our larger\nbusinesses, Memorialization and SGK that continued to demonstrate the Company's resilience as well as\nour employees' commitment.\nOur Industrial Technologies segment continued to experience slow shipments and installations for our\nenergy storage products in addition to soft demand for warehouse solutions, though we do expect the\nmarket environment for warehouse solutions to improve in 2025.\nConsolidated sales and Adjusted EBITDA came in as expected, but lower on a year-over-year basis.\nOverall, we reported $447 million in consolidated sales in the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter compared to $480\nmillion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $58 million\nand in line with our expectations.\nFor the full year, we reported $1.8 billion in consolidated sales and met our revised guidance target of $205\nmillion of Adjusted EBITDA. Before providing a more detailed discussion of our business performance in\nthe quarter, let me touch on several of our key strategic priorities as we started fiscal 2024.\nAt SGK, our team had been contending with an extended period of softness in the European brand market\nin addition to regional regulatory changes that impacted comparability in the business. I'm pleased to see\nthe steady improvement in the business which has now stabilized and, in the fourth quarter, resulted in\nSGK reporting a third consecutive quarter of higher sequential sales and good margins. A steady diet of\ncost control, price improvements and growth in the APAC region have proven to be the cure. Additionally,\ntransitioning to an ecommerce digital marketing platform not only set us apart from our market peers, but\nalso led to an increase in revenues and organic business opportunities that position us well for 2025 and\nbeyond.\nMemorialization has been the bedrock of our company and continues to outperform despite the\nnormalization of casketed deaths post COVID. The business has benefited from pricing actions and several\nsmall tuck-in acquisitions while delivering on cremation and mausoleum-related products that we believe\nexemplifies the diversity of this segment. Cost control measures taken during the fiscal year also contributed\nto an improvement in operating margins.\nFor the fiscal year, the business reported $163 million in Adjusted EBITDA, compared to $146 million for\nthe fiscal year ending 2020 at the peak of the pandemic.\nNow let's move on to Industrial Technologies beginning with the Product Identification business, which\ncontinued to perform well. This business grew in the fourth quarter, benefiting from pricing actions taken\nearlier in the year. Given our current product mix, our sales in North America were quite strong, driven by\na strong construction market, a market where we have highly competitive offerings.\nWe came into the year fiercely determined to make inroads in bringing our new printed product, Axian, to\nmarket. I'm pleased with the progress that we've made here, and we are now preparing to launch the\nproduct in the latter half of fiscal 2025. Beta testing of the product has gone better than expected and we\nlook forward to sharing more details with you as we get closer to the product launch. In addition to the Axian\nproduct, we also launched a new line of lasers in the second half of the year and now have orders coming\nin and shipping has commenced.\nAs discussed on earlier calls, our Warehouse Automation business faced headwinds during the year as\ndemand fell due to customer uncertainty about the economy and higher interest rates. However, over the\nlast two quarters of the year, market sentiment began to shift and quoting activity picked up in volume and\nin size. Recently, there has been related news that some of the larger, well-known distribution networks\nwere starting to invest again, supporting our thesis of a return to a higher activity level for the automation\nmarket.\nWe also won orders from several new accounts in Europe, justifying our decision to expand our presence\nin that region. As a result, our outlook for fiscal 2025 is cautiously optimistic as we expect the demand\nrecovery to have a slow start, resulting in meaningful revenue impact sometime in the latter part of fiscal\n2025 and into 2026.\nFinally, let's talk about the Energy Solutions business where most of the attention has been directed over\nthe last few quarters. Most of you on this call are aware of Tesla's complaint against Matthews, filed in June\nof this year. The federal judge in that proceeding has ordered that the proper jurisdiction for the claims\nbegins in arbitration as required by the agreement between the parties.\nAs I have said before, Tesla's claims are meritless and have been filed in a public forum for the sole purpose\nof bringing pressure on us to relinquish our technology. Ironically, their claim, in our opinion, validates the\nrelevance and importance of our energy storage business due to the value they have ascribed to our\nsolutions – a value that has never been recognized by the market when assessing our consolidated\nvaluation. More industry players are now aware of our proprietary engineered solutions and the significant\ncost reduction benefits that can be derived by implementing them. Since the claim was filed, we have taken\n2\ncautious steps to offset any impact to our bottom line and, as a result, are now better positioned, both\nfinancially and operationally, to lead the ongoing transition to electric vehicles once this matter is resolved.\nWe have long been developing advanced calendaring solutions for next-gen equipment for both the lithium-\nion battery space as well as the hydrogen fuel cell space. As evidence of our continued innovation, we\nrecently received a U.S. patent directed to systems for manufacturing dry battery electrodes for energy\nstorage devices using our innovative calendaring technology. The newly issued patent stems from a patent\napplication that was filed in early 2019 and becomes a part of the significant intellectual property we have\ndeveloped in this space.\nOn a year-over-year basis, Energy business revenues were significantly down in the fourth quarter,\nreflecting the impact of slower-than-expected customer deliveries which continue but not as originally\nanticipated. We expect deliveries to be substantially completed in fiscal 2025.\nJust a quick word on our previously announced cost reduction program. It is now underway and, as a result,\nwe took some charges in the quarter, but we are overall quite satisfied with the outcome so far. We have\nexited less profitable operations and begun the process of selling the related assets which we expect to go\non throughout this year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet, in an ongoing effort to provide certainty around our financing earlier this\nyear, we renewed and extended our revolving credit facility through 2029. Recently, we also refinanced our\nsenior notes that were due to mature in December of next year. As part of our new senior notes, we\nstructured in a one-year call option that provides us significant flexibility to lower our cost of capital in the\nevent that interest rates continue to decrease and provides us flexibility to achieve our strategic goals. Also,\nas part of our ongoing focus on debt reduction, and despite the elevated levels of working capital related to\nour Energy Solutions business, we reduced our debt by over $50 million during the fourth quarter.\nWe enter the new fiscal year focused on continuing to identify ways to create value throughout all of our\nbusiness segments, including accretive tuck-in acquisitions and non-core divestitures that we believe will\ndrive stronger financial performance and cash generation. We expect another solid year of results in 2025\nfrom our Memorialization business and continued growth by the SGK segment. We also expect our Product\nIdentification business to benefit from the Axian launch as well as a full-year of results from the new laser\nproduct that was launched earlier this year. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect a strong recovery in our\nWarehouse Automation solutions business as the market picks up. Consequently, we are projecting\nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2025 to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million.\nFinally, in light of the long-term opportunities available to us in the Industrial Technologies segment, we\nrecently engaged J.P. Morgan to support us on a review of potential strategic alternatives.\nI will now turn the call over to Steve for more insight on our financial results.\nSteven Nicola: Thank you, Joe. For the financial review, let’s begin with Slide 7.\nFor the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, the Company reported a net loss of $68.2 million or $2.21 per share\ncompared to net income of $17.7 million or $0.56 per share a year ago. The loss for the current quarter\nresulted from charges in connection with the Company's previously announced cost reduction program, a\ngoodwill impairment charge, and other asset write-downs primarily related to our European businesses.\nOn a non-GAAP adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of these charges, net income attributable to\nthe company for the current quarter was $16.6 million or $0.55 per share, compared to $30.3 million or\n$0.96 per share last year. The decline primarily reflected the impacts of lower consolidated Adjusted\nEBITDA and higher interest expense for the current quarter.\n3\nConsolidated sales for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter were $446.7 million, compared to $480.2 million a year\nago. The decline primarily reflected lower sales for the Industrial Technologies segment, mainly reflecting\nlower Engineering sales. Additionally, sales for the Memorialization segment declined modestly for the\ncurrent quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to lower unit volumes principally related to a decrease\nin U.S. casketed deaths. These declines were partially offset by higher sales for the SGK Brand Solutions\nsegment, which is continuing to benefit from more stable market conditions.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter was $58.1 million compared to $61.9\nmillion a year ago. The decrease primarily reflected the decline in the Industrial Technologies segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Memorialization segment was higher than a year ago, and the SGK Brand\nSolutions segment was relatively unchanged. In addition, corporate and other nonoperating costs were\nlower than a year ago, primarily reflecting the Company's cost reduction efforts as we continue to leverage\nthe benefits of our global business services platform. Please see the reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA\nand non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share provided in our earnings release.\nPlease move to Slide 8 to review our segment results. Sales for the Memorialization segment for the fiscal\n2024 fourth quarter were $196.8 million, compared to $204.9 million for the same quarter a year ago. Sales\nvolumes for cemetery, memorials, caskets and cremation equipment were lower for the quarter compared\nto last year as U.S. casketed deaths declined. These declines were partially offset by the favorable impacts\nof improved price realization and higher mausoleum sales. Recent acquisitions also contributed to the\nsegment sales for the current quarter.\nMemorialization segment Adjusted EBITDA for the current quarter was $40.5 million, compared to $36.9\nmillion for the same quarter last year. The increase primarily resulted from improved pricing and benefits\nfrom cost savings initiatives. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower sales volumes\nand increased labor and material costs.\nPlease move to Slide 9. Sales for the SGK Brand Solutions segment were $135.9 million for the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, compared to $134.7 million a year ago, representing an increase of $1.2\nmillion. The increase primarily reflected higher sales for the merchandising and private label businesses,\ngrowth in the segment's Asia Pacific market, and improved price realization to mitigate inflationary cost\nincreases.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the SGK Brand Solutions segment was $17.3 million for the current quarter, which\nwas relatively consistent with the segment's Adjusted EBITDA of $17.5 million a year ago. The benefits of\nhigher sales and the segment's cost reduction actions were offset by higher labor-related costs and\nperformance-based compensation. The segment's year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA increased to $61.6\nmillion for fiscal 2024, compared to $57.1 million last year, primarily reflecting the benefits of the cost\nreduction actions resulting in year-over-year margin improvement.\nPlease move to Slide 10. Sales for the Industrial Technologies segment for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter\nwere $113.9 million, compared to $140.6 million a year ago. The decrease primarily resulted from lower\nsales for the segment's Engineering business, which, consistent with prior quarters this year, has been\nsignificantly impacted by customer delays in shipments and installations. The delays are timing in nature\nas we expect the shipments and installations to occur in fiscal 2025.\nAdditionally, operating results for our Warehouse Automation business have been unfavorably impacted by\nthe continued slow conditions in the U.S. warehouse industry. However, as reported last quarter, we\ncontinue to see signs of improvement based on recent quoting and order rates, which is expected to support\nrecovery in this business next year. Recent divestitures also contributed to the reported sales decrease for\nthe quarter for this segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Industrial Technologies segment for the current quarter was $15.9 million,\ncompared to $23.5 million a year ago. The decrease primarily reflected the impacts of the sales declines in\n4\nthe Engineering and Warehouse Automation businesses. The declines were partially offset by lower\nperformance-based compensation and the benefits of operational savings initiatives.\nPlease move to Slide 11. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter ended September 30, 2024,\nwas $35.9 million, compared to $2.6 million a year ago. The increase from a year ago primarily reflected\nthe cash flow benefit of working capital reductions. For the year ended September 30, 2024, cash flow from\noperations was $79.3 million, which was relatively consistent with operating cash flow of $79.5 million last\nyear.\nOutstanding debt was $776 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $830 million at the end of last\nquarter, representing a reduction of $53.8 million during the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter. The Company's net\ndebt, which represents outstanding debt less cash, was $736 million at September 30, 2024, compared to\n$787 million at June 30, 2024, representing a reduction of $51.8 million during the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter.\nSince the beginning of calendar 2024, the Company has reduced its outstanding debt and net debt balances\nby $86 million and $89 million, respectively. During the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, the Company reduced its\nnet debt leverage ratio from 3.8 at June 30, 2024, to 3.6 at September 30, 2024. This leverage ratio is\nbased on net debt and trailing 12-month Adjusted EBITDA.\nIn addition, in September 2024, we completed the refinancing of the outstanding senior notes, which were\ndue December 1, 2025. Due to current interest rates and the ongoing strategic review of our business\nportfolio, we opted for a shorter-term bond three-year maturity with an ability to call in one year.\nFor the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, the Company purchased only approximately 2,000 shares under the\nstock repurchase program, which was solely in connection with withholding tax obligations on equity\ncompensation vesting. As evidenced by our debt reduction during this quarter, we remain primarily focused\non debt reduction. Approximately 30.6 million shares were outstanding at September 30, 2024.\nAs I noted in the beginning of my remarks, we have initiated cost reduction programs this quarter that span\nseveral of our business units and corporate functions. These programs are expected to result in annual\ncost savings up to $50 million with the most significant portions from our engineering and tooling operations\nin Europe and also targeting our general and administrative costs.\nFinally, the Board this week declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share on the Company's common\nstock. This represents the 31st consecutive annual dividend increase since becoming a publicly traded\ncompany. The dividend is payable December 16, 2024, to stockholders of record December 2, 2024.\nThis concludes the financial review and we will now open the call for any questions.\nOperator\nThank you. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question\ntoday, please press star, one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the\nquestion queue. You may press star, two if you would like to withdraw your question from the queue. For\nparticipants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star\nkeys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Thank you.\nThank you and our first question is from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed with\nyour question.\nDaniel Moore, CJS Securities: Thank you. Good morning, Joe and good morning, Steve. Thanks for taking\nmy questions.\nJoseph Bartolacci: Good morning, Dan.\n5\nDaniel Moore: I’ll start with Energy Storage and maybe just refresh on what level of backlog entering fiscal\n'25, and maybe just talk to the cadence of the opportunity set over the next several quarters, both with your\nlarge customer and some of the emerging customers. Assuming most of that backlog ships, when do we\nneed to start to put more orders into backlog to return to growth, say, maybe in fiscal '26 and beyond?\nJoseph Bartolacci: Yes, Dan. Our backlog is about $100 million, a little less than that, that will mostly be\ndelivered over the course of the next 12 months. As it relates to other opportunities, as you might expect,\nwe are being cautious with some of that at this point in time. There is no lack of interest, I can assure you\nof that. But given where we stand with the dispute, we are in the midst of evaluating what we can and\ncannot do at this time.\nDaniel Moore: Makes perfect sense. Then just to the guide more generally, maybe just talk about what's\nembedded for Industrial Technology. You just described, I think, the Energy Storage well. In terms of\nWarehouse Automation, do you expect orders to improve? And in terms of Axian, what's implied there in\nterms of revenue for maybe the back half of fiscal '25?\nJoseph Bartolacci: Sure. Let's be as clear as we can. As you all know, when we talk about the Warehouse\nAutomation business, it is a business that in our initial first quarter is generally low. I mean, we are out of\nwarehouses during that time period. It's the Christmas season, so we are expecting a slower first quarter\nof 2025. However, quoting activity that we're seeing right now bodes for a stronger year in 2025 and beyond,\ngiven the size and the volume activity that we're seeing.\nWe saw growth in our Product Identification business this year. We will continue to see growth next year.\nAs I said in my comments with regard to the launch of our Axian product, do not expect it to be a\nskyrocketing launch, but customer acceptance is going to be the greatest acknowledgment of what we think\nthe future of that product will be. Our beta testing has gone exceedingly well and we're seeing a confirmation\nof all the value propositions we expect out of that. I think it's going to be a significant contributor to us going\nforward.\nMore importantly, I would say, Dan, the opportunities that are available to us because of that technology—\nbeyond what we do today—whether it be in the form of licensing or whether it be in the form of\nadvancements we want to carry forward, are significant. When we speak of opportunities in our Industrial\nTechnologies segment, our Product Identification, our Warehouse, including our Energy business, are keys\nto what we see the future of the business to be.\nDaniel Moore: Excellent. I'm sure you're a little bit limited, but one of the more interesting comments in the\npress release, exploring strategies with respect to the portfolio. Can you elaborate on what options you're\ncontemplating? What sort of might be on or off the table from a strategic high-level perspective?\nJoseph Bartolacci: Sure, Dan. As you might expect, we're not going to talk too much about that process\nuntil it's concluded. However, we have been pretty clear. As we start to see some of our smaller businesses\nhave access to greater opportunities for growth—and I'm speaking of the three businesses in our Industrial\nTechnologies segment—we would evaluate our portfolio. We are now at that point where we see that\nopportunity, given what we're seeing in our Energy business, which has significant opportunities, our\nWarehouse Automation business with add-ons that we can make through acquisitions in that space, and\nthe launch of Axian and our new product in the laser space, we see those now beginning to see the\nopportunity that we had always hoped for.\nWe're evaluating the whole portfolio, looking for where is the best way to maximize shareholder value. I'm\nnot going to speak about any part of it, but it's consistent with what we've said publicly for a while.\nDaniel Moore: Understood. I’ll jump back with any follow-ups. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Joe.\n6\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Liam Burke with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with\nyour questions.\nLiam Burke, B. Riley Securities: Thank you. Good morning, Joe. Good morning, Steve.\nJoseph Bartolucci: Hi Liam.\nSteven Nicola: Hey Liam.\nLiam Burke: Joe, could you give us a little more detail on the Memorialization side, both on the\nMemorialization products, understanding traditional burials are down, so caskets naturally should be down.\nBut are memorialization products, both bronze and granite getting any lift from increased cremations? What\ndid that business look like this quarter?\nJoseph Bartolacci: I would tell you, Liam, what I said in my comments with respect to the diversity of the\nportfolio, I think it is probably the most misunderstood part of that business. It's not just a casket and a\nmemorial market. When we sell, whether it be cremation-related products, which are now over $120 million\nat this point in time or whether—actually, Steve just corrected me, it's $140 million, excuse me—and\nwhether or not it would be mausoleum constructions that are going quite strong and quite well for us right\nnow, the diversity of the portfolio is what's giving the opportunity.\nSecondly, we continue to see opportunities for tuck-ins in that business to continue to grow it at very\nfavorable return on the kind of investments that we can make. I would tell you that what we're seeing is the\ngrowth of our cremation business is related to all of the Memorialization segment, whether it be bronze,\nwhether it be stone, whether it be our installations in our mausoleum business or whether it be other related\nproduct. We don't view this as a business that is materially declining in any sort.\nLiam Burke: Okay. I mean, you're generating nice EBITDA margins there. I mean high teens, you took\nover the 20s this quarter. Is there a point where this crossover would actually allow you to show some\norganic growth outside of acquisitions?\nJoseph Bartolacci: Yes, I would say so, Liam. I want to tell you mostly that's going to be driven by price,\nbut absolutely. We're seeing that in our cremation. We're seeing organic growth in our cremation at this\npoint in time. As the public starts to acknowledge the need for memorialization of cremated remains, we\nthink that 140 continues to grow, and could ultimately show us modest top line growth, coupled with our\nprice increases throughout. We think this is a great business.\nI think the other thing you didn't touch on, I would tell you, is the cash flow generated from this business.\nThis business this year generated wonderful cash flow as we focused on receivable collection and just\nconverting our inventory management. When we look at a business that's generating $160-plus million of\nEBITDA with a CapEx that is about $20 million, this is a business that generates exceptional cash flow.\nLiam Burke: Great. Thank you, Joe.\nOperator: Our next questions are from the line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli Funds. Please proceed with\nyour questions.\nJustin Bergner, Gabelli Funds: Good morning, Joe. Good morning, Steve.\nJoseph Bartolacci: Good morning.\nJustin Bergner: A couple of questions here. On the strategic review, was there a trigger for why you're\ngetting this underway now, and is this more focused on the Industrial Technology businesses or on some\nof the legacy businesses?\n7\nJoseph Bartolacci: Justin, we're not going to comment about what businesses it may be. What triggered\nit now, frankly, is the exceptional opportunities in front of us that are now coming to fruition in industrial tech.\nWhether it be the energy business, which received great confirmation through the dispute that we are\nhaving right now. Customers around the world are contacting us at this point to kind of get access to that\nopportunity. As I said, we're cautious with respect to what we do today until this dispute is resolved, but\nsignificant opportunities are there. When we look at finally getting to the launch of our Axian product with a\nclear pathway to getting there, we see that as an opportunity to continue to grow the business in a more\nfast way than we have been historically. And Warehouse, we see significant opportunity to add tuck-ins to\nexpand our portfolio. We have a very, very, very unique opportunity in that business that is misunderstood\nor undervalued by the market. We are looking at the portfolio consistently, as we have discussed, that when\nwe saw these smaller businesses start to achieve a pathway to growth of significance, we would evaluate\nthe portfolio.\nJustin Bergner: Got it. Thank you. On the $50 million of savings, what's the cadence for the realization of\nthose savings over the course of the current fiscal year and into 2026 fiscal year? What will be the total\ncash costs required to generate the $50 million of savings?\nSteven Nicola: Justin, with respect to the savings, we're expecting to realize somewhere in the $25 million\nto $30 million of that to get to that run rate by the end of this year, and then with the remainder to get to the\nrun rate by the end of next fiscal year. That would be the cadence. And obviously, that timing is just based\non our ability to affect some of the change.\nWith respect to the cost of that, if I exclude the goodwill impairment and just some of the recent asset write-\ndowns, the total cost to achieve that are somewhere in the $40 million range, $30 million to $40 million\nrange, and about 75% of that is cash, 25% noncash.\nJoseph Bartolacci: One thing I'd add to that, Justin, is the costs that we've accrued at this point in time do\nnot include the anticipated inflow of cash from the sale of related assets, which will materially reduce the\ncosts to achieve.\nJustin Bergner: Got you. All right. Then lastly, you mentioned a new patent on the energy storage side. It\ncame at me a bit fast. Could you just clarify sort of what that is and what it allows for the business?\nJoseph Bartolacci: Could you repeat that question very quickly for me?\nJustin Bergner: Sorry. Yes, I think in your prepared remarks, you indicated a new patent in the energy\nstorage business. Could you review what that is and how it amplifies the opportunities?\nJoseph Bartolacci: Sure. I mean it's what we've said all along, Justin. We've been working on this in the\ndry battery electrode space for better than a decade. The patent is a critical piece of equipment process in\nthe whole production of dry battery electrode filed in early 2019 before we had done any work for any EV\nor battery manufacturers at that time. So, it is evidence of our long-standing experience in specialty\ncalendaring and, frankly, a great asset to the portfolio.\nJustin Bergner: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your\nquestions.\nColin Rusch, Oppenheimer: Thanks so much, guys. Given the election results and some of the activity\nthat we're seeing in the battery space around folks trying to derisk supply chains and move into non-China\ngeographies, can you characterize a little bit of where you're at with the non-Tesla customers in terms of\n8\nconversations, maturity, pressure to accelerate timeframes on the dry electrode process into higher-cost\nregions where you guys can provide a great deal of value?\nJoseph Bartolacci: Yes. Well, there's a lot in that question, Colin. Let's see if I can parse it out. First off, I\nmean, with regard to the geopolitics of the current administration, I think part of the issue that is most\nmisunderstood about our business is that we are probably the only Western world company able to do what\nwe're doing right now and that has put us in a unique position to be able to service the Western world\nmarkets that others may not.\nThe other question is as it relates to other customers, as I said, we are being quite cautious with respect to\nspeaking and pushing anything with our other customers, given the current dispute. We hope to have more\nclarity on that dispute in early January that will allow us to be more frank about our conversations and where\nwe stand with that.\nI'm trying to piece out the rest of that question, I can't remember what else you said. I'm sorry, I should...\nColin Rusch: That gets after it. I appreciate it. The other question for me is just really around the product\nidentification and the new products there. Can you give us a sense of early returns on that now that you're\nshipping a few things to get a sense of the cadence of the uptake on those new products as you get into\n2025?\nJoseph Bartolacci: When it comes to the laser product we just put into market, it is margins that are\nconsistent with the overall portfolio, which would be margins, I would say, in the high teens, which was\nexactly where we expected it to be. We expect the margin in our Axian product to continue to grow. This is\na unique proposition with the opportunity to reduce total cost of ownership for our customers by up to 30%\nduring the lifetime of the product; we expect to capture some of that benefit. As we get market share and\nas it gets acceptance, we think this will be a significant contributor to our bottom line.\nColin Rusch: That's helpful. But I'm curious about the cadence of uptake, right? (Cross-talking) I'm thinking\nabout top line (inaudible).\nJoseph Bartolacci: I don't expect significant dollars next year, but I think it's going to be, as I said, more\nabout customer adoption. As you might expect, a large soda bottling company is not going to convert to a\nnew technology overnight, but as they adopt and accept it, I'll be able to speak more clearly about that. We\nthink it will be a bigger contributor in 2026 than it will be in 2025. Then there are other uses—let's call it\nthat—for the product. We're starting to see activity in that are things beyond what we do with licensing with\nothers. There's a great opportunity there that we'll talk more about as we start to get closer to launch.\nColin Rusch: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Daniel Moore with CJS Securities.\nPlease proceed with your questions.\nDaniel Moore: Thanks again. Appreciate it. I think one of the interesting things that maybe gets less\nattention, SGK turning positive is pretty significant. Maybe just talk to your confidence in the sustainability\nof that top line growth. What's driving it? What's changed in your end markets, and what's kind of the outlook\nfor '25/26?\nJoseph Bartolacci: That's a great question, Dan. We've talked about it pretty extensively. For anybody\nthat operates in the consumer goods business in Europe, we still continue to struggle in that part of the\nworld. What we're seeing, however, is as we said, our digital ecommerce solutions continue to grow,\nparticularly in North America and the APAC region. Our unique position in particularly the APAC region,\nwhere the competition is less present has given us opportunities there that are going to allow us to continue\nto grow.\n9\nBut I would tell you the most important thing that has allowed us to kind of achieve these results is the fact\nthat as we kind of move forward, our unique opportunities and our service to our customers has allowed us\nto raise prices in an industry that has not been known for that for the last decade. We've been lowering\nprices year after year after year until we significantly pushed back to cover the cost of our inflationary\nimpact. Those inflationary price increases has allowed us at least to maintain where we are and not worry\nabout when we add a new account or when we add a new project. When we add new markets, those\nactually drop to the bottom line. We see that finally turning the tide to where our inflationary price increases\ngive us stability and new wins actually come to the bottom line. I think that's a pathway forward for that\nbusiness.\nDaniel Moore: Really helpful. Steve, any more quantification that you can give us just in terms of, or even\nrank ordering the buckets of cost savings for that $50 million across business lines, as well as what's in sort\nof corporate G&A?\nSteven Nicola: I would say this, Dan. The predominant number of more than half of the savings are\nexpected to come from our European operations, and then the balance will be over, I'd say multiple\nbusinesses, the remaining businesses, but a good portion coming from our G&A line.\nDaniel Moore: Got it. Last one for me. You're projecting higher operating cash flow next year. I think you\nsaid can you quantify that more?\nSteven Nicola: We are.\nDaniel Moore: Any quantification and what are we thinking about in terms of CapEx for '25? Thanks again.\nSteven Nicola: I'll start with the CapEx. Our expected CapEx range next year is going to be in the $50\nmillion to $60 million range on a consolidated basis. That's our current projection. It will be a little bit difficult\nto quantify the cash flow just simply because of the working capital component of the cash flow, and that's\ngoing to be dependent on some of the timing of the energy deliveries and shipments, but still should be\nfavorable.\nDaniel Moore: Understood. Thanks again.\nSteven Nicola: You’re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. As there are no additional questions, Steve, I'll turn the floor back to you for closing\nremarks.\nSteven Nicola: Thank you, Rob. We appreciate everyone's participation in the call this morning. Have a\ngood day and a great weekend.\nOperator: This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank\nyou for your participation\n10"

Nicola\nChief Financial Officer\nDISCLAIMER\nAny forward-looking statements contained in this presentation are included pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements\nregarding the expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies of the Company regarding the future, and may be identified by the use of words such as “expects,” “believes,” “intends,” “projects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “plans,” “seeks,”\n“forecasts,” “predicts,” “objective,” “targets,” “potential,” “outlook,” “may,” “will,” “could” or the negative of these terms, other comparable terminology and variations thereof. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and\nuncertainties that may cause the Company’s actual results in future periods to be materially different from management’s expectations, and no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove correct. Factors that could cause the Company's\nresults to differ materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements principally include changes in domestic or international economic conditions, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates, changes in\nthe cost of materials used in the manufacture of the Company's products, any impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, environmental liability and limitations on the Company’s operations due to environmental laws and regulations, disruptions to\ncertain services, such as telecommunications, network server maintenance, cloud computing or transaction processing services, provided to the Company by third-parties, changes in mortality and cremation rates, changes in product demand or\npricing as a result of consolidation in the industries in which the Company operates, or other factors such as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages or labor cost increases, changes in product demand or pricing as a result of domestic or\ninternational competitive pressures, ability to achieve cost-reduction objectives, unknown risks in connection with the Company's acquisitions and divestitures, cybersecurity concerns and costs arising with management of cybersecurity threats,\neffectiveness of the Company's internal controls, compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, technological factors beyond the Company's control, impact of pandemics or similar outbreaks, or other disruptions to our industries,\ncustomers, or supply chains, the impact of global conflicts, such as the current war between Russia and Ukraine, the outcome of the Company's dispute with Tesla, Inc. (\"Tesla\"), and other factors described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form\n10-K and other periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIncluded in this report are measures of financial performance that are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing its performance on\na consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company’s core operations including acquisition and divestiture costs, ERP integration costs,\nstrategic initiative and other charges (which includes non-recurring charges related to certain commercial and operational initiatives and exit activities), stock-based compensation and the non-service portion of pension and postretirement expense.\nManagement believes that presenting non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items that management\nbelieves do not directly reflect the Company’s core operations, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, forecast, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance,\nand (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s results. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the\ncorresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provided herein, provides investors with an additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company’s business that could not be obtained absent\nthese disclosures.\nThe Company believes that adjusted EBITDA provides relevant and useful information, which is used by the Company’s management in assessing the performance of its business. Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as earnings before\ninterest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain non-cash and/or non-recurring items that do not contribute directly to management’s evaluation of its operating results. These items include stock-based compensation, the non-service\nportion of pension and postretirement expense, acquisition and divestiture costs, ERP integration costs, and strategic initiatives and other charges. Adjusted EBITDA provides the Company with an understanding of earnings before the impact of\ninvesting and financing charges and income taxes, and the effects of certain acquisition and divestiture and ERP integration costs, and items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of the Company’s operations. This measure may be useful to an\ninvestor in evaluating operating performance. It is also useful as a financial measure for lenders and is used by the Company’s management to measure business performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of the Company's financial\nperformance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the Company's\nliquidity. The Company's definition of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nThe Company has presented constant currency sales and constant currency adjusted EBITDA and believes these measures provide relevant and useful information, which is used by the Company's management in assessing the performance of its\nbusiness on a consistent basis by removing the impact of changes due to foreign exchange translation rates. These measures allow management, as well as investors, to assess the Company’s sales and adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency\nbasis.\nThe Company has also presented adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share and believes each measure provides relevant and useful information, which is widely used by analysts and investors, as well as by the Company’s management\nin assessing the performance of its business. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share provides the Company with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of certain acquisition,\ndivestiture, and system-integration costs, and items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations. These measures provide management with insight into the earning value for shareholders excluding certain costs, not related to the\nCompany’s primary operations. Likewise, these measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying operating performance of the Company’s business overall, as well as performance trends, on a consistent basis.\nLastly, the Company has presented net debt and a net debt leverage ratio and believes each measure provides relevant and useful information, which is widely used by analysts and investors as well as by our management. These measures provide\nmanagement with insight on the indebtedness of the Company, net of cash and cash equivalents and relative to adjusted EBITDA. These measures allow management, as well as analysts and investors, to assess the Company’s leverage.\n© 2024 Matthews International Corporation.

All Rights Reserved. 11\nSUPPLEMENTAL\nINFORMATION\nRECONCILIATIONS OF\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIncluded in this report are measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP, including, without limitation, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted\nnet income and EPS, constant currency sales, constant currency adjusted EBITDA, and net debt and net debt leverage ratio. The Company defines net\ndebt leverage ratio as outstanding debt (net of cash) relative to adjusted EBITDA. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures to assist in\ncomparing its performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management\nbelieves do not directly reflect the Company’s core operations including acquisition and divestiture costs, ERP integration costs, strategic initiative\nand other charges (which includes non-recurring charges related to operational initiatives and exit activities), stock-based compensation and the non-\nservice portion of pension and postretirement expense. Constant currency sales and constant currency adjusted EBITDA removes the impact of\nchanges due to foreign exchange translation rates. To calculate sales and adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis, amounts for periods in the\ncurrent fiscal year are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates applicable to the comparable periods of the prior fiscal year. Management\nbelieves that presenting non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental\ninformation regarding financial performance by excluding certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's core\noperations, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, forecast, make operating and strategic\ndecisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the\nCompany’s results. The Company's calculations of its non-GAAP financial measures, however, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures\nreported by other companies. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the\ncorresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provided herein, provide investors with an additional\nunderstanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company’s business that could not be obtained absent these disclosures.\n© 2024 Matthews International Corporation.

Fiscal 2024 also includes legal costs related to an ongoing dispute with Tesla, which totaled $4,261 and $12,399\nfor the three months and fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Fiscal 2023 includes loss recoveries totaling $2,154 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, which were related to a previously disclosed theft of funds by a former employee initially identified in fiscal\n2015.\n(4) Represents exchange gains and losses associated with highly inflationary accounting related to the Company's Turkish subsidiaries.\n(5) Fiscal 2024 includes goodwill write-downs within the Industrial Technologies segment of $16,727, asset write-downs within the Memorialization segment of $13,716, and investment write-downs within Corporate and Non-operating of $3,131.\n(6) Non-service pension and postretirement expense includes interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses, curtailment gains and losses, and settlement gains and losses. These benefit cost components are excluded from adjusted EBITDA\nsince they are primarily influenced by external market conditions that impact investment returns and interest (discount) rates. Curtailment gains and losses and settlement gains and losses are excluded from adjusted EBITDA since they generally result from certain non-recurring\nevents, such as plan amendments to modify future benefits or settlements of plan obligations. The service cost and prior service cost components of pension and postretirement expense are included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA, since they are considered to be a better\nreflection of the ongoing service-related costs of providing these benefits. Please note that GAAP pension and postretirement expense or the adjustment above are not necessarily indicative of the current or future cash flow requirements related to these employee benefit plans.\n* Depreciation and amortization was $7,368 and $6,646 for the Memorialization segment, $6,028 and $5,600 for the Industrial Technologies segment, $9,724 and $11,299 for the SGK Brand Solutions segment, and $1,209 and $1,172 for Corporate and Non-Operating, for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The difference between the Company’s income tax rates on adjusted net income for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was primarily caused by the foreign net operating losses with full valuation allowances and nondeductible goodwill\nimpairment charges in the current fiscal year.\n(1) Includes certain non-recurring costs associated with recent acquisition and divestiture activities, and also includes a gain in fiscal year 2023 related to the divestiture of a business in the Industrial Technologies segment.\n(2) Includes certain non-recurring costs associated with commercial, operational and cost-reduction initiatives, and costs associated with global ERP system integration efforts. Fiscal 2024 also includes legal costs related to an ongoing dispute with Tesla, which totaled\n$4,261 and $12,399 for the three months and fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Fiscal 2023 includes loss recoveries totaling $2,154 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, which were related to a previously disclosed theft of funds by a former\nemployee initially identified in fiscal 2015.\n(3) Represents exchange gains and losses associated with highly inflationary accounting related to the Company's Turkish subsidiaries\n(4) Fiscal 2024 includes goodwill write-downs within the Industrial Technologies segment, asset write-downs within the Memorialization segment, and investment write-downs within Corporate and Non-operating.\n(5) Non-service pension and postretirement expense includes interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses, curtailment gains and losses, and settlement gains and losses. These benefit cost components are excluded from\nadjusted EBITDA since they are primarily influenced by external market conditions that impact investment returns and interest (discount) rates. Curtailment gains and losses and settlement gains and losses are excluded from adjusted EBITDA since they generally\nresult from certain non-recurring events, such as plan amendments to modify future benefits or settlements of plan obligations. The service cost and prior service cost components of pension and postretirement expense are included in the calculation of adjusted\nEBITDA, since they are considered to be a better reflection of the ongoing service-related costs of providing these benefits. Please note that GAAP pension and postretirement expense or the adjustment above are not necessarily indicative of the current or future cash\nflow requirements related to these employee benefit plans.\n(6) The three months and fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 includes $2,703 of tax-related items incurred in connection with restructuring that resulted in a deferred tax asset write-off. Fiscal 2024 includes $136 of tax-related items incurred in connection with the\nderecognition of deferred tax assets for a joint venture that is being terminated.\n* Per share amounts based on the diluted shares for each respective period.\n* See Disclaimer (page 2) for Management’s assessment of supplemental information related to adjusted net income and adjusted EPS.\n© 2024 Matthews International Corporation.

Bartolacci, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated:\n\n“Our consolidated operating results for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter reflected another quarter of solid performance by our core businesses and, consistent with prior quarters, was impacted by continuing customer delays in our energy business. Our previously announced cost reduction program is now underway, as evidenced by the charges reflected in our GAAP results this quarter, and progressing well. Overall, we were pleased with the consolidated operating results as we again demonstrated the resilience of Matthews and our employees in mitigating the challenges faced by one of our segments. For the year ended September 30, 2024, consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $205.2 million.\n\n“The Memorialization segment reported higher adjusted EBITDA for the current quarter despite lower unit volumes, which were related to a decline in U.S. deaths compared to a year ago. Ongoing cost control efforts combined with improved price realization were the key drivers in the improvement in operating margins. This segment has done a tremendous job of maintaining its level of performance over the past several years despite the declines in unit volume following the pandemic.\n\n“We are also pleased to report that our SGK Brand Solutions segment reported another consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth. This segment has stabilized nicely over the last two years with modest improvements in margins and is continuing its recovery following the global impacts of the pandemic and the European impact of the Russia-Ukraine war. Sales for the segment increased compared to a year ago primarily reflecting improved pricing to mitigate inflationary cost increases, higher sales for the merchandising and private label businesses, and growth in the Asia-Pacific market.\n\n“Sales for the Industrial Technologies segment for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter declined from a year ago primarily resulting from further customer delays in our energy business. The current quarter also reflected a continued soft warehouse automation market; however, order rates have been improving recently which could bode well for a good recovery next fiscal year.\n\n“With respect to our cost reduction program, current quarter charges include non-cash goodwill impairment and other asset write-downs primarily in connection with our European operations, in addition to severance and other costs. The program is also targeting general and administrative cost reductions. For our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, we reported another quarter of lower corporate and non-operating costs compared to a year ago. For the year, corporate and non-operating costs were approximately 5% lower than last year.\n\n“During the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, we reduced our outstanding debt by $53.8 million. In addition, we completed the refinancing of outstanding senior notes due December 1, 2025. Due to current interest rates and the ongoing strategic review of our business portfolio, we opted for a shorter-term bond (three-year maturity) with an ability to call in one year. We are projecting higher operating cash flow next year as our working capital investments in fiscal 2024 begin to convert to operating cash flow, which will be partially mitigated by costs in connection with our cost reduction program.\n\n“Looking forward to fiscal 2025, we continue to face the uncertainty of project timing in our Industrial Technologies segment, specifically relating to our energy business. While we currently expect deliveries to be substantially completed during the year, quarterly timing is still difficult to forecast. Our cost reduction programs should mitigate some of this impact.\n\n“We expect another solid performance for our Memorialization business in fiscal 2025 as U.S. deaths appear to have generally normalized following COVID and we are projecting continued growth in our cremation-related products sales. Continued growth is also projected for our SGK Brand Solutions segment reflecting ongoing improvement in U.S. market conditions, more stable conditions in Europe, and further growth in the Asia-Pacific region. In the Industrial Technologies segment, our product identification business is projecting growth next year and we should start to realize benefits from the launch of a new printhead product, which is currently scheduled for the latter half of the fiscal year. Also, as noted earlier, recent improving order rates for warehouse automation solutions should support recovery in this business. With these considerations in mind, we remain cautious and are projecting adjusted EBITDA in the range of $205 million to $215 million for fiscal 2025.\n\n“Lastly, as growth opportunities for the Industrial Technologies segment continue to emerge, the Company has been exploring strategies with respect to its portfolio of businesses. Accordingly, we have retained J.P. Morgan to support the evaluation of potential strategic alternatives.”\n\n**Fourth Quarter Fiscal****2024****Consolidated Results (Unaudited)**\n\n_($ in millions, except per share data)_ | **Q4 FY2024** | **Q4 FY2023** | **Change** | **% Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nSales | $ | 446.7 | $ | 480.2 | $ | (33.5 | ) | (7.0)%  \nNet (loss) income attributable to Matthews | $ | (68.2 | ) | $ | 17.7 | $ | (85.9 | ) | NM  \nDiluted (loss) earnings per share | $ | (2.21 | ) | $ | 0.56 | $ | (2.77 | ) | NM  \nNon-GAAP adjusted net income | $ | 16.6 | $ | 30.3 | $ | (13.7 | ) | (45.2)%  \nNon-GAAP adjusted EPS | $ | 0.55 | $ | 0.96 | $ | (0.41 | ) | NM  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 58.1 | $ | 61.9 | $ | (3.8 | ) | (6.1)%  \n_Note: See the attached tables for additional important disclosures regarding Matthews’ use of non-GAAP measures as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures._  \n  \nConsolidated sales for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter were $446.7 million, compared to $480.2 million for the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, representing a decrease of $33.5 million.

On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, earnings for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter were $0.55 per share, compared to $0.96 per share a year ago. The net loss on a GAAP basis in the current fiscal quarter primarily reflected asset write-downs, including a goodwill impairment charge, and charges in connection with cost reduction programs. Adjusted EBITDA (net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other adjustments) for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter was $58.1 million, compared to $61.9 million a year ago, primarily reflecting lower adjusted EBITDA in the Industrial Technologies segment.\n\n**Fiscal****2024****Consolidated Results (Unaudited)**\n\n_($ in millions, except per share data)_ | **YTD FY2024** | **YTD FY2023** | **Change** | **% Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nSales | $ | 1,795.7 | $ | 1,880.9 | $ | (85.2 | ) | (4.5)%  \nNet (loss) income attributable to Matthews | $ | (59.7 | ) | $ | 39.3 | $ | (99.0 | ) | NM  \nDiluted (loss) earnings per share | $ | (1.93 | ) | $ | 1.26 | $ | (3.19 | ) | NM  \nNon-GAAP adjusted net income | $ | 67.0 | $ | 90.1 | $ | (23.1 | ) | (25.6)%  \nNon-GAAP adjusted EPS | $ | 2.17 | $ | 2.88 | $ | (0.71 | ) | (24.7)%  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 205.2 | $ | 225.8 | $ | (20.6 | ) | (9.1)%  \n_Note: See the attached tables for additional important disclosures regarding Matthews’ use of non-GAAP measures as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures._  \n  \nConsolidated sales for the year ended September 30, 2024 were $1.80 billion, compared to $1.88 billion a year ago, representing a decrease of $85.2 million, or 4.5%, from the prior year. Net loss attributable to the Company for the year ended September 30, 2024 was $59.7 million ($1.93 per share), compared to net income of $39.3 million ($1.26 per share) for fiscal 2023. On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, earnings for the year ended September 30, 2024 were $2.17 per share, compared to $2.88 per share last year. The net loss on a GAAP basis for the current fiscal year primarily resulted from asset write-downs, including a goodwill impairment charge, and charges in connection with cost reduction programs. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended September 30, 2024, was $205.2 million, compared to $225.8 million a year ago. The decrease reflected lower adjusted EBITDA for the Industrial Technologies and Memorialization segments, offset partially by higher adjusted EBITDA for SGK Brand Solutions and lower corporate and other non-operating costs.\n\n**Webcast**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast on Friday, November 22, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time to review its financial and operating results and discuss its corporate strategies and outlook.

limitation, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and EPS, constant currency sales, constant currency adjusted EBITDA, net debt and net debt leverage ratio. The Company defines net debt leverage ratio as outstanding debt (net of cash) relative to adjusted EBITDA. The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing its performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company’s core operations including acquisition and divestiture costs, ERP integration costs, strategic initiative and other charges (which includes non-recurring charges related to certain commercial and operational initiatives and exit activities), stock-based compensation and the non-service portion of pension and postretirement expense. Constant currency sales and constant currency adjusted EBITDA remove the impact of changes due to foreign exchange translation rates. To calculate sales and adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis, amounts for periods in the current fiscal year are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates applicable to the comparable periods of the prior fiscal year. Management believes that presenting non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's core operations, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, forecast, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s results. The Company's calculations of its non-GAAP financial measures, however, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provided herein, provide investors with an additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company’s business that could not be obtained absent these disclosures.\n\n**ADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION (Unaudited)****(In thousands)**  \n---  \n**Three Months EndedSeptember 30,** |  **Year Ended****September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**Net (loss) income** | **$** | **(68,161** | **)** | **$** | **17,693** | **$** | **(59,660** | **)** | **$** | **39,136**  \nIncome tax provision (benefit) | 680 | (2,362 | ) | (9,997 | ) | 1,774  \n**(Loss) income before income taxes** | **$** | **(67,481** | **)** | **$** | **15,331** | **$** | **(69,657** | **)** | **$** | **40,910**  \nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests | — | 30 | — | 155  \nInterest expense, including RPA and factory financing fees(1) | 14,825 | 12,746 | 55,364 | 48,690  \nDepreciation and amortization* | 24,329 | 24,717 | 94,770 | 96,530  \nAcquisition and divestiture related items(2) ** | 11 | 848 | 5,576 | 5,293  \nStrategic initiatives and other charges(3) **† | 48,458 | 6,168 | 65,586 | 13,923  \nHighly inflationary accounting impacts (primarily non-cash)(4) | 132 | (1,714 | ) | 1,027 | 1,360  \nGoodwill and asset write-downs(5) | 33,574 | — | 33,574 | —  \nStock-based compensation | 4,169 | 3,673 | 18,478 | 17,308  \nNon-service pension and postretirement expense(6) | 112 | 84 | 439 | 1,640  \n**Total Adjusted EBITDA** | **$** | **58,129** | **$** | **61,883** | **$** | **205,157** | **$** | **225,809**  \n_Adjusted EBITDA margin_ | _13.0_ | _%_ | _12.9_ | _%_ | _11.4_ | _%_ | _12.0_ | _%_  \n_(1)__Includes fees for receivables sold under the RPA and factoring arrangements totaling_ _$1,192_ _and_ _$1,284_ _for the three months ended September 30,__2024_ _and_ _2023_ _, respectively, and_ _$4,830_ _and_ _$4,042_ _for the fiscal years ended September 30,__2024_ _and_ _2023_ _, respectively._  \n_(2)__Includes certain non-recurring costs associated with recent acquisition and divestiture activities, and also includes a gain of_ _$1,827_ _for the three months and fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 related to the divestiture of a business in the Industrial Technologies segment._  \n_(3)__Includes certain non-recurring costs associated with commercial, operational and cost-reduction initiatives and costs associated with global ERP system integration efforts.
