ORGANIZATION, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nOrganization and Business Description\nWrap Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”), is a publicly traded company with its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share\n(“Common Stock”), listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the trading symbol “WRAP”. The Company is a developer and supplier of public safety products\nand training services for law enforcement and security personnel. The Company’s primary product is the BolaWrap® remote restraint device. The principal markets for the\nCompany’s proprietary products and services are in North and South America, Europe, Middle East and Asia.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company’s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and\nArticle 8 of Regulation S-X and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally\nincluded in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such\nrules and regulations. In management’s opinion, the accompanying financial statements reflect adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of\noperations, and cash flows for those periods indicated, and contain adequate disclosure to make the information presented not misleading. Adjustments included herein are\nof a normal, recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed in the footnotes. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction\nwith the Company’s audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 (the “Annual Report”), as filed with the SEC on August 28, 2024. The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December\n31, 2023 has been derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, contained in the Annual Report. Results of operations for interim periods\nare not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year.\nWhere necessary, the prior year’s information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Company has two wholly owned subsidiaries, Wrap Reality, Inc., an Arizona corporation, formed in December 2020 that sells a virtual reality (“VR”) training system\nprimarily targeting law enforcement agencies and Intrensic, LLC (“Intrensic”), which the Company acquired in August 2023, which specializes in Body Worn Camera and\nDigital Evidence Management solutions. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of these subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions and\naccounts.\nSegment and Related Information\nThe Company operates as a single segment. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is Scot Cohen, the Company’s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer, who manages operations for purposes of allocating resources. Refer to Note 15. Major Customers and Related Information for further discussion.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair values of the underlying net assets and liabilities assumed\nfrom an acquired business. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth\nquarter, or more frequently if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist. The Company evaluates qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value and whether it is necessary to perform goodwill impairment process.\nDefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets represent certain trade names, patents, licenses, software, acquired technology and customer relationships. Definite-lived intangible assets\nare recorded at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Definite-lived intangible assets acquired through the business\ncombination are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. The Company amortizes these acquired definite-lived intangibles assets with a finite life on a straight-line\nbasis, over 6 years for technology; 7 years for customer relationships; and 8 years for trademarks and trade names.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions (e.g., stock-based compensation valuation,\nallowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory and intangible assets, warranty reserve, accrued expense, valuation of warrants, and recognition and measurement of\ncontingencies) that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and affect the\nreported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\n6\nWarrants\nThe Company accounts for warrants as liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC\n815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition\nof a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are\nindexed to the Company’s own shares of common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the\nCompany’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant\nissuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.\nFor issued warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and\neach balance sheet date thereafter. The Company accounts for the warrants issued in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40-15-7C, under which the\nwarrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as liabilities. Accordingly, the Company classifies the warrants as liabilities at their fair value\nand adjusts the warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair\nvalue is recognized in the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nThe Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 480 and ASC 815 to determine if those\ninstruments or embedded components of those instruments qualify as derivatives and are subject to bifurcation accounting. The Company determines that the economic\ncharacteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. The convertible\ninstruments are accounted for as a single hybrid instrument. Additionally, the convertible instruments do not have any redemption features that would preclude permanent\nequity classification in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 480-10-S99.\nThe Company issued the Series A Warrants (as defined herein), which are classified as liabilities and measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and Series A Preferred\nStock (as defined herein) in one transaction. The issuance proceeds were allocated by using the with-and-without method. Under this method, the Company first allocated\nthe issuance proceeds to the Series A Warrants based on their initial fair value measurement, and then allocated the remaining proceeds to the Series A Preferred Stock.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers on January 1, 2018. The Company enters into contracts that include various combinations\nof products, accessories, software and services, each of which are generally distinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. Product sales include\nBolaWrap products and accessories. Other revenue includes VR revenues, service, training and shipping revenues.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company generally has an unconditional right to consideration when\ncustomers are invoiced, and a receivable is recorded. A contract asset is recognized when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or a contract liability (deferred revenue)\nwhen revenue will be recognized subsequent to invoicing. The Company recognizes an asset if there are incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer such as\ncommissions. These costs are ascribed to or allocated to the underlying performance obligations in the contract. The Company may receive consideration, per terms of a\ncontract, from customers prior to transferring goods to the customer. The Company records customer deposits as a contract liability. Additionally, the Company may receive\npayments, most typically for service and warranty contracts, at the onset of the contract and before the services have been performed. In such instances, a deferred revenue\nliability is recorded. The Company recognizes these contract liabilities as revenue after all revenue recognition criteria are met.\nEstimated costs for the Company’s standard warranty, generally one-year, are charged to cost of products sold when revenue is recorded for the related product. Royalties\nare also charged to cost of products sold.\nNet Income (Loss) per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income (loss), less any dividends, accretion or decretion, redemption or induced conversion, if any, on\nour Series A Preferred Stock, by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reported period.\nIn computing diluted EPS, we adjust the numerator used in the basic EPS computation, subject to anti-dilution requirements, to add back the dividends (declared or\ncumulative undeclared) applicable to the Series A Preferred Stock. Such add-back would also include any adjustments to equity in the period to accrete the Series A\nPreferred Stock to its redemption price, or recorded upon a redemption or induced conversion, if any. We adjust the denominator used in the basic EPS computation, subject\nto anti-dilution requirements, to include the dilution from potential shares resulting from the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, restricted stock units, and stock\noptions. Stock options and restricted stock units exercisable or issuable for a total of 4,979,745 and 2,668,750 shares of Common Stock were outstanding as of September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These securities are not included in the computation of diluted net loss per common share for the periods presented as their inclusion would\nbe antidilutive due to losses incurred by the Company.\nReclassification of Prior Year Presentation\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of\noperations. An adjustment has been made to the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as\nwell as the Consolidated Statements of Stockholder’s Equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, to reclassify the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock\nat par value.\n7\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures (ASU 2023-07), which requires an enhanced disclosure of significant segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. This guidance will be effective for the\nannual periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2024, and for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance\nshould be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating segment disclosures related to its annual\nreport for fiscal year 2024.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which improves the\ntransparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes\npaid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. This guidance will be effective for the\nannual periods beginning the year ended December 31, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the guidance can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The\nCompany is currently evaluating income tax disclosures related to its annual report for fiscal year 2025.\n2. REVENUE AND PRODUCT COSTS\nRevenue consists of product revenue and other revenue. Product sales include BolaWrap products and accessories. Other revenue includes VR revenue, service, training and\nshipping revenue.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company generally has an unconditional right to consideration when\ncustomers are invoiced, and a receivable is recorded. A contract asset is recognized when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or a contract liability (deferred revenue)\nwhen revenue will be recognized subsequent to invoicing. The Company recognizes an asset if there are incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer such as\ncommissions. These costs are ascribed to or allocated to the underlying performance obligations in the contract. The Company may receive consideration, per terms of a\ncontract, from customers prior to transferring goods to the customer. The Company records customer deposits as a contract liability. Additionally, the Company may receive\npayments, most typically for service and warranty contracts, at the onset of the contract and before the services have been performed. In such instances, a deferred revenue\nliability is recorded. The Company recognizes these contract liabilities as revenue after all revenue recognition criteria are met. The table below details the activity in the\nCompany's contract liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nCustomer Deferred\nDeposits Revenue\nBalance at January 1, 2024 $ 1,002 $ 544\nAdditions, net 65 724\nTransfer to revenue (1,022) (595)\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ 45 $ 673\nCurrent portion $ 45 $ 622\nLong-term portion $ - $ 51\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s deferred revenue of $673 consisted of $97 related to VR, $463 related to Intrensic, $98 related to BolaWrap extended warranties\nand services and $15 related to training.\nEstimated costs for the Company’s standard warranty, generally one-year, are charged to cost of products sold when revenue is recorded for the related product. Royalties\nare also charged to the cost of products sold.\n3. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-\nrecurring basis or disclosed at fair value, are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair values. The accounting guidance\nfor fair value provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures about how fair value is determined. Fair value is defined as the price that would\nbe received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The\naccounting guidance also establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based upon whether such\ninputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions\nmade by the reporting entity. The three-level hierarchy for the inputs to valuation techniques is briefly summarized as follows:\n8\nLevel 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\nLevel 2—Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related\nassets or liabilities; and\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.\nThe Company’s short-term investments consisting of U.S. Treasury bill securities and Certificate of Deposits are classified as Level 1 because they are valued using quoted\nmarket prices.\nThe following table shows the Company’s short-term investments by significant investment category as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024\nAdjusted Unrealized Unrealized Market\nCost Gains Losses Value\nLevel 1:\nMoney Market Funds $ 4,217 - $ - $ 4,217\nCertificate of Deposits - - - -\nTotal Financial Assets $ 4,217 $ - $ - $ 4,217\nAs of December 31, 2023\nAdjusted Unrealized Unrealized Market\nCost Gains Losses Value\nLevel 1:\nMoney Market Funds $ 1,793 - - $ 1,793\nCertificate of Deposits 7,500 - - 7,500\nTotal Financial Assets $ 9,293 $ - $ - $ 9,293\nUnrealized gains or losses resulting from our short-term investments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss as they are classified as available for\nsale. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as well as the nine months ended September 30, 2023, no gain (loss) was recorded to comprehensive loss.\nThe warrant liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The subsequent measurement of the warrant liabilities as of September 30, 2024, is classified as Level\n3 due to the use of an observable market quote in a non-active market and the management’s assumption of the expected stock price volatility.\nThe following table presents the fair value in the beginning of the period, the changes in the fair value, and the fair value at the end of the period of warrant liabilities:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nLevel 3:\nFair value at inception for December 31, 2023, or the beginning of the period for September 30, 2024 $ (19,703) $ (7,717)\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities 12,517 (11,986)\nFair value as of period end $ (7,186) $ (19,703)\n9\nThe Company uses the modified Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of warrant liabilities. The following table summarizes the assumptions used\nto compute the fair value of the Company’s warrants:\nAs of As of\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nExpected stock price volatility 100% 143%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.57% 3.85%\nDividends yield 0% 0%\nExpected life of warrants (years) 3.75 4.50\nExercise price $ 1.45 $ 1.45\nOur other financial instruments also include accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and customer deposits. Due to the short-term nature of these\ninstruments, their fair values approximate their carrying values on the balance sheet.\n4. INVENTORIES\nInventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of substantially all the Company’s inventory is determined by the FIFO cost method. Inventories\nconsisted of the following:\nAs of As of\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nFinished goods $ 4,493 $ 3,521\nRaw materials 2,295 2,738\nReserve for Obsolescence (477) (465)\nInventories - net $ 6,311 $ 5,794\n5. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following:\nAs of As of\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nProduction and lab equipment $ 542 $ 542\nTooling 572 562\nComputer equipment 618 615\nFurniture, fixtures and improvements 196 196\n$ 1,928 $ 1,915\nAccumulated depreciation (1,718) (1,406)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 210 $ 509\nDepreciation expense was $82 and $312 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $122 and $358 for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively.\n10\n6. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL\nIntangible Assets, net\nIntangible assets, net consisted of the following:\nAs of As of\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nAmortizable intangible assets:\nPatents $ 982 $ 873\nTrademarks 263 248\nPurchased software and technology 1,752 1,752\nCustomer Relationships 160 160\n$ 3,157 $ 3,033\nAccumulated amortization (1,139) (806)\nTotal amortizable $ 2,018 $ 2,227\nIndefinite life assets (non-amortizable) 421 421\nTotal intangible assets, net $ 2,439 $ 2,648\nAmortization expense was $114 and $334 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $150 and $317 for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, future amortization expense is as follows:\n2024 (3 months) $ 140\n2025 447\n2026 360\n2027 210\n2028 210\nThereafter 651\nTotal estimated amortization expense $ 2,018\nGoodwill\nDuring the three month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an increase of $29 to the goodwill associated with costs related to the August 2023\nacquisition of Intrensic.\n7. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\nWe are obligated to pay royalties pursuant to an exclusive Amended and Restated Intellectual Property License Agreement (the “License Agreement”), dated as of\nSeptember 30, 2016, with Syzygy Licensing, LLC (“Syzygy”), a private technology invention, consulting and licensing company owned and controlled by Elwood G.\nNorris, a founder and former officer and current 5% or greater stockholder of the Company, and James A. Barnes, a former officer and stockholder of the Company (see\nNote 13). Accounts payable includes $81and $14 due to Syzygy as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nAccrued liabilities consist of the following:\nAs of As of\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nPatent and legal costs $ 60 $ 21\nAccrued compensation 111 325\nWarranty costs 35 72\nTaxes and other 801 274\nTotal $ 1,007 $ 692\nChanges in our estimated product warranty costs were as follows:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nBalance, beginning of period $ 72 $ 125\nWarranty settlements (74) (8)\nWarranty provision 37 (8)\nBalance, end of period $ 35 $ 109\n11\n8. WARRANTS\nOn June 29, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Series A Purchase Agreement”) with certain directors of the Company and certain\naccredited and institutional investors (collectively, the “Series A Investors”), pursuant to which it agreed to sell to the Series A Investors in a registered direct offering (the\n“Series A Offering”) (i) an aggregate of 10,000 shares of the Company’s newly-designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, with par value $0.0001 per share and a\nstated value of $1,000 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), initially convertible into up to 6,896,553 shares of Common Stock, at an initial conversion price of $1.45\nper share (the “Conversion Price”), and (ii) warrants to acquire up to an aggregate of 6,896,553 shares of Common Stock (the “Series A Warrants”).\nEach Series A Warrant has an exercise price of $1.45 per share, became exercisable after the date that was six months from the date of issuance and will expire 5 years\nfollowing the date of issuance. The exercise price is subject to customary adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, reclassifications and the like, and subject to price-\nbased adjustment, on a “full ratchet” basis, in the event of any issuances of Common Stock, or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, at a\nprice below the then-applicable exercise price (subject to certain exceptions). The closing of the Series A Offering occurred on July 3, 2023. The aggregate gross proceeds\nfrom the Series A Offering were $10,000, of which $7,717 was allocated to the Series A Warrants.\n9. LEASES\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The guidance in FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases defines a lease as a contract, or part of a contract, which\nconveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment (an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Operating lease right\nof use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The\nCompany’s leases do not provide an implicit rate. Due to a lack of financing history or ability, the Company uses an estimate of low-grade debt rate published by the\nFederal Reserve Bank as its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.\nThe ROU asset includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred.\nFor leases beginning on or after January 1, 2019, lease components are accounted for separately from non-lease components for all asset classes. On January 21, 2023, the\nCompany’s lease was amended to extend the expiration date to July 31, 2025. Upon execution of the amendment, which was deemed a lease modification, the Company\nreassessed the lease liability using the discount rate determined at the modification date and recorded an additional ROU asset for the same amount. The Company’s lease\ncontains renewal provisions and escalating rental clauses and generally requires the Company to pay utilities, insurance, taxes and other operating expenses. The renewal\nprovisions of the existing lease agreement were not included in the determination of the operating lease liabilities and the ROU assets. The Company also reassessed the\nlease classification and concluded that the lease continues to be an operating lease.\nAmortization expense was $74 and $217 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $28 and $84 for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively.\nOperating lease expense for capitalized operating leases included in operating activities was $154 and $463 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, and $30 and $90 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nOperating lease obligations recorded on the balance sheet at September 30, 2024 are:\nOperating lease liability- short term $ 514\nOperating lease liability - long term $ 1,675\nTotal Operating Lease Liability $ 2,189\nFuture lease payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities on the balance sheet at September 30, 2024 for future periods are as follows:\n2024 (3 months) $ 72\n2025 567\n2026 507\n2027 522\n2028 538\nThereafter 1,271\nTotal future minimum lease payments $ 3,477\nLess imputed interest $ (1,288)\nTotal $ 2,189\nThe weighted average remaining lease term is 6.23 years, and the weighted average discount rate is 14.52%.\nCertain leases contain provisions for payment of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs by the Company.

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nThe Company’s authorized capital stock consists of 150,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Preferred\nStock”), of which 10,000 are designated as Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe terms of the Series A Preferred Stock are as set forth in the form of Certificate of Designations of the Series A Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Designations”), as\nfiled with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on July 3, 2023. The Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion\nShares”) at the election of the holder at any time at an initial conversion price of $1.45 per share. The Conversion Price is subject to customary adjustments for stock\ndividends, stock splits, reclassifications and the like, and subject to price-based adjustment in the event of any issuances of Common Stock, or securities convertible,\nexercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, at a price below the then-applicable Conversion Price (subject to certain exceptions).\nThe holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends of 8% per annum, compounded monthly, which are payable in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a\ncombination thereof, at the Company’s option in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designations. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a\nTriggering Event (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), the Series A Preferred Stock will accrue dividends at the rate of 20% per annum. If the Company elects to\npay any dividends in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price used to calculate the number of shares issuable will be equal to the lower of (i) the then-applicable\nConversion Price and (ii) 85% of the arithmetic average of the three (3) lowest closing prices of the Common Stock during the twenty (20) consecutive trading day period\nending on the trading day immediately preceding the dividend payment date, provided that such price shall not be lower than the lower of (x) $0.2828 (subject to adjustment\nfor stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, recapitalizations or other similar events ) and (y) 20% of the “Minimum Price” (as defined in Nasdaq Stock Market\nRule 5635) on the date of the Nasdaq Stockholder Approval (as defined herein) (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, recapitalizations\nor other similar events) or, in any case, such lower amount as permitted, from time to time, by the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nOther than Scot Cohen, V4 Global LLC or their transferees, a holder of Series A Preferred Stock cannot convert shares of its Series A Preferred Stock into shares of\nCommon Stock if the holder and its affiliates would beneficially own more than 4.99%, or 9.99% at the election of the holder, of the outstanding Common Stock after\ngiving effect to the conversion. However, any holder may increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% upon notice to us, provided\nthat any increase in this limitation will not be effective until 61 days after such notice from the holder to us and such increase or decrease will apply only to the holder\nproviding such notice.\nExcept as required by law (including without limitation, the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”)), the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to\nvote with holders of the Common Stock on as as-converted basis, with the number of votes to which each holder of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to be calculated\nassuming a conversion price of $1.414 per share, which was the Minimum Price applicable immediately before the execution and delivery of the Series A Purchase\nAgreement, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations as set forth in the Certificate of Designations. To the extent that under the DGCL the vote of the holders of\nshares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class or series, as applicable, is required to authorize a given action of the Company, the affirmative vote or\nconsent of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together in the aggregate and not in separate series unless required under the DGCL,\nrepresented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present or by written consent of such majority (except as otherwise may be required under the DGCL) shall\nconstitute the approval of such action by both the class or the series, as applicable.\nThe Company may require holders to convert their shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock if the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock\nexceeds $8.00 per share (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, recapitalizations or other similar events) for 20 consecutive trading\ndays and the daily dollar trading volume of the Common Stock exceeds $2,000,000 per day during the same period, provided that certain equity conditions described in the\nCertificate of Designations are satisfied.\nAt any time beginning 18 months from the date of the issuance, provided that that the Company has filed all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, on a timely basis for a continuous period of one year and provided further that certain equity conditions described in the Certificate of\nDesignations are satisfied, the Company has the right to redeem in cash all or some of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at such time at a redemption\nprice equal to the product of (x) 125% multiplied by (y) the sum of (A) the stated value of the Series A Preferred Stock plus (B) all declared and unpaid dividends on such\nSeries A Preferred Stock and any other unpaid amounts then due and payable hereunder with respect to such Series A Preferred Stock, plus (C) the make-whole amount,\nplus (D) any accrued and unpaid late charges with respect to such stated value and amounts payable pursuant to clause (B) as of such date of determination.\nOn August 19, 2024, the Company entered into an Amendment Agreement (the “Series A Amendment”) with the Required Holders (as defined in the Certificate of\nDesignations). Pursuant to the Series A Amendment, the Required Holders agreed that (A) the unpaid and accrued dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock due July 1,\n2024 (the “July Delinquent Dividend Amount”), shall be payable, at the option of the Company, in (i) cash and/or (ii) shares of Common Stock, at a price per share of\nCommon Stock equal to the lower of (x) $1.00 and (y) the Dividend Conversion Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), using July 1, 2024, as the applicable\ndate of determination in accordance with the Certificate of Designations; (B) the dividends due on October 1, 2024 (the “October Dividend Amount” and, together with the\nJuly Delinquent Dividend Amount, the “Delinquent Dividend Amounts”), shall be payable in shares of Common Stock based on a per share price of Common Stock equal to\n80% of the arithmetic average of the three (3) lowest closing sale prices of the Common Stock during the month of September 2024; and (C) such Delinquent Dividend\nAmounts and any Dividend Balance Shares (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), with respect thereto, if applicable, shall be delivered on October 1, 2024 and the\nPre-Dividend Shares (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) with respect to each of the July Delinquent Dividend Amount and the October Dividend Amount, if\napplicable, shall be delivered to the Series A Investors on or prior to the twenty-first (21st) trading day prior to October 1, 2024. The Company and the Required Holders\nfurther agreed pursuant to the Series A Amendment to amend (i) the Certificate of Designations, as described below, by filing a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate\nof Designations (the “Certificate of Amendment”) and (ii) the Series A Purchase Agreement to amend the definition of “Excluded Securities.”\nThe Certificate of Amendment amended the Certificate of Designations to, among other things, (A) allow for the payment of dividends in the form of Common Stock to a\nholder of the Series A Preferred Stock who serves as a director, officer or employee of the Company; provided that such issuance is approved by the Company’s\nstockholders prior to such issuance, which was subsequently further amended by the October 2024 Certificate of Amendment (as defined below), (B) amend certain\nconditions required for (i) a mandatory conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii) the Company’s right to redeem, all or a portion, of the Series A Preferred Stock\noutstanding pursuant to an optional redemption, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designations, and (C) amend the definition of “Excluded Securities”\nto exclude Dividend Shares (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) and shares of Common Stock issued in connection with the payments of dividends. The\nCertificate of Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on August 23, 2024.\n13\nOn October 14, 2024, the Company entered into an Amendment Agreement (the “October 2024 Series A Amendment”) with the Required Holders. Pursuant to the October\n2024 Series A Amendment, the Required Holders agreed to further amend the Certificate of Designations (the “October 2024 Certificate of Amendment”). Pursuant to the\nOctober 2024 Certificate of Amendment, (i) the Series A Preferred Stock is now entitled to voting rights as described therein, (ii) certain holders of the Series A Preferred\nStock are no longer subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations as described in the Certificate of Designations, and (iii) stockholder approval is no longer required in\nconnection with the payment of dividends in the form of Common Stock to a holder of the Series A Preferred Stock who serves as a director, officer or employee of the\nCompany. The October 2024 Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 14, 2024. See Note 16, “Subsequent\nEvents,” for additional information.\nAt the time of issuance, $2,036 of the net proceeds less transaction cost of the Series A Offering was allocated to the 10,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock initially\nissued. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, 102 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were converted into 76,440 shares of Common Stock and during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, an additional 1,691 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted into 1,391,183 shares of Common Stock. As of September\n30, 2024, the Company has authorized and declared $1,017 in dividends during the year of which $818 was accrued in accounts payable as of September 30, 2024.\n11. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nOn March 31, 2017, the Company adopted, and the stockholders approved, the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) authorizing 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock for\nissuance as awards to employees, directors or consultants. In May 2019, the stockholders ratified an increase in the Plan authorizing an additional 2,100,000 shares of\nCommon Stock; in June 2020, the stockholders ratified an additional 1,900,000 shares of Common Stock; in June 2021, the stockholders ratified an additional 1,500,000\nshares of Common Stock; and in June 2022, the stockholders ratified an additional 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock; for a total of 9,000,000 shares subject to the Plan.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were 275,422 shares of Common Stock remaining available for grant under the Plan.\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nWeighted Average\nOptions on Remaining Aggregate\nCommon Exercise Contractual Intrinsic\nShares Price Term Value\nOutstanding January 1, 2024 4,657,635 $ 2.52 8.75 $ 3,979\nGranted 1,495,000 $ 2.24 - -\nExercised (232,081) $ 2.53 - -\nForfeited, cancelled, expired (1,928,925) $ 3.00 - -\nOutstanding September 30, 2024 3,991,629 $ 2.18 8.64 $ 180\nExercisable September 30, 2024 1,200,536 $ 3.33 6.96 $ 40\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were 2,701,463 service-based stock options outstanding, and 1,290,166 performance-based stock options outstanding, which were granted\nin October 2023 to the Company's current Chief Executive Officer subject to future market capitalization targets.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of service-based options granted. The following table summarizes the assumptions\nused to compute the fair value of options granted to employees and non-employees:\nFor the Nine Months\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023\nExpected stock price volatility 76% 49%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.79% 3.64%\nExpected dividend yield 0% 0%\nExpected life of options 6.00 6.66\nWeighted-average fair value of options granted $ 1.48 $ 0.55\nEstimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company’s stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of awards. The Company’s\nestimated volatility was based on an average of the historical volatility of peer entities whose stock prices were publicly available. The Company’s calculation of estimated\nvolatility is based on historical stock prices of these peer entities over a period equal to the expected life of the awards. The Company uses the historical volatility of peer\nentities due to the lack of sufficient historical data of its stock price. The Company records forfeitures as they are incurred.\nThe risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds whose maturity period is appropriate for the term of the\noptions. The dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and has no present intention to pay cash dividends. The Company\ncalculates the expected life of the options using the Simplified Method for the employee stock options as the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data.\nStock option expense was $341 and $776 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $(169) and $399 for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively.\n14\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Plan provides for the grant of restricted stock units (“RSUs”). RSUs are settled in shares of the Company’s Common Stock as the RSUs vest. The following table\nsummarizes RSU activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average\nAverage Vesting\nService-Based Grant Date Period\nRSU's Fair Value (Years)\nUnvested at January 1, 2024 810,588 $ 1.73 2.52\nGranted - service based 800,336 $ 2.71 -\nVested (385,081) $ 2.11 -\nForfeited and cancelled (237,727) $ 2.26 -\nUnvested at September 30, 2024 988,116 $ 2.26 3.26\nThe Company used the Monte Carlo Simulation Model to value at the grant date the aggregate of 632,911 market condition performance RSUs granted in January 2024 to\nthe Company’s Chief Executive Officer. The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo Simulation were stock price on the date of grant of $3.40, a contract term of 10 years,\nexpected volatility of 78% and risk-free interest rate of 4.10%. Vesting is based on sustained market capitalization of $1 billion, and the derived service period is 4.3 years.\nRSU expense was $555 and $1,038 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $(33) and $1,249 for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company recorded share-based compensation for options and RSUs in its statements of operations for the relevant periods as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSelling, general and administrative $ 878 $ (149) $ 1,735 $ 1,404\nResearch and development 18 (53) 79 244\nTotal share-based expense $ 896 $ (202) $ 1,814 $ 1,648\nAs of September 30, 2024, total estimated compensation cost of stock options granted and outstanding but not yet vested was $2,657 which is expected to be recognized\nover the weighted average period of 2.50 years.\nAs of September 30, 2024, total estimated compensation cost of RSUs granted and outstanding but not yet vested was $1,773, which is expected to be recognized over the\nweighted average period of 3.26 years.\n12. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN\nThe Company has a defined contribution savings plan for all eligible U.S. employees established under the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This\nplan was formed on January 1, 2022. Eligible employees may contribute a percentage of their salary subject to certain limitations. The Company’s contributions for each of\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was $0.\n13.

The Company may also\nundertake indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business related to its operations. The Company is unable to estimate with any reasonable accuracy the\nliability that may be incurred pursuant to any such indemnification obligations now or in the future. Because of the uncertainty surrounding these circumstances, the\nCompany’s current or future indemnification obligations could range from immaterial to having a material adverse impact on its financial position and its ability to continue\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company has no liabilities recorded for such indemnities.\nRegulatory Agencies\nThe Company is subject to oversight from regulatory agencies regarding firearms that arise in the ordinary course of its business.\nLitigation\nThe Company is subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is\nboth probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed and adjusted to include the impacts of\nnegotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. As of September 30, 2024, the\nCompany had no provision for liability under existing litigation.\n14.

Wrap Intrensic Evidence on our cloud-based video storage platform provides an unlimited video storage platform that includes video and other evidence\nuploading, search, retrieval, redaction, and evidence sharing while reducing the need for resources required to manage this evidence.\nIn addition to the U.S. law enforcement market, we have shipped our restraint products to 62 countries. We have established an active distributor network representing 50\nstates and one dealer representing the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We have distribution agreements with 35 international distributors covering 75 countries. We focus\nsignificant sales, training and business development efforts to support our distribution network in addition to our internal sales team.\nWe focus significant resources on research and development innovations and continue to enhance our products and plan to introduce new products. We believe we have\nestablished a strong brand and market presence globally and have established significant competitive advantages in our markets.\n18\nBusiness Outlook and Challenges\nWe believe our Company's products and solutions are gaining global recognition and awareness through various channels such as social media, trade shows, and media\nexposure, among others. In part, this recognition and awareness can be attributed to positive feedback from law enforcement agencies and the successful deployment of our\nproducts. As a result, we believe our brand is becoming increasingly recognized on a global scale as a leader in remote restraint and non-lethal solutions.\nIn addition, we are focused on marketing and public relations efforts. We believe there are market opportunities for our remote restraint and virtual reality solutions in the\nlaw enforcement and security sectors worldwide. These opportunities are driven by the increasing demand for less-lethal policing.\nIn the law enforcement sector, our BolaWrap product has been successfully deployed in the field, as reported by many agencies. BolaWrap is now in use by over 900 U.S.\nlaw enforcement agencies and in 62 countries. Due to its safe remote restraint capabilities, some agencies do not deem its usage a categorical reportable use of force and\nrather place it underneath early use of force such as handcuffs. In our strategic roadmap, we clarified that law enforcement agencies deploy BolaWrap when verbal\ncommands breakdown, but long before there is justifiable escalation to pepper spray, pepper ball, batons, bean bags, tasers or Conducted Electrical Weapons (CEW’s) or\nfirearms.\nSome agencies voluntarily report usage to us, but many do not. In the usage reports we have been provided, officers have reported successful outcomes in 84% of the use\ncases. This percentage is higher than what is often seen with less lethal tools. From the information we have been provided, the most common BolaWrap use case is for\nindividuals with behavioral health issues, and the second most common BolaWrap use case is during domestic violence calls. 26% of the reported persons who are wrapped\nwith the BolaWrap are thought to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\nThere are many reasons why we may not receive reports on all the use of the BolaWrap, including, when uses of BolaWrap are considered evidence in ongoing criminal\ncases, are controlled by local policy or regulation, or require officer and union permission to be shared with us. However, some agencies have shared bodycam footage of\nsuccessful field deployments with us, which we may use in our training and education efforts. We believe that as the reports of BolaWrap's effectiveness in de-escalation\ncontinue to increase, it will contribute to our future revenue growth.\nWe anticipate and believe that our portfolio of safe, remote restraint products and training services has a strong and expanding pipeline of market opportunities in the law\nenforcement, military, corrections, and homeland security sectors both domestically and internationally. With the increasing demand for more humane and safer policing\npractices, we expect a continued surge in our global business. Currently, we are exploring major international business prospects, while simultaneously seeking to establish\nrelationships with large police agencies in the U.S. However, we acknowledge that it is challenging to predict the exact timeline for closing these deals, or whether they will\nultimately materialize.\n19\nAs part of our efforts to expand our sales and distribution operations, we provide a comprehensive training program for law enforcement officers and trainers in using the\nBolaWrap. This training equips them with knowledge about the appropriate use and limitations of BolaWrap in tandem with modern policing techniques for de-escalation of\nencounters. We now focus on also teaching when and why BolaWrap should be used, including the specific area of success, such as after verbal commands break down and\nbefore the law enforcement officer is ready to escalate to less lethal pain compliance tools. We believe that law enforcement trainers and officers who have been trained to\nuse our products, or have witnessed demonstrations, are more inclined to support the acquisition and deployment of our products by their respective departments to drive\nsuccessful outcomes. As of September 30, 2024, over 1,530 agencies have received BolaWrap training with over 5,400 training officers at those agencies certified as\nBolaWrap instructors and qualified to train the rest of their departments, representing a 10% increase in agencies and a 10% increase in trained officers as compared to\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nOperating expense of $13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $2.3 million, when compared to operating expense of $15.3 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of the Company’s cost containment initiatives enacted beginning in the first half of 2024 as well as a reduction in share-\nbased compensation, offset by increased occupancy expenses related to our new office space.\nAlthough geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic challenges have affected our quarterly results in the past and may in the future, we believe our Company is uniquely\npositioned to provide lifesaving technologies and training that enable law enforcement officers worldwide to conduct safe and effective encounters while reducing the use of\nforce. If departments follow our Use of Force Guarantee requirements, we have offered to buy back their BolaWrap devices if their reportable use of force is not reduced by\n10%. With an increasing addressable market, the Company offers what we believe is a unique value proposition. Our improved pricing strategy, coupled with reduced\noperating expenses and our growing sales outlook, is expected to help reduce losses and improve cash flow in the future.\nWe plan to increase the number of product demonstrations and training sessions, particularly in international markets. Our new focus on the when and why BolaWrap is\nused has shown improved results. This is a departure from the hardware product only approach of the past. Our sales of the BolaWrap 150 and Wrap Reality are expected to\ncontinue to rise, aided by our ongoing cost savings and cost control measures, which we expect to lead to an overall reduction in cash burn.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had backlog of approximately $156 thousand which is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, as of September\n30, 2024, we had deferred revenue of $673 thousand, which consisted of $97 thousand related to VR, $463 thousand related to Intrensic, $98 thousand related to BolaWrap\nextended warranties and services and $15 thousand related to training. Distributor and customer orders for future deliveries are generally subject to modification,\nrescheduling or in some instances, cancellation, in the normal course of business.\nSince inception, we have generated significant losses from operations and anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses from operations for the foreseeable\nfuture. We believe that we have adequate financial resources to sustain our operations for the next twelve months following this Report. We recorded net income of $1.7\nmillion during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to net loss of $11.8 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023, an improvement of approximately\n$13.5 million for the comparable period. Net cash used in operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $6.0 million less than net cash used in\noperations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net cash used in operations during the first nine months of 2024 was primarily driven by the\nCompany’s cost containment efforts initiated in the first half of 2024.\nWe expect that we will continue to innovate new applications for our public safety technology, open new geographies, develop new products and technologies to meet\ndiverse customer requirements and identify and develop new markets for our products.\nSupply chain disruptions also affected our operations and could negatively impact our ability to source materials, manufacture and distribute products in the future.\nMoreover, financial markets continue to experience significant volatility, which could potentially affect our ability to enter into or modify favorable terms and conditions\nregarding equity and debt financing activities. Nevertheless, we had $4.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024. We therefore believe we have\nsufficient capital to fund our operations for the next twelve months following this Report. However, we may require additional working capital and liquidity constraints and\naccess to capital markets could still negatively affect our liquidity and may require changes to our plan of operations.\nOur Company may be positively or negatively impacted by continued social unrest, protests against racial inequality, and movements like \"Defund the Police.\" Such unrest\nmay be further fueled by misleading information or negative publicity about our solutions. We believe our solutions are the answer to reducing use of force and driving safer\noutcomes for officers and the citizens they interact with each day. Although the intensity of these events may have subsided, some may still indirectly or directly, influence\npolice agency budgets and the funding available to current and potential customers. In addition, participants in these events may attempt to create the impression that our\nsolutions are contributing to the perceived problems, potentially harming our business and operations, including our revenues, earnings, and cash flows from operations.\nChanges in our management and other critical personnel have the potential to positively or negatively affect our business. Such disruptions could have an adverse impact on\nour operations, programs, growth, financial condition, or results of operations. On the other hand, improvements in our operations, operating expenses, and go-to-market\napproaches could positively influence the success of our business in the future.\nNasdaq Listing Requirements\nOn April 18, 2024, the Company received a notice (the “Initial Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the\nCompany that as it has not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “2023 Form 10-K”) for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company is not in compliance\nwith Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Listing Rule”) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Additionally, on May 17, 2024, the Company received a notice from\nNasdaq notifying the Company that as it has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Q1 Form 10-Q”) for the three months ended March 31, 2024, the\nCompany is not in compliance with the Listing Rule for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOn August 16, 2024, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that as it has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Q2 Form 10-\nQ,” and collectively with the Q1 Form 10-Q, the “Delinquent Filings”) for the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company is not in compliance with the Listing Rule\nfor continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nThe Company previously submitted a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance with respect to the delinquent 2023 Form 10-K and Q1 Form 10-Q (the “Plan”), and Nasdaq\ngranted an exception until August 30, 2024, to file the delinquent 2023 Form 10-K and Q1 Form 10-Q. On August 28, 2024, the 2023 Form 10-K was filed with the SEC.\nNasdaq granted the Company an additional exception of up to a maximum of 180 calendar days from the filing due date of the 2023 Form 10-K to file the Delinquent\nFilings, or until October 14, 2024, to regain compliance. The Company filed the Q1 Form 10-Q with the SEC on September 25, 2024, and filed the Q2 Form 10-Q with the\nSEC on October 14, 2024, and regained compliance with Nasdaq.\n20\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates,\non an on-going basis, including those estimates related to recognition and measurement of contingencies and accrued expense. We base our estimates on historical\nexperience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions.\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in\ndetermining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, tax contingencies, unrecognized tax benefits, and any required valuation allowance, including\ntaking into consideration the probability of the tax contingencies being incurred. Management assesses this probability based upon information provided by its tax advisers,\nits legal advisers and similar tax cases. If later our assessment of the probability of these tax contingencies changes, our accrual for such tax uncertainties may increase or\ndecrease. Our effective tax rate for annual and interim reporting periods could be impacted if uncertain tax positions that are not recognized are settled at an amount which\ndiffers from our estimates.\nSome of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include share-based compensation and contingencies and areas\nsuch as revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory and intangible assets, estimates of product line exit costs, warranty liabilities and\nimpairments.\nRevenue Recognition. We sell our products to customers including law enforcement agencies, domestic distributors and international distributors and revenue from such\ntransactions is recognized in the periods that products are shipped (free on board (“FOB”) shipping point) or received by customers (FOB destination), when the fee is fixed\nor determinable and when collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured. We identify customer performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate\nthe transaction price to the performance obligations and recognize revenue as we satisfy the performance obligations. Our primary performance obligations are\nproducts/accessories and VR software licensing or sale. Our customers do not have the right to return product unless the product is found to be defective.\nShare-Based Compensation. We follow the fair value recognition provisions issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) in Accounting Standards\nCodification (“ASC”) Topic 718, Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”) and we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-07 for share-based transactions with non-\nemployees. Share-based compensation expense recognized includes stock option and restricted stock unit compensation expense. The grant date fair value of stock options\nis determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date is the date at which an employer and employee or non-employee reach a mutual understanding\nof the key terms and conditions of a share-based payment award. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs including the market price of the Company’s\nCommon Stock on the date of grant, the term that the stock options are expected to be outstanding, the implied stock volatilities of several publicly traded peers over the\nexpected term of stock options, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine. The\ngrant date fair value of restricted stock units is based upon the market price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of the grant. We determine the amount of share-\nbased compensation expense based on awards that we ultimately expect to vest and account for forfeitures as they occur. The fair value of share-based compensation is\namortized to compensation expense over the vesting term.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. Our products are sold to customers in many different markets and geographic locations. We estimate our bad debt reserve on a case-by-\ncase basis and the aging of accounts due to a limited number of customers mostly government agencies or well-established distributors. We base these estimates on many\nfactors including customer credit worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. Our\njudgments and estimates regarding collectability of accounts receivable have an impact on our financial statements.\nValuation of Inventory. Our inventory is comprised of raw materials, assemblies and finished products. We must periodically make judgments and estimates regarding the\nfuture utility and carrying value of our inventory. The carrying value of our inventory is periodically reviewed and impairments, if any, are recognized when the expected\nfuture benefit from our inventory is less than carrying value.\n21\nValuation of Intangible Assets. Intangible assets consisted of (a) capitalized legal fees and filing expense related to obtaining patents and trademarks, (b) customer\nagreements, tradenames, software, non-solicitation and non-compete agreements acquired in business combinations and valued at fair value at the acquisition date, and (c)\nthe purchase cost of indefinite-lived website domains. We must make judgments and estimates regarding the future utility and carrying value of intangible assets. The\ncarrying values of such assets are periodically reviewed and impairments, if any, are recognized when the expected future benefit to be derived from an individual intangible\nasset is less than carrying value. This generally could occur when certain assets are no longer consistent with our business strategy and whose expected future value has\ndecreased.\nAccrued Expense. We establish a warranty reserve based on anticipated warranty claims at the time product revenue is recognized. This reserve requires us to make\nestimates regarding the amount and costs of warranty repairs we expect to make over a period of time. Factors affecting warranty reserve levels include the number of units\nsold, anticipated cost of warranty repairs, and anticipated rates of warranty claims. We have very limited history to make such estimates and warranty estimates have an\nimpact on our financial statements. Warranty expense is recorded in cost of revenue. We evaluate the adequacy of this reserve each reporting period.\nWe use the recognition criteria of FASB ASC Topic 450-20, Loss Contingencies, to estimate the amount of bonuses when it becomes probable a bonus liability will be\nincurred, and we recognize expense ratably over the service period. We accrue bonus expense each quarter based on estimated year-end results, and then adjust the actual in\nthe fourth quarter based on our final results compared to targets.\nWarrants. The Company accounts for warrants as liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative\nguidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC\n815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition\nof a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are\nindexed to the Company’s own common shares and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s\ncontrol, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and\nas of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.\nBusiness Combination. The Company accounts for its business combinations under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 805-10, Business\nCombinations (\"ASC 805-10\"), which requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed,\nincluding non-controlling interests, are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The estimated fair value of net assets acquired, including the\nallocation of the fair value to identifiable assets and liabilities, was determined using established valuation techniques. ASC 805-10 also specifies criteria that intangible\nassets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of\nthe tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combinations and\nare expensed as incurred.\nThe estimated fair value of the acquired intangible assets was determined using a method which reflects the present value of the operating cash flows generated by this asset\nafter taking into account the cost to realize the revenue, and an appropriate discount rate to reflect the time value and risk associated with the invested capital.\nCertain adjustments to the assessed fair values of the assets and liabilities made subsequent to the acquisition date, but within the measurement period, which is up to one\nyear, are recorded as adjustments to goodwill. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in income.\nHistorically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. Other than the warrants\nand business combination described above, there were no significant changes or modification of our critical accounting policies and estimates involving management\nvaluation adjustments affecting our results for the period ended September 30, 2024. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1. Organization and Summary\nof Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report.\nSegment and Related Information\nThe Company operates as a single segment. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is Scot Cohen, the Company’s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer, who manages operations for purposes of allocating resources. Refer to Note 15. Major Customers and Related Information, in our financial statements for further\ndiscussion.\nOperating Expense\nOur operating expense includes (i) selling, general and administrative expense, (ii) research and development expense, and in the most recent fiscal quarter, and (iii) product\nline exit expense. Research and development expense is comprised of the costs incurred in performing research and development activities and developing production on\nour behalf, including compensation and consulting, design and prototype costs, contract services, patent costs and other outside expense. The scope and magnitude of our\nfuture research and development expense is difficult to predict at this time and will depend on elections made regarding research projects, staffing levels and outside\nconsulting and contract costs. The future level of selling, general and administrative expense will be dependent on staffing levels, elections regarding expenditures on sales,\nmarketing and customer training, the use of outside resources, public company and regulatory expense, and other factors, some of which are outside of our control.\nWe expect our operating costs will continue to reduce from the first quarter of 2024, as a result of the changes from ongoing cost containment efforts. We may incur\nadditional non-cash share-based compensation costs depending on future option and restricted stock unit grants that are impacted by stock prices and other valuation factors.\nHistorical expenditures are not indicative of future expenditures.\n22\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 (Unaudited)\nThe following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items of our condensed consolidated statement of operations. The financial information and the discussion\nbelow should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes contained in this Report.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(in thousands, except for percentage change)\nRevenues:\nProduct sales $ 434 $ 3,248 $ (2,814) (87)%\nOther revenue 159 383 (224) (58)%\nTotal revenues 593 3,631 (3,038) (84)%\nCost of revenue 358 1,454 (1,096) (75)%\nGross profit $ 235 $ 2,177 $ (1,942) (89)%\nOperating expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative 3,334 4,317 (983) (23)%\nResearch and development 527 610 (83) (14)%\nTotal operating expenses 3,861 4,927 (1,066) (22)%\nLoss from operations $ (3,626) $ (2,750) $ (876) (32)%\nRevenue\nWe reported net revenue of $593 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an\n84% decrease compared to the prior year. The decrease in 2024 as compared to the prior year is primarily a result of 2023 revenues that included large order intake in\nEMEA.\nWe incurred product promotional costs of $1 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a 98% decrease as compared to $61 thousand for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023. The 2023 product promotional costs were related primarily to BolaWrap 150 demonstration products, and the cost of training\nproducts and accessories delivered to law enforcement agencies that were expensed as marketing costs.\n23\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $235 thousand, or a gross margin of 40%. Our gross profit for the three months ended September 30,\n2023, was $2.2 million, or a gross margin of 60%. The 89% year-over-year decrease in gross profit was a result of lower volumes of BolaWrap 150 product sales slightly\noffset by the added high-margin revenue from the Company’s Intrensic acquisition in August 2023.\nAs our revenue history is limited, historical margins may not accurately reflect future margins. However, we expect higher margins with the production of the BolaWrap\n150 compared to previous production due to design changes and improved pricing, as well as our higher margin revenue from the Intrensic product offerings. Our margins\nare also subject to variations based on the sales channels and product mix through which our products are sold. At present, our cassettes have lower margins than BolaWrap\ndevices. As we scale cassette production, we will look to reduce our costs and drive higher cassette margins. Cassettes were a total of 10% of our overall revenue in the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024, and will continue to grow as a recurring revenue base as more BolaWrap devices are in the field and the usage of BolaWrap\nincreases due to the need of officers to de-escalate earlier to prevent injuries and use of higher levels of force.\nWe regularly introduce updates and revisions to our products, which may include changes to raw materials and components, and can impact our product costs. Given our\nlimited experience with warranty costs, our estimated future warranty expense may affect our gross margins.\nOur global supply chain has experienced notable component shortages, extended lead times, cost fluctuations, and logistical constraints, all of which have affected our\nproduct costs. Although we have seen these supply chain obstacles ease in 2024, we acknowledge that future supplier shortages, quality problems, and logistics delays could\nimpact our production schedules and have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense of $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was reduced by $1.0 million when compared to $4.3\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily the result of the Company’s cost containment initiatives enacted\nbeginning in the first half of 2024 which was offset by an increase of $1.0 million in share-based compensation as well as by increased occupancy expenses related to our\nnew office space.\nShare-based compensation costs allocated to SG&A increased to $896 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a negative $149 thousand for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting from forfeitures and cancellations in 2023.\nSalaries and burden costs of $756 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $880 thousand lower than in the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This reduction reflects an approximate 32% reduction in the Company’s workforce including a reduction of certain C-Level positions. During the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, we decreased professional and consulting fees by $907 thousand reflecting\nthe Company’s cost containment efforts. We expect expenditures for SG&A expenses in 2024 to continue to decline in the last quarter of 2024, as a result of the Company’s\ncost cutting initiatives.\nAdvertising and promotion costs were $81 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, or a decrease of $143 thousand as compared to $224 thousand for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. The changes in advertising costs were primarily related to reduced trade show costs offset by slight increases in digital marketing\ncampaigns.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense decreased by $83 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three months ended September 30,\n2023. We incurred a $36 thousand period over period increase in compensation expense as well as a $71 thousand period over period decrease in share-based compensation\nexpense allocated to research and development expense as a result of reduction of personnel. Outside consulting costs decreased by $8 thousand for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the Company’s move to a more variable cost model.\n24\nOperating Loss\nLoss from operations of $3.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was an increase of $876 thousand compared to loss from operations of $2.8\nmillion during the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflecting the reduced revenues offset by lower operating costs from the Company’s cost containment\nefforts.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items of our condensed consolidated statement of operations. The financial information and the discussion\nbelow should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes contained in this Report.\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n2024 2023 $ %\n(in thousands, except for percentage change)\nRevenue:\nProduct sales $ 3,012 $ 4,897 (1,885) (38)%\nOther revenue 630 647 (17) (3)%\nTotal revenue 3,642 5,544 (1,902) (34)%\nCost of revenue 1,587 2,347 (760) (32)%\nGross profit 2,055 3,197 (1,142) (36)%\nOperating expense:\nSelling, general and administrative 11,029 12,604 (1,575) (12)%\nResearch and development 1,960 2,683 (723) (27)%\nTotal operating expense 12,989 15,287 (2,298) (15)%\nLoss from operations $ (10,934) $ (12,090) 1,156 (10)%\nRevenue\nWe reported net revenue of $3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a 34%\ndecrease. The decrease in 2024 is primarily a result of a $2.3 million decrease in sales of BolaWrap devices, cartridges and accessories to distributors in EMEA. We\nincurred discounts of $18 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $132 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We\nexpect a continued decline to minimal discounts throughout 2024, as we have phased out our promotional upgrade offer.\nWe incurred product promotional costs of $101 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related primarily to BolaWrap 150 demonstration products and\nthe cost of training products and accessories delivered to law enforcement agencies that were expensed as marketing costs. We are responding to increased demand for\ntraining as a result of expanded product and brand awareness and increased successful field use by agencies but, due to increased awareness, expect reductions in product\npromotional costs throughout 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had deferred revenue of $673 thousand, which consisted of $97 thousand related to VR, $463 thousand related to Intrensic, $98 thousand\nrelated to BolaWrap extended warranties and services and $15 thousand related to training.\n25\nOn September 30, 2024, we had backlog of $260 thousand expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2024. Distributor and customer orders for future deliveries are\ngenerally subject to modification, rescheduling or, in some instances, cancellation in the normal course of business.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $2.1 million, or a gross margin of 56%. Our gross profit for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023, was $3.2 million, or a gross margin of 58%. The 36% year-over-year decrease in gross profit was a result of higher volumes of the BolaWrap 150 product sold to\nEMEA distributors in 2023 that were slightly offset by the added high-margin revenue from the Company’s Intrensic acquisition in August 2023.\nAs our revenue history is limited, historical margins may not accurately reflect future margins. However, we expect higher margins with the production of the BolaWrap\n150 compared to previous production due to design changes and improved pricing. Our margins are also subject to variations based on the sales channels and product mix\nthrough which our products are sold. At present, our cassettes have lower margins than BolaWrap devices. As we scale cassette production, we will look to reduce our costs\nand drive higher cassette margins. Cassettes were a total of 13% of our overall revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and will continue to grow as a\nrecurring revenue base as more BolaWrap devices are in the field and the usage of BolaWrap increases due to the need of officers to de-escalate earlier to prevent injuries\nand use of higher levels of force.\nWe regularly introduce updates and revisions to our products, which may include changes to raw materials and components, and can impact our product costs. Given our\nlimited experience with warranty costs, our estimated future warranty expense may affect our gross margins.\nOur global supply chain has experienced notable component shortages, extended lead times, cost fluctuations, and logistical constraints, all of which have affected our\nproduct costs. Although we have seen these supply chain obstacles ease in 2024, we acknowledge that future supplier shortages, quality problems, and logistics delays could\nimpact our production schedules and have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSG&A expense of $11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by $1.6 million when compared to $12.6 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, as a result of the Company’s cost containment initiatives enacted beginning in the first half of 2024 offset by increased occupancy expenses related to\nour new office space.\nShare-based compensation costs allocated to SG&A increased to $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.4 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. This $331 thousand increase resulted primarily due to changes in management and changes in the Company’s stock price.\nSalaries and burden costs of $3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was a $1.4 million decrease compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we increased our occupancy costs by $615 thousand,\nwhich was offset by a reduction of professional fees by $807 thousand and travel and entertainment costs by $211 thousand. We expect expenditures for SG&A expense in\n2024 to be lower than 2023 as a result of the Company’s cost containment initiatives enacted beginning in the first half 2024.\nAdvertising and promotion costs were $552 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or a decrease of $117 thousand as compared to $669 thousand for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in advertising costs was related to decreases in video and testimonial costs as well as reductions in trade shows and\nother cost containment efforts.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense decreased by $723 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2024. We incurred a $130 thousand period over period decrease in compensation expense allocated to research and development expense as a result of personnel changes\nalong with a $165 thousand period over period decrease in share-based compensation expense allocated to research and development expense as a result of personnel\nchanges. Outside consulting costs decreased by $101 thousand and material costs were lower by $128 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared\nto the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n26\nOperating Loss\nLoss from operations of $10.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, represents a reduction of $1.2 million compared to loss from operations of $12.1\nmillion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting increased focus on reducing operating costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary source of liquidity to date has been funding from our stockholders from the sale of equity securities and the exercise of derivative securities, consisting of\noptions and warrants. We expect our primary source of future liquidity will be from the sale of products, exercise of stock options and warrants and from future equity or\ndebt financings.\nWe have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.9 million,\nworking capital of $1.6 million including the $7.2 million value of the Series A Warrants recorded in connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock in July\n2023, and had sustained cumulative losses attributable to stockholders of $97.3 million. Our working capital net of the warrants-short term at September 30, 2024 was $8.6\nmillion lower compared to December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of operating losses of $10.9 million for the period. Our working capital as of September 30, 2024 was\nnegatively affected by the continued operating losses during the prior twelve months. We believe we have sufficient capital to fund our operations for the next twelve\nmonths following this Report. However, liquidity constraints and access to capital markets could still negatively affect our liquidity and may require changes to our\ninvestment strategy.\nCapital Requirements\nOur future liquidity requirements or future capital needs will depend on, among other things, capital required to introduce new products and the operational staffing and\nsupport requirements, as well as the timing and amount of future revenue and product costs. We anticipate that demands for operating and working capital may grow\ndepending on decisions on staffing, development, production, marketing, training and other functions and based on other factors outside of our control, including the timing\nof receipt of revenue.\nOur future capital requirements, cash flows and results of operations could be affected by, and will depend on, many factors, some of which are currently unknown to us,\nincluding, among other things:\n●Any future outbreaks pandemics or contagious diseases or fear of such outbreaks;\n●Decisions regarding staffing, development, production, marketing and other functions;\n●The timing and extent of market acceptance of our products;\n●Costs, timing and outcome of planned production and required customer and regulatory compliance of our products;\n●Costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting our patent applications and defending any future intellectual property-related claims;\n●Costs and timing of additional product development;\n●Costs, timing and outcome of any future warranty claims or litigation against us associated with any of our products;\n●Ability to collect accounts receivable; and\n●Timing and costs associated with any new financing.\nPrincipal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources including from exercise of outstanding warrants and options include:\n● Volatility in the capital markets; and\n● Market price and trading volume of our Common Stock.\n27\n2023 Offering\nOn June 29, 2023, the Company entered into a Series Purchase Agreement (“Series A Purchase Agreement”) with certain accredited investors, including the Company’s\nExecutive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (collectively, the “Series A Investors”), pursuant to which it agreed to sell to the Series A Investors in a registered direct\noffering (the “Series A Offering”) (i) an aggregate of 10,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, initially convertible into up to 6,896,553 shares of the Company’s Common\nStock, at an initial conversion price of $1.45 per share, and (ii) warrants (the “Series A Warrants”) to acquire up to an aggregate of 6,896,553 shares of Common Stock (the\n“Series A Warrant Shares”). The conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock is subject to customary adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, reclassifications and\nthe like, and subject to price-based adjustment in the event of any issuances of Common Stock, or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, at\na price below the then-applicable conversion price (subject to certain exceptions). The closing of the Series A Offering occurred on July 3, 2023. The aggregate gross\nproceeds from the Series A Offering were $10 million. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the Series A Offering for general corporate purposes.\nThe Company engaged Katalyst Securities LLC (the “Placement Agent”) to act as exclusive placement agent in connection with the Series A Offering. Pursuant to an\nEngagement Letter with the Placement Agent, we paid to the Placement Agent or its designees (i) a cash fee equal to 8% of the gross proceeds of the Series A Offering and\n(ii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 551,725 shares of Common Stock (equal to 8% of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Series A Preferred Stock sold in the\nSeries A Offering) at an exercise price of $1.45 per share.\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nThe terms of the Series A Preferred Stock are as set forth in the form of Certificate of Designations of the Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock is\nconvertible into shares of Common Stock (the “Conversion Shares”) at the election of the holder at any time at an initial conversion price of $1.45 per share (the\n“Conversion Price”). The Conversion Price is subject to customary adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, reclassifications and the like, and subject to price-based\nadjustment in the event of any issuances of Common Stock, or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, at a price below the then-applicable\nConversion Price (subject to certain exceptions).\nThe holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends of 8% per annum, compounded monthly, which are payable in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a\ncombination thereof, at the Company’s option in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designations. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a\nTriggering Event (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), the Series A Preferred Stock will accrue dividends at the rate of 20% per annum. If the Company elects to\npay any dividends in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price used to calculate the number of shares issuable will be equal to the lower of (i) the then applicable\nConversion Price and (ii) 85% of the arithmetic average of the three (3) lowest closing prices of the Common Stock during the twenty (20) consecutive trading day period\nending on the trading day immediately preceding the dividend payment date, provided that such price shall not be lower than the lower of (x) $0.2828 (subject to adjustment\nfor stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, recapitalizations or other similar events ) and (y) 20% of the “Minimum Price” (as defined in Nasdaq Stock Market\nRule 5635) on the date of the Nasdaq Stockholder Approval (as defined herein) (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, recapitalizations\nor other similar events) or, in any case, such lower amount as permitted, from time to time, by the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nThe Company may require holders to convert their Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock if the closing price of the Common Stock exceeds $8.00 per share\n(subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, recapitalizations or other similar events) for 20 consecutive trading days and the daily dollar\ntrading volume of the Common Stock exceeds $2,000,000 per day during the same period and certain equity conditions described in the Certificate of Designations are\nsatisfied.\nAt any time beginning 18 months from the date of the issuance, provided that certain equity conditions described in the Certificate of Designations are satisfied, and\nprovided further that the Company has filed all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to the Exchange Act on a timely basis for a continuous period of one year, the\nCompany has the right to redeem in cash all or some of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at such time at a redemption price equal to the product of (x)\n125% multiplied by (y) the sum of (A) the stated value of the Series A Preferred Stock plus (B) all declared and unpaid dividends on such Series A Preferred Stock and any\nother unpaid amounts then due and payable hereunder with respect to such Series A Preferred Stock, plus (C) the make-whole amount, plus (D) any accrued and unpaid late\ncharges with respect to such stated value and amounts payable pursuant to clause (B) as of such date of determination.\nOther than Scot Cohen, V4 Global LLC or their transferees, a holder of Series A Preferred Stock cannot convert shares of its Series A Preferred Stock into shares of\nCommon Stock if the holder and its affiliates would beneficially own more than 4.99%, or 9.99% at the election of the holder, of the outstanding Common Stock after\ngiving effect to the conversion. However, any holder may increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% upon notice to us, provided\nthat any increase in this limitation will not be effective until 61 days after such notice from the holder to us and such increase or decrease will apply only to the holder\nproviding such notice.\nExcept as required by law (including without limitation, the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”)), the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to\nvote with holders of the Common Stock on as as-converted basis, with the number of votes to which each holder of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to be calculated\nassuming a conversion price of $1.414 per share, which was the Minimum Price applicable immediately before the execution and delivery of the Series A Purchase\nAgreement, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations as set forth in the Certificate of Designations. To the extent that under the DGCL the vote of the holders of\nshares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class or series, as applicable, is required to authorize a given action of the Company, the affirmative vote or\nconsent of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together in the aggregate and not in separate series unless required under the DGCL,\nrepresented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present or by written consent of such majority (except as otherwise may be required under the DGCL) shall\nconstitute the approval of such action by both the class or the series, as applicable.\nOn August 19, 2024, the Company entered into an Amendment Agreement (the “Series A Amendment”) with the Required Holders (as defined in the Certificate of\nDesignations). Pursuant to the Series A Amendment, the Required Holders agreed that (A) the unpaid and accrued dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock due July 1,\n2024 (the “July Delinquent Dividend Amount”), shall be payable, at the option of the Company, in (i) cash and/or (ii) shares of Common Stock, at a price per share of\nCommon Stock equal to the lower of (x) $1.00 and (y) the Dividend Conversion Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), using July 1, 2024, as the applicable\ndate of determination in accordance with the Certificate of Designations; (B) the dividends due on October 1, 2024 (the “October Dividend Amount” and, together with the\nJuly Delinquent Dividend Amount, the “Delinquent Dividend Amounts”), shall be payable in shares of Common Stock based on a per share price of Common Stock equal to\n80% of the arithmetic average of the three (3) lowest closing sale prices of the Common Stock during the month of September 2024; and (C) such Delinquent Dividend\nAmounts and any Dividend Balance Shares (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), with respect thereto, if applicable, shall be delivered on October 1, 2024 and the\nPre-Dividend Shares (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) with respect to each of the July Delinquent Dividend Amount and the October Dividend Amount, if\napplicable, shall be delivered to the Series A Investors on or prior to the twenty-first (21st) trading day prior to October 1, 2024. The Company and the Required Holders\nfurther agreed pursuant to the Series A Amendment to amend (i) the Certificate of Designations, as described below, by filing a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate\nof Designations (the “Certificate of Amendment”) and (ii) the Series A Purchase Agreement to amend the definition of “Excluded Securities.”\n28\nThe Certificate of Amendment amended the Certificate of Designations to, among other things, (A) allow for the payment of dividends in the form of Common Stock to a\nholder of the Series A Preferred Stock who serves as a director, officer or employee of the Company; provided that such issuance is approved by the Company’s\nstockholders prior to such issuance, which was subsequently further amended by the October 2024 Certificate of Amendment (as defined below), (B) amend certain\nconditions required for (i) a mandatory conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii) the Company’s right to redeem, all or a portion, of the Series A Preferred Stock\noutstanding pursuant to an optional redemption, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designations, and (C) amend the definition of “Excluded Securities”\nto exclude Dividend Shares (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) and shares of Common Stock issued in connection with the payments of dividends. The\nCertificate of Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on August 23, 2024.\nOn October 14, 2024, the Company entered into an Amendment Agreement (the “October 2024 Series A Amendment”) with the Required Holders. Pursuant to the October\n2024 Series A Amendment, the Required Holders agreed to further amend the Certificate of Designations (the “October 2024 Certificate of Amendment”). Pursuant to the\nOctober 2024 Certificate of Amendment, (i) the Series A Preferred Stock is now entitled to voting rights as described therein, (ii) certain holders of the Preferred Stock are\nno longer subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations as described in the Certificate of Designations, and (iii) stockholder approval is no longer required in\nconnection with the payment of dividends in the form of Common Stock to a holder of the Series A Preferred Stock who serves as a director, officer or employee of the\nCompany. The October 2024 Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 14, 2024.\nThere is no established public trading market for the Series A Preferred Stock and we do not intend to list the Series A Preferred Stock on any national securities exchange\nor nationally recognized trading system.\nWarrants\nThe Company issued the Series A Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,896,553 shares of Common Stock. Each Series A Warrant has an exercise price of $1.45 per\nshare, became exercisable after the date that was six months from the date of issuance and will expire 5 years following the date of issuance. The exercise price is subject to\ncustomary adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, reclassifications and the like, and subject to price-based adjustment, on a “full ratchet” basis, in the event of any\nissuances of Common Stock, or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, at a price below the then-applicable exercise price (subject to certain\nexceptions).\nThere is no established public trading market for the Series A Warrants and we do not intend to list the Series A Warrants on any national securities exchange or nationally\nrecognized trading system.\nNasdaq Stockholder Approval\nThe Company’s ability to issue Conversion Shares and Series A Warrant Shares is subject to certain limitations set forth in the Certificate of Designations. Prior to receiving\nthe Nasdaq Stockholder Approval (as defined below), such limitations included a limit on the number of shares that may be issued until the time, if any, that the Company’s\nstockholders have approved the issuance of more than 19.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of Common Stock in accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq Stock\nMarket (the “Nasdaq Stockholder Approval”). Such Nasdaq Stockholder Approval was received at a special meeting of stockholders held on September 19, 2023.\nThe Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet financial guarantees or other off-balance sheet commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third\nparties.

BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe are a global public safety technology and services company that delivers safe and effective policing solutions to law enforcement and security personnel worldwide. We\nare leading the movement for safer outcomes by equipping law enforcement with safer, non-painful compliance tools, and immersive training fit for modern society. We\nbegan sales of our first public safety product, the BolaWrap 100 remote restraint device, in late 2018. In the first quarter of 2022, we delivered a new generation product, the\nBolaWrap 150. The BolaWrap 150 is electronically deployed and is more robust, smaller, lighter and simpler to deploy than the BolaWrap 100 that has since been phased\nout. In late 2020 we added a new solution to our public safety technologies, our virtual reality (“VR”) training platform, Wrap Reality, and in August 2023 we acquired\nIntrensic, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Intrensic”), which added a Body-Worn Camera (“BWC”) and Digital Evidence Management (“DEM”) solution to\nour portfolio of policing solutions. Wrap Reality is now sold to law enforcement agencies for simulation training as well as corrections departments for the societal reentry\nscenarios.\nOur target market for our solutions includes approximately 900,000 full-time sworn law enforcement officers in over 18,000 federal, state, and local law enforcement\nagencies in the U.S. and over 12 million police officers in more than 100 countries. Additionally, we are exploring opportunities in other domestic markets, such as military\nand private security. Our international focus is on countries with the largest police forces. According to 360iResearch, a market research consulting firm, our non-lethal\nproducts are part of a global market segment expected to grow to $16.1 billion by 2027.\nWe focus our efforts on the following products and services:\nBolaWrap Remote Restraint Device – a hand-held remote restraint device that discharges a seven and half-foot Kevlar tether to entangle an individual at a range of 10-25\nfeet. BolaWrap assists law enforcement to safely and effectively control encounters early without resorting to painful force options.\nWrap Reality – a law enforcement 3D training system employing immersive computer graphics VR with proprietary software-enabled content. It allows up to two\nparticipants to enter a simulated training environment simultaneously, and customized weapons controllers enable trainees to engage in strategic decision making along the\nforce continuum. Wrap Reality has 45 scenarios for law enforcement and corrections and 15 scenarios for societal reentry. Wrap Reality is one of the most robust 3D Virtual\nReality solutions on the market for law enforcement and societal reentry today.\nWrap Intrensic – a Body-Worn Camera and Digital Evidence Management solutions provider. BWC and DEM play crucial roles in capturing, storing, and managing digital\nevidence, such as video and audio recordings for various purposes, including criminal investigations and maintaining transparency in public interactions. The Wrap Intrensic\nX2 camera hardware and storage and data management capability, along with awareness of front-line operations, provides customers with a solution to meet their\nchallenges. Wrap Intrensic Evidence on our cloud-based video storage platform provides an unlimited video storage platform that includes video and other evidence\nuploading, search, retrieval, redaction, and evidence sharing while reducing the need for resources required to manage this evidence.\nIn addition to the US law enforcement market, we have shipped our restraint products to 62 countries. We have established an active distributor network representing 50\nstates and one dealer representing the US territory of Puerto Rico. We have distribution agreements with 35 international distributors covering 75 countries. We focus\nsignificant sales, training and business development efforts to support our distribution network in addition to our internal sales team.\nWe focus significant resources on research and development innovations and continue to enhance our products and plan to introduce new products. We believe we have\nestablished a strong brand and market presence globally and have established significant competitive advantages in our markets.\n- 2 -\nTable of Contents\nIndustry Background\nThe market for non-lethal and less-lethal products and devices serves law enforcement agencies, correctional facilities, military agencies, private security guard companies,\nand retail consumers. As thought leaders in new public safety products, we focus on the law enforcement agency segment of the market with our BolaWrap remote restraint\nsolution, Wrap Reality virtual reality system, and our Body-Worn Camera and Digital Evidence Management solutions. Recent trends, such as the rise in mental health\ncases, police reform, and reorganization of police departments, have started a growing conversation across the country on the need for de-escalation before applying a pain-\ncompliance policing policy. As this de-escalation movement unfolds, there are thousands of law enforcement, police, and sheriff’s offices focusing on training, policies, and\nthe use of more non-lethal restraining solutions. This movement highlights a growing need for new approaches, which we believe will drive demand for our innovative and\nsafe law enforcement solutions.\nWhen law enforcement seeks to detain an individual, there usually is a use of force continuum that an agency follows, starting with officer presence and verbal commands.\nIf verbal commands break down, agencies may authorize the use of less lethal pain inducing compliance tools, such as pepper spray, pepper ball, wooden batons or metal\ncollapsible batons, launchers and bean bags, and conducted energy weapons, such as Taser®. Our BolaWrap product offers an alternative. It can be used in many cases to\nrestrain an individual after verbal commands break down and prior to the need to use pain-inducing compliance tools. The use of nonlethal solutions like BolaWrap\npotentially could lead to a reduction in use of force incidents that result in ending careers as well as the number of legal cases filed against agencies for excessive use of\nforce, wrongful death, and injury, thus decreasing expensive litigation, settlements, and insurance costs.\nWe anticipate that use of the BolaWrap by public safety agencies can increase goodwill between public safety agencies and their communities, especially in a time when\ninteractions with public safety officers are increasingly subject to public and media scrutiny. We believe the law enforcement community’s response to BolaWrap\ndemonstrates the need for the product and its utility in safely detaining individuals. Our goal is to equip every public safety officer with a BolaWrap remote restraint\nsolution that they carry with them each day.\nMarkets\nWe participate in the global non-lethal market that, according to the January 2022 report by 360iResearch, was expected to grow to $16.1 billion by 2027. The following\nsegments are our target markets:\nDomestic and International Law Enforcement\nOur products and services are primarily targeted at federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in the U.S. As of 2018, there were over 18,000 law enforcement\nagencies and 800,000 full-time local and state law enforcement officers in the US, while the US Department of Justice reported over 100,000 full-time federal officers based\non 2016 data. Our product line, including BolaWrap, can be an effective tool for safe detention of individuals under the jurisdiction of these agencies.\nWe have also identified an international market opportunity of over 12.1 million police officers in the 100 largest police forces outside the US. We have delivered products\nto 62 countries and have entered into agreements with international distributors, with international sales representing a significant portion of our revenues in 2023. We\nanticipate that sales attributable to international markets will continue to represent a significant portion of our sales in the future due in part to the centralized purchase\ndecision-making process at the national level in these markets. Often, the international markets have large national police forces. Conversely, in the US, the market is more\nfragmented with many smaller agencies and longer procurement and sales cycles. We expect international sales to continue to be lumpy due the timing of purchase decisions\nand relatively large size of orders.\nCorrectional Facilities\nIn 2019, the US Bureau of Justice statistics (“Census of State and Federal Correctional Facilities, 2019,” US Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, published\nNovember 2022) estimated that there were 240,000 correctional officers in over 1,000 federal and state correctional facilities in the U.S., representing a large potential\nmarket for our products and services. Most correctional facilities fall under federal, state or local law enforcement jurisdiction and we believe these facilities could leverage\nWrap Reality for law enforcement and societal reentry platforms as well as BolaWrap inside and outside of the correctional facility.\nPrivate Security Firms and Guard Services\nAccording to the 2019 Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates (“Occupational Employment Statistics,” US Department of Labor), there were 1.1 million privately employed\nsecurity guards in the U.S. They represent a broad range of individuals, including those employed by investigation and security services, hospitals, schools, local\ngovernment, and others. We believe that the use of BolaWrap by security personnel could effectively de-escalate some encounters without eliminating other devices\navailable today. Providing security personnel with the BolaWrap may also reduce the potential liability of private security companies and personnel in such encounters.\n- 3 -\nTable of Contents\nToday, ATF classifications play a role in restricting Wrap's ability to transfer easily to non-government security firms. We believe the classification is overly onerous and we\nwill continue to work with the ATF and others to change our nonlethal product's classification. It is important to note that countries in which we have international\ncustomers do not have any transfer or possession restrictions on the non-lethal BolaWrap devices and we believe this should be the future for BolaWrap in the United States.\nVirtual Reality Training Market\nThe virtual training and simulation market is projected to reach $602 billion by 2027, according to a 2019 report by Allied Market Research. We expect the growth of virtual\nreality and simulation to continue expanding into many nascent industries, including law enforcement, corrections, military, school, and private security although it\ncurrently represents a relatively small segment of the overall market. The law enforcement and military sectors are important segments of the market, and increasing\nawareness of the benefits of virtual training and simulation is driving market growth. Advancements in technology now enable virtual reality to recreate real-world scenarios\nin a 360-degree immersive environment.\nWrap Products and Services\nBolaWrap Remote Restraint\nOur BolaWrap product line includes the BolaWrap 100, which was our first remote restraint product and which has been phased out, and the BolaWrap 150, delivered to the\nmarket in the first quarter of 2022. The BolaWrap 150 offers electronic deployment and is more robust, smaller, lighter, and simpler to use than the BolaWrap 100. The\nBolaWrap is a handheld remote restraint device that discharges a seven and a half-foot Kevlar tether, entangling an individual from a range of 10-25 feet. Developed in\ncollaboration with law enforcement professionals, this device enables safe and effective control of low-force encounters, providing a valuable tool for law enforcement\nofficers.\n- 4 -\nTable of Contents\nThe BolaWrap is a remote restraint device that safely wraps around an individual's arms and/or legs to impede movement and prevent harm to themselves or others. The\ndevice provides a valuable tool for law enforcement officers to safely and humanely take subjects into custody without injury, especially when verbal commands are\nineffective.\nWith a wide effectiveness zone and a guiding seven dot green laser for accurate placement of the Kevlar tether, the BolaWrap mitigates the risk of injury to the subject,\nofficer and potential bystanders. Its small, light, and rugged design allows officers to maintain other use of force continuum options while providing a non-lethal alternative\nto potentially injurious less-lethal forces or firearms.\nBolaWrap's effectiveness in restraining individuals and hindering their ability to flee or fight has been proven. Not only does it allow officers to act safely and effectively in\ndifficult situations by minimizing the need for other uses of force, including hand-to-hand combat and other more injurious less lethal or lethal weapons, but also it helps\nminimize injury and prevent a force frenzy that can occur after chasing a fleeing subject.\nUnlike other less-lethal tools that rely on pain compliance and may lead to escalation of incidents and serious injuries, the BolaWrap does not rely on pain or electricity-\nenabled neuromuscular incapacitation. BolaWrap does not induce paralyzed falls or recovery time, making the BolaWrap an ideal non-lethal tool for law enforcement\nofficers. Additionally, the fight or flight response that comes from less lethal tools that cause pain and injury is minimized by being wrapped by a BolaWrap device.\nWe spend significant resources training law enforcement on the safe and effective use of the BolaWrap in conjunction with de-escalation and apprehension techniques.\nHowever, like any restraining action, some injuries may result from the use of BolaWrap. Our training includes primary use cases that fall into the three broad categories\nroutinely encountered by law enforcement and security personnel:\n● To remotely restrain and limit the mobility of an individual who is experiencing a mental health crisis, narcotics-induced psychosis, or other crisis condition\nrendering them incapable of responding to law enforcement’s verbal commands but that presents a danger to law enforcement, the public or themselves if not\nrestrained;\n● To remotely restrain and limit the mobility of an individual attempting to evade arrest or questioning, as well as individuals ignoring verbal commands from law\nenforcement. These individuals are commonly referred to as passively resistant or non-compliant; and\n● To assist in subduing individuals actively resisting arrest by limiting mobility, possibly making other engagement options less risky to officers and less injurious to\nindividuals.\nLaw enforcement encounters involving individuals experiencing a behavioral health crisis can be challenging, resulting in public controversy and costly consequences. The\nTreatment Advocacy Center: Office of Research & Public Affairs reported that one in ten police encounters involve individuals with mental illness, with at least one in four\nfatal police encounters involving individuals with mental illness (Overlooked in the Undercounted: The Role of Mental Illness in Fatal Law Enforcement Encounters\n(2015)).\nA field deployment should be considered successful by law enforcement agencies if compliance is achieved, and no additional higher-level use of force tool is required after\nthe BolaWrap is displayed or used. Agencies have reported achieving compliance by utilizing the BolaWrap in the following ways:\n● by pointing the BolaWrap’s seven dot green line dot laser at the suspect in conjunction with verbal commands;\n● by the sound emitted by the BolaWrap upon deployment and causing a distraction;\n● through the feeling of being wrapped and/or the restraint of the Kevlar cord around the suspect’s legs, arms, or torso; and\n● when used in conjunction with other less-lethal tools.\n- 5 -\nTable of Contents\nWhile we encourage all law enforcement agencies to fill out a Use of Device Report when the BolaWrap is used during an encounter in the field, agencies do not always\nreport all field deployments. Some agencies consider the deployment of the BolaWrap to be a non-use of force or a de minimis use of force that does not require any\nreporting. While some deployments have been captured on bodycam and shared with the public, others were reported by the agency or the media but were not captured on\nbodycam. Some agencies capture deployments on body worn cameras but do not allow the sharing of the video or allow them to be shared for learning purposes but not\npublicized for other marketing purposes. Some local jurisdictions have department policies, collective bargaining agreements, and city, county or state laws regarding the\ndistribution of body worn camera video.\nAs more agencies incorporate the BolaWrap onto their duty belts and carry it every day on shift we expect to see an increase in the rate of field deployments, which we\nbelieve will contribute to even further adoption of the device by law enforcement agencies worldwide. In 2022, following the release of our strategic roadmap in mid 2022\nQ3, we focused our customer service team on modifying their approach to become a customer success operation. As part of this strategic change, our team focuses on\nreaching out to drive agency wide adoption. We made this pivot in part because many agencies in the first few years of BolaWrap only deployed a small number of trial\nunits without the immediate follow-up to grow their deployment to agency-wide. We have trained our sales team to focus on agency-wide deployment to drive the highest\nlevel of immediate success with the device and to integrate it into department-wide use of force polices. In January 2023, we launched our Use of Force Reduction\nGuarantee whereby we will buy back an agency’s devices when they deploy agency wide and do not see a reduction in Use –of -Force by at least 10%, after meeting certain\ncriteria.\nBolaWrap 150\nIn late Q1 2022, we delivered the latest generation of our BolaWrap device, the BolaWrap 150. Production of the previous model, the BolaWrap 100, ceased in 2021. We\nintend to continue to supply cartridges for the BolaWrap 100 to our customers for the foreseeable future. Unlike the BolaWrap 100, the BolaWrap 150 utilizes cassettes that\nare unique to the device and cannot be interchanged between models. We have positioned the BolaWrap 150 as our primary product and plan to support it for 5 to 10 years\nfrom the product launch date.\nTo support the increased production volume for the BolaWrap 150, we implemented a more automated supply chain in the production, quality control, and testing lines in\n2022.\nWe believe the BolaWrap 150 offers important benefits, including:\n● Modern electronic deployment\n● Smaller size and less weight\n● Reduced production costs\n● LED status indicator for ease of operation\n● Long laser battery life\n● LED target illumination to improve accuracy\n● Hardened plastic for increased durability\n● Enhanced water resistance for harsh environments\nThe BolaWrap 150 employs two micro-gas generators to individually expel each entangling projectile. Micro-gas generators are micro explosive parts used in a variety of\nindustrial products, including automobile airbags.\nSee “Risk Factors” included below in this Annual Report for additional information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with our business.\n- 6 -\nTable of Contents\nWrap Reality\nIn 2019, we partnered with an independent technology company to create a virtual reality system with training scenarios. We acquired NSENA Inc. in December 2020, a\nprovider of law enforcement training employing immersive computer graphics virtual reality with proprietary software-enabled content. We branded the system as Wrap\nReality Virtual Training and kept building and improving that platform and today it offers 38 built out scenarios targeting law enforcement. Countless additional scenarios\ncan be made by using the Wrap Reality adapt functionality to pick and choose key components to build a scenario. It takes advantage of advanced virtual reality hardware\nand allows up to two participants to enter the simulated training environment simultaneously.\nIn August 2021, we announced the development of an expanded Wrap Reality Virtual Training platform through a collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS). This\nnew platform combines our law enforcement simulator with secure cloud services to track training progress and provide the ability to replay recorded training sessions. We\ncontinue to upgrade scenarios and develop de-escalation techniques into new scenarios and seek to enhance the Wrap Reality experience through continued software and\nplatform innovation.\nWe are optimistic about the potential for future growth of WRAP Reality by public safety agencies, given our early adoption and deployment of robust virtual reality\ntraining technology. By leveraging our existing platform and our investment in cloud software, we now will have the opportunity to develop and offer critical training\nscenarios at very competitive price points.\nWe have the ability to offer both on-premises and full cloud capabilities with multiple hardware options. This expansion enables us to deliver the platform to a broad range\nof customers, including law enforcement agencies, public and private security, corrections and the general public for firearms, concealed weapon, and safety training.\n- 7 -\nTable of Contents\nWrap Intensic\nIn August 2023, Wrap entered into the Intrensic Purchase Agreement (as defined herein) for the acquisition of Intrensic, an innovator of DEMS and body-worn cameras.\nThe integration of Intrensic’s offerings into the Company’s product suite allows the Company to expand its relationship with existing customers, increase its addressable\nmarket, and further innovate its technology offering. The acquisition helps the Company broaden its addressable market by appealing to a wider range of law enforcement\nand public safety agencies that are looking for integrated solutions combining non-lethal devices and digital evidence management. By offering a more comprehensive set\nof tools and technologies, the Company strengthened its position in the public safety technology market by differentiating itself from competitors that only offer single\nsolutions.\nWrap Intrensic offers a robust digital evidence management platform that enables law enforcement agencies to securely store, manage, and share digital evidence, including\nbody-worn camera footage, dashboard camera videos, and other digital files. The platform is equipped with features such as secure cloud storage, easy file retrieval,\nevidence tagging, chain of custody documentation, and sharing capabilities to streamline workflows and ensure data integrity. Wrap Intrensic also provides body-worn\ncamera solutions designed to capture high-quality video evidence in various law enforcement scenarios. These cameras feature HD recording, night vision, and secure data\nupload capabilities and seamlessly integrate with the digital evidence management platform for efficient video uploading and management.\nSince completing the acquisition in August 2023, Wrap has launched a host of new features and functionality to the Intrensic platform including WrapAI, a suite of artificial\nintelligence-powered functionality for Wrap Intrensic BWC and DEMS. This suite includes AI video redaction, AI video transcription, and AI assisted contextual content\nsearch, keeping Wrap Intrensic on the cutting edge of innovation in the DEMS and BWC marketplace.\nBy offering comprehensive solutions for video evidence management, Wrap Intrensic enhances accountability and transparency within law enforcement agencies. The\ntechnology facilitates improved documentation of interactions and incidents, which is critical in investigations and when building public trust. The solutions are used in\nvarious settings, including routine patrols, traffic stops, and large-scale public events. Wrap Intrensic's platform simplifies digital evidence management, reducing the\nadministrative burden on law enforcement personnel. Secure cloud storage and rigorous chain-of-custody protocols protect digital evidence against unauthorized access and\ntampering. The integration of non-lethal tools like BolaWrap with digital evidence solutions contributes to safer interactions between law enforcement officers and the\ncommunity, strengthening Wrap Technologies' position in the public safety technology market by offering an end-to-end solution that combines innovative de-escalation\ndevices with state-of-the-art evidence management.\n- 8 -\nTable of Contents\nThe Company remains optimistic on the outlook of Wrap Intrensic as a competitive and innovative solution set in the marketplace.\nSelling, Marketing and Training\nOur sales, marketing and training organizations work together closely to drive revenue growth by enhancing market awareness of our solutions, generating leads, building a\nstrong sales pipeline, and cultivating customer and distributor relationships. Our training not only supports our sales, but it also provides revenue due to the extreme value\nour customers place on our training services. We started charging for our training services in the third quarter of 2022.\nSales\nOur primary target market is law enforcement agencies in the US and globally. The purchasing decision for our BolaWrap products and accessories is typically made by a\ngroup including agency heads, procurement, training staff, and use of force experts, and may involve political decision-makers such as city council members. The decision-\nmaking process may take several weeks to over a year due to budget constraints and other considerations.\nWe use product demonstrations as a primary sales tool and follow up with sales activities. Our goal is to convert demonstration and training deliveries into sales and long-\nterm expansion. We provide fee-based training services to agencies, as we believe that departments with knowledgeable instructors are more likely to purchase our products.\nIn 2019, we adopted a channel distribution approach, in tandem with our internal sales team, where we supply our products to independent regional police equipment\ndistributors, who in turn sell to local law enforcement agencies. Our current focus is on cultivating partnerships with major agencies and providing active assistance to our\ndistributors through our dedicated sales, business development, and support teams. We sell through distributors in most cases and go direct to our end customers where the\nright distributor skill set, and capability is not available.\nWe currently have distribution agreements with a network of distributors representing 50 states and one dealer representing Puerto Rico. These agreements provide certain\nterritorial rights to distributors and allow us to sell direct to certain agencies under certain terms.\nWe have distribution agreements with 35 international distributors covering 75 countries. These agreements generally require minimum sales and follow up performance\nand allow us to sell direct to customers if performance is not being met. We focus significant sales and business development efforts to support our international distributors.\nWe have invested in training our sales, distribution, demonstration, training, and customer success teams, as well as our distributors, to build awareness and drive sales of\nour BolaWrap and our Wrap Reality virtual reality training product. Additionally, we are actively seeking partnerships with other organizations to further enhance our sales,\nmarketing, and technology efforts. We engage with other industry experts to ensure our virtual reality scenarios align with industry standards of engagement.\nMarketing\nProspective customers become aware of Wrap solutions through a variety of marketing channels such as social media, paid advertising, media coverage, press releases, web\nsearches, sales calls, and public relations. We also distribute body and dash camera videos of successful BolaWrap use in policing encounters to generate leads. Once a lead\nis generated, it is qualified by our inside sales team, and a sales representative or distributor communicates with the prospective customer to discuss their needs and the\nsolutions we offer.\nWe track our marketing and sales activities to provide immediate insight into activities, leads, quotes, and pipeline opportunities. Our marketing staff engages with law\nenforcement agencies, personnel, and risk management organizations to educate them on the benefits of BolaWrap remote restraint, as well as Wrap Reality and we\nparticipate in various domestic and international trade shows and conferences to promote our brands. We intend to increase the use of our trademarks throughout our product\ndistribution chain to enhance brand awareness and believe our strong reputation as a pioneer in remote restraint, with excellent training and product support, gives us a\ncompetitive edge.\n- 9 -\nTable of Contents\nDemonstration, Training and Customer Success\nAs part of its sales and marketing activities, the Company has a department dedicated to conducting demonstrations and training. The Company offers in-person, webinar,\nand online demonstrations, as well as paid use of force and de-escalation training, to law enforcement agencies. The training can take place before or after the initial or\nsubsequent purchase or deployment of the Company's products. The Company believes that providing training and demonstrations to law enforcement officers and trainers\nincreases their support for purchasing and deploying the products within their departments.\nGenerally, agencies will adapt their use of force policy to incorporate remote restraint and the BolaWrap into a key new area of their policy for non-invasive tools that often\ndid not previously exist. BolaWrap is typically not a categorical use of force, or if classified as force, and is typically at the lowest level on a department policy, below all\nother less lethal weapons like pepper spray, pepperball, batons, bean bags, Tasers® and conducted energy weapons.\nIn order to provide comprehensive training and sales support, we initiated the Wrap “Train the Trainer” program in October 2018. The program is structured such that our\nMaster BolaWrap Instructors educate BolaWrap Instructors at local agencies, who then train front-line officers in compliance with the agency's policies.\nBolaWrap Instructors are typically sworn law enforcement officers, who are commonly department trainers, defensive tactic instructors, or SWAT officers. They undergo a\nfive-hour BolaWrap Instructor certification course, which includes passing a written exam and demonstrating proficiency in deploying and using the BolaWrap. We provide\nsupport to the instructors to share lessons learned and best practices for teaching line officers in the use of BolaWrap. Instructor certification is valid for two years and\nrequires renewal afterward. BolaWrap training curriculum is submitted by departments to their Post Officers Standards and Training (POST) for credit for in-service\ntraining hours. Most departments who leverage the BolaWrap across all field officers incorporate BolaWrap training into most other training materials and in service\ntraining throughout the year. An example would be officers doing an in-service training on Driving under the Influence (DUI) arrests using the BolaWrap during the arrest\nportion of training on individuals under the influence of alcohol or drugs. If departments are conducting in-service training on responding to those in a mental health crisis,\nthey also need to train and have ongoing practice on deploying BolaWrap on those in crisis and practice taking these individuals safely into protective custody. Another in\nservice training example would be when departments practice warrant service, and during the arrest and apprehension efforts, they leverage BolaWrap after verbal\ncommands breakdown but before they are justified in using pain compliance tools such as pepper spray, pepperball, batons, Tasers or conducted electrical weapons.\nIn order to schedule and organize training events, registration, and training records, we utilize a cloud-based software system called the Wrap Learning Management\nSystem. This system is also home to a Resource Library which we highly encourage distributors and purchasers to use to educate themselves on the use of BolaWrap.\nIn the modern world of policing, we understand that it is crucial to provide equipment and services that are well-supported, and that officers receive proper training and\nprocedures to perform their duties effectively and safely. As a result, we have developed a professional team dedicated to training and sales support, as well as the necessary\nsystems to provide this support. This approach not only gives us a competitive edge but also creates a significant barrier to new competition. We are confident that our\ntraining and support teams are equipped to assist agencies of all sizes.\nOur Strategy\nIn the world of law enforcement, defense, public safety, and security, our product and training solutions are gaining recognition and worldwide awareness. We have a strong\nglobal brand and product foundation that we are continuously expanding to reach new markets and customers, thereby contributing to significant business growth. We are\nconfident that we can capitalize on the growing demand for non-lethal policing in the world, particularly as non-compliant individuals continue to pose a threat. Our training\nprograms and virtual reality platform are also well positioned to grow rapidly in global markets.\nOur commercialization strategy concentrates on the immediately addressable domestic market, comprising more than 18,000 federal, state, and local law enforcement\nagencies, with approximately 900,000 full-time sworn officers in just the US alone. We also aim to target the 100 largest police forces internationally, which have over 12\nmillion police officers. Our objective is to unlock the full potential of our technology solutions suite, which targets law enforcement and security personnel on a global\nscale.\nWe plan to maintain financial prudence and deliver value to our shareholders. Our focus will remain on expanding our revenues through pursuing business opportunities\nboth domestically and internationally. In addition to enhancing our current product portfolio, we aim to develop new and improved products, which can be utilized by\nsecurity personnel and related professionals. We also seek to pursue strategic business initiatives and collaborations, including potential acquisitions, to complement our\nexisting offerings and sales network.\n- 10 -\nTable of Contents\nManufacturing and Suppliers\nManufacturing\nWe believe that maintaining scalable assembly capabilities is crucial to the performance of our products and the growth of our business. Our assembly processes involve\nunique systems and materials, and we contract with third-party suppliers to produce various parts, components, and subassemblies. We established initial startup production\nin Las Vegas in 2018, and in October 2019, we completed a move to and began production at our current facility in Arizona. In this facility, we perform manufacturing, final\nassembly, testing, and shipping of our products. We have refined our internal processes to improve how we design, test, and qualify products, and we continue to implement\nrigorous manufacturing and quality processes to track production and field issues. We periodically implement design and component changes to reduce our product costs\nand improve product reliability and manufacturability. We aim to continually improve our operations to meet the growing demand for our products and better serve our\ncustomers.\nSuppliers\nWe have established strong relationships with our key suppliers, and their timely and reliable delivery is crucial to our ability to meet customer demand. However, we are\nsubject to challenges in our global supply chain, such as component shortages, increased lead times, cost fluctuations, and logistics constraints, which can affect our\nproduction schedules and have a negative impact on our financial performance. In late 2022, we started to ensure we have more final product inventory on hand to meet new\nbusiness needs. While we anticipate supply chain challenges to improve in the remainder of 2024, we recognize that future supplier shortages and logistics issues could have\na material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nBacklog\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had backlog of approximately $209 thousand that was delivered in the first quarter of 2024. The amount of backlog at any point in time is\ndependent upon order timing, scheduled delivery dates to our customers and product lead times. Most orders are shipped shortly after order and backlog is typically\nassociated with larger police agency orders. Because of our history of shipping shortly after order, we do not currently believe backlog at any period end is predictive of\nfuture order volume or revenues beyond the reported amount. Distributor and customer orders for future deliveries are generally subject to modification, rescheduling or in\nsome instances, cancellation in the normal course of business.\nWarranties\nOur products come with a warranty that guarantees their quality and performance for up to one year from the date of purchase. This warranty is generally limited and may\ninclude certain shipping costs for the customer. We also offer the option for our customers to purchase additional one-year warranty increments for their products.\nCompetition\nThe Company positions the BolaWrap product as a new non-invasive remote restraint solution for law enforcement rather than a replacement for other devices currently in\nuse. When looking at the use of force continuum, we place our solution in a category completely separate from common less lethal solutions that use pain compliance and\ncan cause serious injuries or even death in some circumstances. We believe every law enforcement officer in the world who carries handcuffs should carry a BolaWrap at\nthe same time as BolaWrap is leveraged just prior to handcuffs.\nHowever, we do compete with other use of force products for budget allocations. The BolaWrap product may also be perceived as an alternative to other solutions despite\nour valuable and separate positioning. Because we believe the BolaWrap may be used more often than certain other tools given, we expect to stand in a category of our own.\nMany agencies with the BolaWrap do not consider it a use-of-force tool, which uniquely distinguishes it from every other tool on an officer's belt. The most common\ninteractions officers have with the public revolve around de-escalating situations. In such scenarios, the BolaWrap stands out as one of the safest de-escalation tool\navailable. Given these factors, we believe the BolaWrap may be used more often than certain other tools, positioning us to be widely recognized as standing in a category of\nour own.\n- 11 -\nTable of Contents\nIndirectly, other use of force devices such as tasers (CEWs), pepper spray, pepperball, batons, and impact weapons may try to compete with the BolaWrap product.\nHowever, many law enforcement personnel consider these to be distinct tools, each best-suited to a particular set of higher use of force circumstances. Purchasing one tool\ndoes not preclude the purchase of others, but budgetary considerations and space limitations on officer’s belts may limit the number of devices purchased and carried. The\nBolaWrap's unique remote restraint use, effectiveness, and low possibility of injury positions it as an effective competitor against all other alternatives. We believe that in\ntime the non-invasive BolaWrap will be prioritized over these other less lethal devices for its ease of use, safety, and high probability of use throughout a given year to\nofficers in the field.\nIn the virtual reality training space, there are numerous competitors offering simulators for law enforcement, including established video-based 2D simulators. Furthermore,\nother virtual reality providers and developers focused on other applications may choose to compete in the law enforcement training market in the future.\nWe recognize that some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to devote to compete in the law enforcement market and may introduce products with\nfeatures and performance competitive to our product. However, we believe that our unique positioning, strong product and technology foundation, and dedicated\nprofessional training and sales support team provide a competitive advantage.\nOverall, we believe that the depth and capability of our 3D Virtual Reality (VR) Wrap Reality Capability will prove to be impressive. We have 38 fully formed law\nenforcement scenarios and 25 corrections and societal reentry scenarios in 3D in addition to the customizability of Wrap Reality Adapt which we believe provides more\nrobust 3D options than our competitors. The largest capitalized competitor in this space currently offers only three 3D scenarios and is selling subscriptions of more than six\nmillion dollars a year.\nGovernment Regulation\nAs a global company, we are subject to a wide range of domestic, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, as well as international laws and regulations regarding\nshipments, customs, import, export, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, and hazardous substances disposal. Compliance with these\nlaws and regulations may entail significant costs, and failure to comply may result in penalties or other enforcement actions.\nOur BolaWrap products are classified as firearms and AOWs by the ATF, and we hold the necessary licenses to manufacture and deal in such firearms. We believe these\ndevices have been classified as AOW due to the lack of updates to outdated statutes and firearms regulations. We are actively working to improve the legislation and to\nallow our products to be directly transferred to private security forces and private individuals due to its safe effective capabilities standing alone in the non-invasive non-\nlethal category.\nWe are also subject to state and international regulations, which may vary. We comply with shipping regulations for dangerous goods, and our products comply with\nstandard safety requirements in the US and international markets. We follow data protection laws and have a privacy policy in place. We work with distributors and advisors\nfamiliar with applicable import regulations in our international markets.\nIntellectual Property Rights and Proprietary Information\nWe have a policy of protecting our intellectual property assets, which include issued domestic and international patents, pending patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade\nsecrets, and contractual obligations. We enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and third parties to whom we disclose\nproprietary information. These agreements prohibit disclosure of confidential information both during and after the duration of the working relationship. However, we\nrecognize that such agreements may not always prevent disclosure or provide adequate remedies for any breach. We rely on copyrights, trade secrets, and other proprietary\nrights to protect the content of our training services, including the Wrap Reality VR training software and content.\nWe believe that strong product offerings that are continually upgraded and enhanced, combined with factors such as innovation, technological expertise, and experienced\npersonnel, will keep us competitive. Therefore, we seek patent and other intellectual property protection on important technological improvements that we make. Before\nfiling for patents, we disclose key features to patent counsel and maintain these features as trade secrets prior to product introduction. However, patent applications may not\nresult in issued patents covering all important claims, and there is a risk that they could be denied in their entirety.\nWe currently have twenty-two issued US patents related to the BolaWrap technology and six additional US patents pending. In September 2018, we commenced filing our\nforeign patent applications selectively targeting the members of the European Patent Office (39 countries) and seventeen other countries, of which forty-five patents have\nbeen issued to date. To date we have a total of sixty-seven issued domestic and international patents for our small global company. During 2023 we filed nine patent\napplications, seven of which were US filings. We feel the investment in patent protection in the US and abroad strengthens our intellectual property and creates value in\nWrap Technologies. The failure to obtain patent protection or the loss of patent protection on our existing and future technologies or the circumvention of our patents by\ncompetitors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete successfully.\n- 12 -\nTable of Contents\nWe have been granted trade name protection for “BolaWrap” and “Wrap” in multiple countries and expect to employ a combination of registered and common law trade\nnames, trademarks and service marks in our business. We rely on a variety of intellectual property protections for our products and technologies, including contractual\nobligations, and we intend to pursue a policy of vigorously enforcing such rights.\nThe law enforcement product and services industries are characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Others, including\nacademic institutions and competitors, hold numerous patents in less lethal and related technologies. Although we are not aware of any existing patents that would\nmaterially inhibit our ability to commercialize our technology, others may assert claims in the future. Such claims, with or without merit, may have a material adverse effect\non our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development initiatives are led by our internal personnel and make use of specialized consultants when necessary. These initiatives include basic research,\nmechanical and electrical engineering design and testing. Future development projects will focus on new versions of the BolaWrap technology, virtual reality and new\npublic safety technologies that focus on safe and effective policing, especially in our strategic space that does not use pain compliance.\nFor the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, we spent approximately $3.3 million and $5.1 million, respectively, on company-sponsored research and\ndevelopment. This equates to 53% of revenue in 2023 and 63% of revenue in 2022. Future levels of research and development expenditure will vary depending on the\ntiming of further new product development and the availability of funds to carry on new and additional research and development on currently owned technologies or in\nother areas. During 2024, in addition to continued development and enhancement of our remote restraint products, we expect to incur additional costs improving our\ntraining systems including enhancing our Wrap Reality on premise and cloud platforms and related content. As mentioned earlier we believe we are ahead of many in the\nlaw enforcement 3D virtual reality training space and have built up significant capability to compete globally in the law enforcement and corrections VR space.\nRelated Party License and Royalties\nWe are obligated to pay royalties pursuant to an exclusive Amended and Restated Intellectual Property License Agreement (the “License Agreement”), dated as of\nSeptember 30, 2016, with Syzygy Licensing, LLC (“Syzygy”), a private technology invention, consulting and licensing company owned and controlled by Elwood G.\nNorris, a founder and former officer and current stockholder of the Company, and James A. Barnes, a former officer and stockholder of the Company. Syzygy has no\nongoing operations, and does not engage in any manufacturing, production or other related activities.\nThe License Agreement provides for the payment of royalties of 4% of revenue from products employing the licensed device technology up to the earlier to occur of (i) the\npayment by the Company of an aggregate of $1.0 million in royalties, or (ii) September 30, 2026. All development and patent costs have been paid by us and patent\napplications and the technology related to the BolaWrap 100 and the BolaWrap 150 have been completely and solely assigned to the Company, subject to this royalty\nobligation. As of December 31, 2023, $919 thousand has been paid out under this royalty obligation, leaving a maximum of $81 thousand to be paid out in the future.\nSeasonality\nLocal and international law enforcement has seasonality with respect to when they purchase and expend funds. Many local law enforcement agencies in the US are on a July\n1 to June 30 calendar year resulting in increased spending in the third and fourth quarter of the fiscal year. The US federal government is on an October 1 to September 30\nbudget year, resulting in use or lose spending that often occurs in in the third quarter of the fiscal year. Some domestic and international budgets are on a calendar fiscal year\nresulting in the fourth quarter typically being the largest buying quarter of the year.\nFinancial Information about Customer Concentration and Geographic Areas\nFinancial information regarding customer concentration and geographic areas in which we operate is contained in Note 18.\n- 13 -\nTable of Contents\nEmployees\nWe employ 52 full-time employees with 50 in the U.S. and two located in the United Kingdom. In addition to our two executive officers, we had 20 personnel engaged in\nsales, marketing, sales support and training, 12 in production, seven in research and development and 10 in administration. In addition, we engage consultants from time to\ntime to provide additional sales, marketing, training and research and development services, and anticipate engaging consultants going forward to supplement our full- and\npart-time personnel.\nIn our commitment to operational excellence and maintaining a favorable employer reputation, we strive to create a work environment that attracts, develops, and retains the\nbest talents in the industry. Our employees are offered an engaging work experience that contributes to their professional growth and career advancement. We acknowledge\nthat the success of our business is dependent on the collective talents and dedication of our employees, and we are committed to investing in their professional growth and\nsuccess.\nAvailable Information\nAs a public company, we are required to file our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements on Schedule\n14A and other information (including any amendments) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains\nreports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. You can find our SEC filings at the SEC’s website at\nwww.sec.gov.\nOur Internet address is www.wrap.com. Information contained on our website is not part of this Annual Report. Our SEC filings (including any amendments) are also made\navailable free of charge on www.wrap.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our Company involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information included in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the\nfollowing risk factors in evaluating an investment in our Company. You should consider these matters in conjunction with the other information included or incorporated by\nreference in this Annual Report. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue, and future\nprospects could be negatively impacted. In that event, the market price of our Common Stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of operating losses, expect additional losses and may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have a history of operating losses and expect to incur additional losses until we achieve sufficient revenue and resulting margins to offset our operating costs. Our net\nloss for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $30.2 million and $17.6 million, respectively. Our increase in net losses in 2023 was primarily attributable to a\nnon-cash charge of approximately $12.0 million related to the change in value of our warrant liability initially recorded as part of the preferred stock issuance in July\n2023.Our ability to achieve future profitability is dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Failure to achieve profitability or sustain\nprofitability, if achieved, may require us to raise additional capital, which could have a material negative impact on the market value of our Common Stock.\nWe may need additional capital to execute our business plan, and raising additional capital, if possible, by issuing additional equity securities may cause dilution to\nexisting stockholders. In addition, raising additional capital by issuing additional debt instruments may restrict our operations.\nAlthough we believe we have adequate financial resources to fund our operations and capital needs for at least the next twelve months, and that we may be able to generate\nfunds from product sales during that time, existing working capital may not be sufficient to achieve profitable operations due to product introduction costs, operating losses\nand other factors. Principal factors affecting the availability of internally generated funds include:\n● failure of product sales and services to meet planned projections;\n● government spending levels impacting sales of our products;\n● working capital requirements to support business growth;\n- 14 -\nTable of Contents\n● our ability to integrate acquisitions;\n● our ability to control spending;\n● our ability to collect accounts receivable; and\n● acceptance of our products and services in planned markets.\nIn the event we are required to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be\ndiluted significantly, and such newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. In addition, the issuance of any\nequity securities could be at a discount to the market price.\nIf we incur debt financing, the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness may limit funds available for our business activities, and we could be subject to\ncovenants that restrict our ability to operate our business and make distributions to our stockholders. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional\nborrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem stock or make investments. There is\nno assurance that any equity or debt financing transaction will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nAs a result of our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter\nended March 31, 2024 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we are currently ineligible to file a registration statement on Form\nS-3, which may impair our ability to raise capital on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner or at all.\nForm S-3 permits eligible issuers to conduct registered offerings using a short form registration statement that allows the issuer to incorporate by reference its past and\nfuture filings and reports made under the Exchange Act. In addition, Form S-3 enables eligible issuers to conduct primary offerings “off the shelf” under Rule 415 of the\nSecurities Act. The shelf registration process, combined with the ability to forward incorporate information, allows issuers to avoid delays and interruptions in the offering\nprocess and to access the capital markets in a more expeditious and efficient manner than raising capital in a standard registered offering pursuant to a Registration\nStatement on Form S-1. The ability to register securities for resale may also be limited as a result of the loss of Form S-3 eligibility.\nAs a result of our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2024 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we are currently ineligible to file registration statements on Form S-3. Our\ninability to use Form S-3 may impair our ability to raise necessary capital to fund our operations and execute our strategy. If we seek to access the capital markets through a\nregistered offering during the period of time that we are unable to use Form S-3, we may be required to publicly disclose the proposed offering and the material terms\nthereof before the offering commences, we may experience delays in the offering process due to SEC review of a Form S-1 registration statement and we may incur\nincreased offering and transaction costs and other considerations. Disclosing a public offering prior to the formal commencement of an offering may result in downward\npressure on the stock price of our Common Stock. If we are unable to raise capital through a registered offering, we would be required to conduct our equity financing\ntransactions on a private placement basis, which may be subject to pricing, size and other limitations imposed under the Nasdaq rules, or seek other sources of capital. The\nforegoing limitations on our financing approaches could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.\nWe expect to be dependent on sales of our BolaWrap product line for the foreseeable future, and if this product is not widely accepted, our growth prospects will be\ndiminished.\nWe expect to depend on sales of the BolaWrap product line and related cassettes for the foreseeable future. A lack of demand for this product, or its failure to achieve\nbroader market acceptance, would significantly harm our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition. To execute our business plan successfully, we will\nneed to execute on the following objectives, either on our own or with strategic collaborators:\n● Grow our commercialization of the BolaWrap product, and develop additional future products and accessories for commercialization;\n- 15 -\nTable of Contents\n● Maintain required regulatory approvals for our products in global market locations;\n● Expand, and as required, enforce our intellectual property portfolio for the BolaWrap product and other future products;\n● Maintain sales, distribution and marketing capabilities, and/or enter into strategic partnering arrangements to access such capabilities; and\n● Grow market acceptance for the BolaWrap product line and/or other future products.\nWe face risks commercializing our virtual reality training platform and may be unsuccessful in growing revenues.\nWe continue to invest substantial funds in further developing and commercializing our Wrap Reality product line which is highly competitive. The commercial launch of the\nWrap Reality Virtual Training product is in the early stages in a new marketplace for 3D Virtual Reality training that competes with a legacy 2D virtual training\nenvironment. We expect 2D virtual training companies to either try to buy out companies like ours or choose to have to build 3D Virtual reality to compete with us. As one\nof the only companies with both on premise 3D Virtual Reality and full cloud 3D Virtual Reality we plan to compete on both fronts; however, our ability to commercialize\nthis 3D Virtual Reality product line may be influenced by many factors, including:\n● our ability to continue to develop new products and new content;\n● our ability to obtain, set up and service new VR customers;\n● our ability to achieve and maintain market acceptance;\n● the impact of competition; and\n● our ability to attract and retain talent.\nWe face competition from companies with greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and, if we are unable to compete effectively with these\ncompetitors, our business could be harmed.\nWe face competition from other established companies. A number of our competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, significantly greater\nfinancial, technological, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing\nopportunities, technologies, standards or client requirements, more quickly develop new products or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and\nservices than we can. Likewise, their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the global public safety industry and\ncompete more effectively on the basis of price and production. In addition, new companies may enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in\nthe global public safety solutions industry.\nWe believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including the type and quality of our products and the strength of our brand\nnames, as well as many factors beyond our control. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and increased competition may result\nin price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand the development and\nmarketing of new products, any of which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are materially dependent on the acceptance of our product by the law enforcement market. If law enforcement agencies do not purchase our product or we do not\nmeet their expectations, our revenue will be adversely affected and we may not be able to expand into other markets, or otherwise continue as a going concern.\nA substantial number of law enforcement agencies may not purchase our remote restraint product. In addition, if our product is not widely accepted by the law enforcement\nmarket or we do not meet their expectations, we may not be able to expand sales of our product into other markets. Law enforcement agencies may be influenced by claims\nor perceptions that our product is not effective or may be used in an abusive manner. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not meet customer expectations for\nperformance, value and quality. Sales of our product to agencies may be delayed or limited by such claims or perceptions or to any negative publicity or damage to our\nreputation. We now receive earned media that is often positive and helps our sales and growth and having negative earned media will create the opposite effect.\n- 16 -\nTable of Contents\nWe may incur significant and unpredictable warranty costs as our products are produced, sold, and used.\nWe warrant our products to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of up to one year from the date of purchase. Additional one-year warranties can\nbe purchased by the customer. We may incur substantial and unpredictable warranty costs from post-production product or component failures. Future warranty costs could\nfurther adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and business prospects.\nWe could incur charges for excess or obsolete inventory and incur production costs for improvements or model changes.\nWhile we strive to effectively manage our inventory, rapidly changing technology, and uneven customer demand may result in short product cycles and the value of our\ninventory may be adversely affected by changes in technology that affect our ability to sell the products in our inventory. If we do not effectively forecast and manage our\ninventory, we may need to write off inventory as excess or obsolete, which in turn can adversely affect cost of sales and gross profit.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, improvement and model changes and unusual production costs associated with implementing production for our\nproducts. We currently have no reserve for slow moving or obsolete inventory but may incur future charges for obsolete or excess inventory.\nOur international operations could be harmed by factors including natural disasters, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and changes in regulations that govern\ninternational transactions.\nWe sell our products worldwide and have exported to multiple countries. We expect exports to continue to be a significant part of our future business. The risks inherent in\ninternational trade may reduce our international sales or impede growth and harm our business and the businesses of our customers and our suppliers. These risks include,\namong other things:\n● Changes in tariff regulations;\n● Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n● Establishing and maintaining relationships with local distributors, agents and dealers;\n● Lengthy shipping times and accounts receivable payment cycles;\n● Import and export control and licensing requirements;\n● Compliance with a variety of US laws, ATF regulations, US Department of Commerce regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, by us or key\nsubcontractors or agents;\n● Compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including unexpected changes in taxation and regulatory requirements;\n● Greater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property abroad than in the US; and\n● Difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations.\nThese and other risks may preclude or curtail international sales or increase the relative price of our products compared to those manufactured in other countries, reducing\nthe demand for our products. Failure to comply with US and international governmental laws and regulations applicable to international business, such as the Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act or US export control regulations, could have an adverse impact on our business with the US and international governments.\n- 17 -\nTable of Contents\nGlobal economic weakness and uncertainty, geopolitical conflict, war, and civil unrest, could adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and expenses.\nOur business may be impacted by global economic conditions, which have been volatile in recent years. Geopolitical conflict, such as the current conflict in Ukraine, and\nrelated international economic sanctions and their impact may exacerbate this volatility. Specifically, our revenues and gross margins depend significantly on global\neconomic conditions and the demand by foreign governments and agencies for the BolaWrap and Wrap Reality in many of our target markets. Economic weakness and\nuncertainty in these markets have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenue attributable to these markets, gross margin, earnings or growth rates, and\ndifficulty managing inventory levels. Sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions and geopolitical events may adversely affect demand for the BolaWrap and\ncould cause demand to differ materially from our expectations as foreign governments and agencies curtail or delay spending. Economic weakness and uncertainty also\nmake it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenues, gross margins and expenses.\nPublic health crises could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by the effects of future pandemics, epidemics or infectious disease outbreaks. The extent to which the COVID-19 or other\npandemics will in the future impact our financial conditions and results of operations, or those of our third-party suppliers, will depend on future developments, which are\nhighly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, including the continued duration of the outbreak in the markets we target.\nSubstantially all our employees are located in the US. In addition to our employees, we rely on (i) distributors, agents, and third-party logistics providers in connection with\nproduct sales and distribution and (ii) raw material and component suppliers in the US, Canada, Europe and Asia. If we, or any of these third-party partners encounter any\ndisruptions to our or their respective operations or facilities, or if we or any of these third-party partners were to shut down for any reason, including by pandemic, fire,\nnatural disaster, such as a hurricane, tornado or severe storm, power outage, systems failure, labor dispute, or other unforeseen disruption, then we or they may be prevented\nor delayed from effectively operating our or their business, respectively. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and\nour ability to conduct business as expected.\nWe anticipate that a significant portion of our revenue in the short-term will be generated from international sales, which may adversely affect our ability to timely\ncollect accounts receivable.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated approximately38% of our revenue from international sales. Due principally to the longer sales cycle, procurement\ndelays and regulatory issues associated with domestic sales versus international sales, we currently anticipate that a significant portion of our sales in the year ending\nDecember 31, 2023 will be generated from international orders. In the event we are unable to timely collect account receivables associated with international sales, or\ntiming of such international sales is delayed, our financial condition could be adversely and materially affected.\nIf we are unable to manage our projected growth, our growth prospects may be limited, and our future profitability may be adversely affected.\nWe intend to continue to expand our sales and marketing and our manufacturing capability. Rapid expansion may strain our staffing, financial and other resources. If we are\nunable to manage our growth, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our systems, procedures, controls, and management\nresources may not be adequate to support our future growing operations, and we have started to upgrade them and will continue to do so in 2024. We are working to\ncontinually improve our operational, financial, and other internal systems to manage our growth effectively, and any failure to do so may lead to inefficiencies and\nredundancies, and result in reduced growth prospects and profitability.\nWe may face personal injury and other liability claims that harm our reputation and adversely affect our sales and financial condition.\nOur product is intended to be used in confrontations to de-escalate the situation and reduce the chance for injury to officers and the subjects that they interact with. There is\nalways a chance that use could result in injury to those involved. Our product may cause or be associated with such injuries. A person injured in a confrontation or otherwise\nin connection with the use of our product may bring legal action against us to recover damages based on theories including personal injury, wrongful death, negligent\ndesign, dangerous product, or inadequate warning. We may also be subject to lawsuits involving allegations of misuse of our product. If successful, personal injury, misuse,\nand other claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Although we carry product liability insurance, significant litigation\ncould also result in a diversion of management’s attention and resources, negative publicity, and an award of monetary damages in excess of our insurance coverage.\n- 18 -\nTable of Contents\nThe nature of our business may result in undesirable press coverage or other negative publicity.\nOur solutions are used to assist law enforcement and first responders in volatile encounters. Even when our device works as intended, incidents can lead to injury, loss of\nlife and other negative outcomes, and such events are likely to receive negative publicity even if not directly caused by BolaWrap. If our product fails to help de-escalate an\nencounter, related adverse outcomes may receive negative media attention. At times, body or dash camera images or other images of use of our product may become a\nmatter of public record due to legal or other obligations (for example, because of public-records requests or subpoenas to provide information or to testify in court), and we\nmay receive negative media attention as a result.\nWe may be subject to criticism and unflattering media coverage regarding the effectiveness of our remote restraint solutions and the cost of our solutions to our customers,\nor the appropriateness of use on persons in crisis or the mentally ill. Such negative publicity could have an adverse impact on new sales, which would adversely impact our\nfinancial results and prospects.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to expand sales, and our inability to grow our sales force or maintain and grow distributors would negatively affect our\nsales.\nOur distribution strategy is to pursue sales through multiple channels with an emphasis on direct sales, as well as independent distributors, domestically and internationally.\nOur inability to recruit and retain sales personnel and maintain and add police equipment distributors who can successfully sell our products could adversely affect our sales.\nIf we do not competitively price our products, provide high quality big free products and solutions, meet the requirements of any end-users, provide adequate marketing\nsupport, or comply with the terms of any distribution arrangements, such distributors may fail to aggressively market our product or may terminate their relationships with\nus. These developments would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales. Our reliance on the sales of our products by distributors for a large portion of our sales also\nmakes it more difficult to predict our revenue, cash flow and operating results.\nWe expect to expend significant resources to generate sales due to our lengthy sales cycle, and such efforts may not result in the level of sales or revenue we expect.\nGenerally, law enforcement agencies consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase a product, including product benefits, training time and costs, the cost to\nuse our product in addition to, or in place of, other less lethal products, time in market, product reliability and budget constraints. The length of our sales cycle may range\nfrom 30 days to a year or more. We may incur substantial selling costs and expend significant effort in connection with the evaluation of our product by potential customers\nbefore they place an order if they place an order at all. If these potential customers do not purchase our product, we will have expended significant resources without\ncorresponding revenue.\nMost of our intended end-users are subject to budgetary and political constraints that may delay or prevent sales.\nMost of our intended end-user customers are government agencies at all levels. These agencies often do not set their own budgets and therefore have little control over the\namount of money they can spend. In addition, these agencies experience political pressure that may dictate the way they spend money. As a result, even if an agency wants\nto acquire our product, it may be unable to purchase our product due to budgetary or political constraints. Some government agency orders may also be canceled or\nsubstantially delayed due to budgetary, political, or other scheduling delays, which frequently occur in connection with the acquisition of products by such agencies.\nOur dependence on third-party suppliers for key components of our products makes us vulnerable to price increases, inflation, recession, and supply shortages that\ncould delay shipment of our products and reduce our sales or margins.\nWe depend on certain domestic and foreign suppliers for the delivery of components used in the assembly of our product. Approximately 70% of our supply chain is from\ndomestic US suppliers. Our reliance on third-party suppliers creates risks related to our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components or sub-assemblies and\nreduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of components and subassemblies. Specifically, we depend on suppliers of sub-assemblies, electronic components,\ninjection molded plastic parts, and other miscellaneous custom parts for our product, some from sole source suppliers. In late 2022 we started to drive more diversity into\nour supply chain, and we plan to continue to build multiple suppliers for critical parts to reduce our dependence on a small number of suppliers. We are still subject to the\nrisk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that our suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products. In addition,\nthe lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities or changes for bugs or enhancements. Delays in our suppliers’\nabilities, especially any sole suppliers, to provide us with necessary materials and components may delay production or may require us to seek alternative supply sources.\nAny delay in receiving supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\n- 19 -\nTable of Contents\nWe have recently experienced, and in the future are likely to experience, disruption of the supply of some of our parts, components, and assemblies that we obtain from\nsuppliers. For example, the rapid increase in global demand as the COVID-19 pandemic waned caused, and may continue to cause, significant stress on global supply\nchains. As economies around the world have reopened, sharp increases in demand created significant disruptions to the global supply chain, which affected our ability to\nsource and receive certain goods on a timely basis and at anticipated costs. Increases in input costs and freight due to price inflation and global supply chain disruptions may\nadversely affect our financial performance.\nWe do not have any long-term supply agreements with any suppliers. We actively monitor and attempt to mitigate supply chain risk, but there can be no assurance that our\nmitigation plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages of materials that we use in the production of our products. Any interruption of supply\nfor any material components of our products could significantly delay production and shipment of our products and have a material adverse effect on our revenue,\nprofitability, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquisitions in the future, and we may not be able to realize revenue enhancements or other synergies from such\nacquisitions.\nIn November 2022, we acquired the rights to certain software assets and services to drive the rapid enhancement of our Wrap Reality Cloud platform, and in August 2023\nwe acquired Intrensic, LLC, which included a Body-Worn Camera and Digital Evidence Management solution. However, our ability to successfully implement our business\nplan and achieve targeted financial results and other benefits including, among other things, greater market presence and development, and enhancements to our product\nportfolio and customer base, is dependent on our ability to successfully identify, consummate and integrate acquisitions we may acquire in the future. We may not realize\nthe intended benefits of the acquisition of other businesses in the future as rapidly as, or to the extent, anticipated by our management. There can be no assurance that we\nwill be able to successfully integrate any other acquired businesses, products or technologies without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems.\nAcquisitions involve several risks, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our acquired businesses, products or technologies. Furthermore, there can be\nno assurance that any acquired business, product, or technology will be profitable or achieve anticipated revenues and income. Our failure to manage our acquisition and\nintegration strategy successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The process of integrating an acquired\nbusiness involves risks, including but not limited to:\n● Demands on management related to changes in the size and possible locations of our businesses and employees;\n● Diversion of management's attention from the management of daily operations;\n● Difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures, employees and business practices;\n● Retaining the loyalty and business of the employees or customers of acquired businesses;\n● Retaining employees that may be vital to the integration of acquired businesses or to the future prospects of the combined businesses;\n● Difficulties and unanticipated expense related to the integration of departments, information technology systems, including accounting systems,\ntechnologies, books and records, and procedures, and maintaining uniform standards, such as internal accounting controls, procedures, and policies;\n● Costs and expense associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities; and\n● The use of more cash or other financial resources on integration and implementation activities than we expect.\nFailure to successfully integrate any acquired business in the future may result in reduced levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency than might have been achieved\nif we had not acquired such businesses.\n- 20 -\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the acquisition of any future businesses could result in additional debt and related interest expense, contingent liabilities, and amortization expense related to\nintangible assets, as well as the issuance of our Common Stock, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flow.\nGovernment regulation of our products may adversely affect sales.\nOur BolaWrap device is classified as a firearm and the BolaWrap 150 is also classified as an “Any other Weapon” (“AOW”). Both firearms and explosive devices are\nregulated by the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”) involving substantial regulatory compliance. ATF regulations are enforced by\nsurveillance and inspection of federal firearms licensees (“FFLs”). If ATF finds a violation, it can institute a wide range of enforcement actions, ranging from warnings to\nmore severe sanctions such as fines, penalties, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions or total\nshutdown of production, and criminal prosecution. Any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nThe federal firearms laws impose strict controls over the possession and transfers of firearms, which may impact our ability to transfer devices to customers. Because ATF\nhas classified our devices as AOWs, we must register our devices with the ATF at the time of manufacture. Before we may transfer our registered devices to any customer,\nincluding a government agency, we must obtain approval from the ATF. The ATF processing time for transfer applications varies significantly, depending on the prospective\ntransferee. Applications to transfer AOWs to U.S., state or local government entities are usually processed in 1-3 weeks, while transfers to private, non-licensed individuals\nrequire a longer processing time because of the required background investigation of the transferee. These types of transfers may take 6-8 months or longer.\nThe federal firearms laws prohibit interstate transfers of firearms to non-licensed persons or entities. Consequently, we are prohibited from transferring our devices directly\nto a non-government, non-licensed individual or entity in a different state. To accomplish such a transfer, we must first obtain ATF approval to transfer the device to another\nFFL dealer in the end-user’s state. After that transfer is completed, the FFL dealer must obtain ATF approval to transfer the device to the non-government, non-licensed\nindividual. The ATF may deny any transfer application if such transfer would violate state law or when the transferee is prohibited from possessing a firearm.\nOur device may face state restrictions, especially regarding sales to private security agencies. Our product sales may be significantly affected by international, federal, state\nand local regulations. Failure to comply with regulations could also result in the imposition of fines, penalties and other actions that could adversely impact our financial\nposition, cash flows and operating results.\nOur product is also controlled by the US Department of Commerce (“DOC”) for exports directly from the US. Consequently, we need to obtain export licenses from the\nDOC for the export of our products from the US. Compliance with or future changes in US export regulations could significantly and adversely affect any future\ninternational sales.\nThe shipment of some of our components and our products involve conformity to regulations governing the transport of “dangerous goods”. Failure to comply with\nshipping regulations could result in the imposition of fines, penalties and other actions that could adversely impact our financial position, cash flows and operating results.\nCertain foreign jurisdictions may restrict the importation or sale of our products, limiting our international sales opportunities.\nOur products, including the BolaWrap 100 and BolaWrap 150, are protected by limited patent and other intellectual property protection. If we are unable to protect our\nintellectual property, we may lose a competitive advantage or incur substantial litigation costs to protect our rights.\nOur future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. We currently own twenty-two issued US patents related to the BolaWrap technology and have eight US\npatents pending. We have filed foreign patent applications in the European Union (up to 39 countries) and seventeen other countries and reserved our rights to file additional\nforeign patents. Our protective measures taken thus far, including our issued patents, pending patents, issued and pending trademarks and trade secret laws, may prove\ninadequate to protect our proprietary rights. To date we have a total of 67 issued domestic and international patents for our small global company. During 2023 we filed nine\npatent applications, seven of which were US filings. We feel the significant investment in patent protection in the US and abroad creates a significant amount of IP and\nvalue in Wrap Technologies. However, there can be no assurance we will be granted any patent rights from pending patents. The scope of any possible patent rights may not\nprevent others from developing and selling competing products. The validity and breadth of claims covered in any possible patents involve complex legal and factual\nquestions, and the resolution of such claims may be highly uncertain, lengthy, and expensive. In addition, any patents, if granted, may be held invalid upon challenge, or\nothers may claim rights in or ownership of our patents.\n- 21 -\nTable of Contents\nOur competitive position may be seriously damaged if our products are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nOther companies and our competitors may currently own or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that might prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or\nsell our products. Any intellectual property infringement claims made against us, with or without merit, could be costly and time-consuming to defend and divert our\nmanagement’s attention from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and if we are unable to license the allegedly infringed technology,\nour business and operating results could be adversely affected. Any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.\nAn adverse result from intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following:\n● Cease selling, incorporating, or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n● Obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and\n● Redesign products or services that incorporate the disputed technology.\nIf we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions, we could face substantial costs and shipment delays and our business could be materially harmed. Although we carry\ngeneral liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed.\nIn addition, it is possible that others may seek indemnity from us if our products are found or alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claim for\nindemnity could result in substantial expense to us that could harm our operating results.\nCompetition in the law enforcement market could reduce our sales, make our products obsolete or inferior and prevent us from achieving profitability.\nThe law enforcement market is highly competitive, and adoption of new policing tools and innovative training solutions may take time, Law enforcement adherence to\ncurrently used products may also slow adaptation to new policing tools. We face competition from numerous larger, better capitalized, more experienced and more widely\nknown companies that make less-lethal weapons and other law enforcement products. One or more of our competitors may have developed or may succeed in developing\ntechnologies and products that are more effective than any of ours, rendering our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Increased competition could result in\nreduced sales, greater pricing pressure, lower gross margins, and prevent us from achieving profitability.\nForeign currency fluctuations may reduce our competitiveness and sales in international markets.\nThe relative change in currency values creates fluctuations in product pricing for future potential international customers. These changes in international end-user costs may\nresult in lost orders and reduce the competitiveness of our products in certain international markets. These changes may also negatively affect the financial condition of\nsome international customers and reduce or eliminate their future orders of our products.\nOur business is dependent on the ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe are dependent on our ability to retain and motivate our high-quality personnel, especially managers, sales and skilled engineering and manufacturing personnel.\nCompetition for such personnel is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified managerial, sales and technical personnel in the\nfuture. The inability to attract and retain the necessary managerial, sales and technical personnel could cause our business, operating results or financial condition to suffer.\nIn 2022, the business went through significant transformation including the creation of our mission, vision and core values. New management built the company's first\nstrategic roadmap to outline the market space where BolaWrap and Wrap Reality fit and have changed significant elements of the business to improve training, which has\nnow become a revenue source over a cost center. There has been a shift to build repeatable domestic sales and build additional resources into international sales. We\nchanged our customer service department into a customer success team. We improved our pricing on devices and cassettes. We built additional distributor relationships. The\nnew management team significantly reduced operating expenses in almost all areas. These changes reduced overall headcount, contractor costs and spending. While greatly\nimproving our financial foundation, it also required turnover of personnel and changes to how we operate.\n- 22 -\nTable of Contents\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Financial Statements and Operating Results\nWe cannot predict our future operating results. Our quarterly and annual results will likely be subject to fluctuations caused by many factors, any of which could result\nin our failure to achieve our expectations.\nWe currently expect that the BolaWrap product will be the primary source of our revenue in 2024. We expect our revenue to vary significantly due to several factors. Many\nof these factors are beyond our control. Any one or more of these factors, including those listed below, could cause us to fail to achieve our revenue expectations. These\nfactors include, among others:\n● Our ability to develop, manufacture, ship and supply product to customers;\n● Market acceptance of, and changes in demand for, our products;\n● Gains or losses of significant customers, distributors, or strategic relationships;\n● Unpredictable volume and timing of customer orders;\n● The availability, pricing, and timeliness of delivery of components in our supply chain for our products;\n● Fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields and related manufacturing costs;\n● Timing of new technological advances, product announcements or introductions by us and by our competitors;\n● Unpredictable warranty costs associated with our products;\n● Budgetary cycles and order delays by customers or production delays by us or our suppliers;\n● Regulatory changes affecting the marketability of our products;\n● Logistics challenges of obtaining supplies and components and shipping products resulting from the pandemic;\n● General economic conditions that could affect the timing of customer orders and capital spending and result in order cancellations or rescheduling;\n● General political conditions in this country and in various other parts of the world that could affect spending for the products that we intend to offer; and\n● Seasonality of purchasing timeframes and procurement delays impact sales.\nSome or all of these factors could adversely affect demand for our products and, therefore, adversely affect our future operating results. As a result of these and other\nfactors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful in the near term, and accordingly you should not rely upon our\nperformance in a particular period as indicative of our performance in any future period.\nOur expenses may vary from period to period, which could affect quarterly results and our stock price.\nIf we incur additional expenses in a quarter in which we do not experience increased revenue, our results of operations will be adversely affected, and we may incur larger\nlosses than anticipated for that quarter. Factors that could cause our expense to fluctuate from period to period include:\n● The timing and extent of our research and development efforts;\n- 23 -\nTable of Contents\n● Investments and costs of maintaining or protecting our intellectual property;\n● Marketing and sales efforts to promote our products and technologies;\n● The timing of personnel and consultant hiring; and\n● Supply chain and inventory cost variations.\nMost of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term. We may be unable to rapidly adjust spending to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfalls, which\ncould harm our quarterly operating results and our stock price. We do not have the ability to predict future operating results with any certainty.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Series A Preferred Stock\nThe Certificate of Designations for the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock provides for dividends to be issued in the form of shares of Common Stock at a conversion\nprice that varies with the trading price of our Common Stock, and it contains “full ratchet” anti-dilution provisions applicable to the dividend conversion price and the\nconversion price for voluntary conversions of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into Common Stock. These features may result in a greater number of shares of\nCommon Stock being issued upon conversions than if the conversions were effected at the conversion price in effect at the time of this offering. Sales of these shares\nwill dilute the interests of other security holders and may depress the price of our Common Stock and make it difficult for us to raise additional capital.\nThe Certificate of Designations (the “Certificate of Designations”) for our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) provides for the payment of\ndividends to the holder of our Series A Preferred Stock in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, at the Company’s option. If the Company elects to pay\nany dividends in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price (as defined herein) used to calculate the number of shares issuable will equal to the lower of (i) the then\napplicable Conversion Price and (ii) 85% of the arithmetic average of the three (3) lowest closing prices of the Common Stock during the twenty (20) consecutive trading\nday period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the dividend payment date, subject to a floor price. The Certificate of Designations also contains “full ratchet”\nanti-dilution provisions applicable to the conversion prices used in voluntary conversions of Series A Preferred Stock by the holders thereof and by the Company in paying\nany dividends in shares of Common Stock, which provisions require the lowering of the applicable conversion price, as then in effect, to the purchase price of equity or\nequity-linked securities issued in subsequent offerings. If in the future, while any of our Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, we issue securities at an effective Common\nStock purchase price that is less than the applicable conversion price of our Series A Preferred Stock, as then in effect, we will be required, subject to certain limitations and\nadjustments as provided in the Certificate of Designations for the Preferred Stock, to further reduce the relevant conversion price, which will result in a greater number of\nshares of Common Stock being issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock or upon the payment of dividends to the holders of the Preferred Stock in shares of\nCommon Stock, which in turn will have a greater dilutive effect on our shareholders. The potential for such additional issuances may depress the price of our Common\nStock regardless of our business performance. We may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital while any of our Preferred Stock is outstanding.\nFurther, it is possible that we will not have a sufficient number of available shares to satisfy the conversion of the Preferred Stock or the payment of dividends to the holders\nof the Preferred Stock in shares of Common Stock if we enter into a future transaction that reduces the applicable conversion price. If we do not have a sufficient number of\navailable shares for any Preferred Stock conversions, we will be required to increase our authorized shares, which may not be possible and will be time consuming and\nexpensive.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock provides for the payment of dividends in cash or in shares of our Common Stock, or a combination thereof, and we may not be permitted\nto pay such dividends in cash, which will require us to have shares of Common Stock available to pay the dividends.\nEach share of the Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate per share of 8% per annum of the stated value per share. The dividends are\npayable in cash, out of any funds legally available for such purpose, or shares of Common Stock, or a combination thereof, at the Company’s option. The conversion price\nused to calculate the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in connection with a given dividend payment is subject to reduction if in the future we issue securities for\nless than the conversion price of our Series A Preferred Stock, as then in effect. This may have the effect of increasing the number of shares we would be obligated to issue\nin order to make a dividend payment in shares of Series A Common Stock. We will not be permitted to pay the dividend in cash unless we are legally permitted to do so\nunder Delaware law. As such, we may rely on having available shares of Common Stock to pay such dividends, which will result in dilution to our stockholders. If we do\nnot have such available shares, we may not be able to satisfy our dividend obligations.\n- 24 -\nTable of Contents\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile and may continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in substantial losses for investors.\nThe market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated significantly to date and in the future may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are\nbeyond our control, including the factors listed below and other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section:\n● Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n● Failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our Company, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our Company,\nor our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n● Rating changes by any securities analysts who follow our Company;\n● Changes in the availability of federal funding to support local law enforcement efforts, or local budgets;\n● International budget changes or changeover in government leadership;\n● Announcements by us of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n● Changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other security product companies generally;\n● Price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n● Announcements of merger or acquisition transactions;\n● Changes in our board of directors or management and key personnel;\n● Sales of large blocks of our Common Stock, including sales by our founders, executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n● Lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n● Short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock;\n● General economic conditions in the US and abroad; and\n● Other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many\nsecurity and technology companies. Stock prices of many security and technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating\nperformance of those companies. Stock prices of nanocap securities and small cap securities have fluctuated even more than medium and large cap companies in recent\nyears.\n- 25 -\nTable of Contents\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to securities litigation, which has and may be expensive and has and could divert management attention.\nOur share price is volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation.\nFor instance, in September 2020 a putative class action lawsuit and in November 2020 a shareholder derivative lawsuit were filed against us and certain of our directors and\nofficers. The lawsuit was dismissed in May 2022.\nLawsuits of this nature divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. Although we denied the material allegations in the\nlawsuits and defended ourselves vigorously, defending the lawsuits may result in substantial costs. Any lawsuit to which we or our directors or officers are a party, with or\nwithout merit, may result in an unfavorable judgment. We also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of\nsubstantial damages or fines, damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our offerings or business practices. Any of these results could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, we may be the target of securities-related litigation in the future. Such litigation may divert our management’s attention and resources, result in substantial costs,\nand have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We maintain director and officer insurance that we regard as reasonably adequate\nto protect us from potential claims; however, we cannot assure you that it will. Further, if we are subject to future litigation, the costs of insurance may increase, and the\navailability of coverage may decrease. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our current levels of insurance at a reasonable cost, or at all, which might make it more\ndifficult to attract qualified candidates to serve as executive officers or directors of the Company.\nOur officers and directors are among our largest stockholders and may have certain personal interests that may affect the Company.\nManagement and certain directors owned more than 10% of our Common Stock at December 31, 2023. As a result, our management and certain directors, acting\nindividually or as a group, has the potential ability to exert influence on the outcome of issues requiring approval by our stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nSales or distributions of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the\nmarket price of our Common Stock. Many of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, other than the shares held by executive officers and directors, are eligible for\nimmediate resale in the public market. Substantial selling of our Common Stock could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock could be delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nNasdaq’s continued listing standards for our Common Stock require, among other things, that we maintain a closing bid price for our Common Stock of at least $1.00, we\nmaintain (A) stockholders’ equity of $2.5 million; (B) market value of listed securities of $35 million; or (C) net income from continuing operations of $500,000 in the most\nrecently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years, and timely file all required reports with the SEC.\nOn April 18, 2024, the Company received a notice (the “Initial Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the\nCompany that as it has not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10‑K”) for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company is not in compliance with\nListing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Listing Rule”) for continued listing on Nasdaq. Additionally, on May 17, 2024, the Company received a notice (the “May Notice\") from\nNasdaq notifying the Company that as it has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Q1 Form 10‑Q”) for the three months ended March 31, 2024, that the\nCompany is not in compliance with the Listing Rule.\nOn August 16, 2024, the Company received a notice (the “August Notice,\" and collectively with the Initial Notice and the May Notice, the “Notices”) from Nasdaq\nnotifying the Company that as it has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Q2 Form 10‑Q,” and collectively with the Form 10-K and Q1 Form 10-Q, the\n“Delinquent Filings”) for the six months ended June 30, 2024, that the Company is not in compliance with the Listing Rule for continued listing on Nasdaq\nThe Company previously submitted a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance with respect to the delinquent Form 10-K and Q1 Form 10-Q (the “Plan”), and Nasdaq granted\nan exception until August 30, 2024, to file the delinquent Form 10-K and Q1 Form 10-Q. Pursuant to the August Notice, the Company is required to submit an update to the\nPlan to Nasdaq no later than September 3, 2024, to regain compliance with respect to the filing requirements. Nasdaq may grant the Company an additional exception of up\nto a maximum of 180 calendar days from the filing due date of the Form 10-K to file all Delinquent Filings, or until October 14, 2024, to regain compliance.\n- 26 -\nTable of Contents\nA delisting of our common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and result in a corresponding material\nreduction in the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at\nall, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities.\nWe may issue additional shares of Common Stock in the future. The issuance of additional shares of Common Stock may reduce the value of your Common Stock.\nWe may issue additional shares of Common Stock without further action by our stockholders. Moreover, the economic and voting interests of each stockholder will be\ndiluted as a result of any such issuances. Although the number of shares of Common Stock that stockholders presently own will not decrease, such shares will represent a\nsmaller percentage of the total shares that will be outstanding after the issuance of additional shares. The issuance of additional shares of Common Stock may cause the\nmarket price of our Common Stock to decline.\nSales of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of any future options or warrants and vesting of restricted stock units may lower the price of our Common\nStock.\nAt December 31, 2023, we had we had outstanding options and unvested stock units of 5.2 million shares of our Common Stock. The issuance of shares of Common Stock\nissuable upon the exercise of options or issuance from restricted stock units or the exercise of warrants that may be outstanding in the future could cause substantial dilution\nto existing holders of our Common Stock, and the sale of those shares in the market could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. The potential dilution\nfrom the issuance of these shares could negatively affect the terms on which we are able to obtain equity financing.\nWe may issue preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of your Common Stock.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 5.0 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our Board of Directors may determine the terms of future preferred stock\nofferings without further action by our stockholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect your rights or reduce the value of your Common Stock. In particular, specific\nrights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. Preferred stock terms may include\nvoting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions.\nWe incur substantial costs as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant levels of legal, accounting, insurance, exchange listing fees and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are\nsubject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing\nrequirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and\nfinancial compliance costs, makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increases demand on our systems and resources as compared to when we\noperated as a private company. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating\nresults. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In\norder to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources\nand management oversight may be required. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business\nand operating results. We may need to hire more corporate employees in the future or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which would increase\nour costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal\nand financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases\ndue to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This\ncould result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to\ninvest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of\nmanagement’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from\nthe activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings\nagainst us and our business may be adversely affected.\n- 27 -\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of disclosure of information in this report and in the filings that we are required to make as a public company, our business, operating results, and financial\ncondition have become more visible, which has resulted in, and may in the future result in threatened or actual litigation, increased competition due to this insight, including\nby key competitors and other third parties. If any such claims are successful, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected, and even if\nthe claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our\nmanagement and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nWe have never declared dividends on our Common Stock, and currently do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future. The declaration and amount of future\ndividends, if any, will be determined by our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, financial covenants, regulatory\nconstraints, industry practice and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities\nExchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules\nand forms. Our management expects that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, they cannot\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the\nrealities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented\nby the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is\nbased in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all\npotential future conditions. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be\ndetected.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could harm stockholder and business confidence in our financial reporting, our\nability to obtain financing and other aspects of our business.\nMaintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 (\"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\") and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC require us to include in our Form 10-K a report by management regarding the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report includes, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of the end of the respective fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This\nassessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. While our management has\nconcluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023, it is possible that material weaknesses will be identified in the future. In\naddition, components of our internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time. If management is unable to assert that our internal control\nover financial reporting is effective in any future period, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an\nadverse effect on the Company’s stock price.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\n- 28 -\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nWe maintain a comprehensive process for identifying, assessing, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats (as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of\nRegulation S-K) as part of our broader risk management system and processes. The cybersecurity risk management system involves risk assessments, implementation of\nsecurity measures, and ongoing monitoring of systems and networks, including networks on which we rely. We actively monitor the current threat landscape in an effort to\nidentify material risks arising from new and evolving cybersecurity threats. We obtain input, as appropriate, for our cybersecurity risk management program on the security\nindustry and threat trends from consultants, cybersecurity assessors, auditors and other third parties to gather certain insights designed to identify and assess material\ncybersecurity threat risks, their severity and potential mitigations. We depend on and engage various third parties, including suppliers, vendors, and service providers. Our\nrisk management, legal, information technology, and compliance personnel identify and oversee risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of such entities.\nAny incident assessed as potentially being or potentially becoming material is immediately escalated for further assessment, and then reported to Mr. Srinivasan, our\ndesignated member of our Board of Directors.\nMr. Srinivasan has oversight responsibility for risks and incidents relating to cybersecurity threats, including compliance with disclosure requirements, cooperation with law\nenforcement, and related effects on financial and other risks, and report any findings and recommendations, as appropriate, to the full Board of Directors for consideration.\nSenior management regularly discusses cyber risks and trends and, should they arise, any material incidents with the designated member of the Board of Directors.\nOur business strategy, results of operations and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from cybersecurity threats, but we cannot provide assurance\nthat they will not be materially affected in the future by such risks or any future material incidents. Further, a cyber incident impacting our systems or a third-party’s systems\ncould subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputational risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For\nmore information on our cybersecurity related risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nIn November 2023, we commenced a lease in an office building located at 3480 Main Highway, Coconut Grove, Florida. The lease of 4,487 square feet for an initial term of\n94 months, including 5 months of rent abatement in the first two years of the lease. The aggregate monthly payments will restart in 2024 for $39,635 per month, increasing\n3% each year through the lease term, plus other certain costs and charges as specified in the lease agreement.\nOur executive offices, sales, training, assembly, and warehouse facilities are located at 1817 West 4th Street, Tempe, Arizona. The lease of 11,256 square feet commenced in\nJune 2019 and was for an initial lease term through July 2022. In January 2022 we renewed this lease for three years with aggregate monthly payments of $9,905\ncommencing August 2022, increasing 4% annually through the term ending July 31, 2025.\nBeginning in October 2017, we commenced reimbursing former officer, stockholder and consultant, Mr. Elwood Norris, $1,500 per month on a month-to-month basis for\nlaboratory facility costs. The Company leased the laboratory facilities for all twelve months in 2023.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe may become subject to other legal proceedings, as well as demands and claims that arise in the normal course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement\nof third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, breach of contract, employment law violations, and other matters and matters involving requests for information\nfrom us or our customers under federal or state law. Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and management resources.\nWe make a provision for liability relating to legal matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nThese provisions are reviewed and adjusted to include the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and\nevents pertaining to a particular matter. On December 31, 2023, we had no provision for liability under existing litigation.\nAn unfavorable outcome on any litigation matters could require payment of substantial damages, or, in connection with any intellectual property infringement claims, could\nrequire us to pay ongoing royalty payments or could prevent us from selling certain of our products. As a result, a settlement of, or an unfavorable outcome on, any of the\nmatters referenced above or other litigation matters, or legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash\nflows.\nITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe discussion and analysis set forth below should be read in conjunction with the information presented in other sections of this Annual Report, including “Item 1.\nBusiness,” “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that\nreflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates” and similar expressions or variations of\nsuch words are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the only means of identifying forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ\nmaterially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a global public safety technology and services company that delivers safe and effective policing solutions to law enforcement and security personnel worldwide. We\nare leading the movement for safer outcomes by equipping law enforcement with safer, non-painful compliance tools and immersive training fir for modern society. We\nbegan sales of our first public safety product, the BolaWrap 100 remote restraint device, in late 2018. In late 2020 we added a new solution to our public safety\ntechnologies, which is our virtual reality (“VR”) training platform, Wrap Reality. Wrap Reality is now sold to law enforcement agencies for simulation training as well as\ncorrections departments for the societal reentry scenarios. In the first quarter of 2022 we delivered a new generation product, the BolaWrap 150.

Additionally, we are exploring opportunities in other domestic markets, such as military\nand private security. Our international focus is on countries with the largest police forces. According to 360iResearch, a market research consulting firm, our non-lethal\nproducts are part of a global market segment expected to grow to $16.1 billion by 2027.\nWe focus our efforts on the following products and services:\nBolaWrap Remote Restraint Device – a hand-held remote restraint device that discharges a seven and half-foot Kevlar tether to entangle an individual at a range of 10-25\nfeet. BolaWrap assists law enforcement to safely and effectively control encounters early without resorting to painful force options.\nWrap Reality – a law enforcement 3D training system employing immersive computer graphics VR with proprietary software-enabled content. It allows up to two\nparticipants to enter a simulated training environment simultaneously, and customized weapons controllers enable trainees to engage in strategic decision making along the\nforce continuum. Wrap Reality has 43 scenarios for law enforcement and corrections and 15 scenarios for societal reentry. Wrap Reality is one of the most robust 3D Virtual\nReality solutions on the market for law enforcement and societal reentry today.\nWrap Intrensic – a Body-Worn Camera (“BWC”) and Digital Evidence Management (“DEM”) solutions provider. BWC and DEM play crucial role in capturing, storing,\nand managing digital evidence, such as video and audio recordings for various purposes, including criminal investigations and maintaining transparency in public\ninteractions.

Wrap Intrensic Evidence on Cloud provides an unlimited video storage platform that includes video and other evidence uploading, search,\nretrieval, redaction, and evidence sharing while reducing the need for resources required to manage this evidence.\nIn addition to the US law enforcement market, we have shipped our restraint products to 62 countries. We have established an active distributor network representing 50\nstates and one dealer representing the US territory of Puerto Rico. We have distribution agreements with international distributors covering 75 countries. We focus\nsignificant sales, training and business development efforts to support our distribution network in addition to our internal sales team.\nWe focus significant resources on research and development innovations and continue to enhance our products and plan to introduce new products. We believe we have\nestablished a strong brand and market presence globally and have established significant competitive advantages in our markets.\n- 31 -\nTable of Contents\nRecent Developments\nNasdaq Deficiency Notice\nOn April 18, 2024, the Company received a notice (the “Initial Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the\nCompany that as it has not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “2023 Form 10 K”) for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company is not in compliance\nwith Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the “Listing Rule”) for continued listing on Nasdaq. Additionally, on May 17, 2024, the Company received a notice (the “May Notice\") from\nNasdaq notifying the Company that as it has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Q1 Form 10 Q”) for the three months ended March 31, 2024, that the\nCompany is not in compliance with the Listing Rule.\nOn August 16, 2024, the Company received a notice (the “August Notice,\" and collectively with the Initial Notice and the May Notice, the “Notices”) from Nasdaq\nnotifying the Company that as it has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Q2 Form 10 Q,” and collectively with the 2023 Form 10-K and Q1 Form 10-Q,\nthe “Delinquent Filings”) for the six months ended June 30, 2024, that the Company is not in compliance with the Listing Rule for continued listing on Nasdaq\nThe Company previously submitted a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance with respect to the delinquent 2023 Form 10-K and Q1 Form 10-Q (the “Plan”), and Nasdaq\ngranted an exception until August 30, 2024, to file the delinquent 2023 Form 10-K and Q1 Form 10-Q. Pursuant to the August Notice, the Company is required to submit an\nupdate to the Plan to Nasdaq no later than September 3, 2024, to regain compliance with respect to the filing requirements. Nasdaq may grant the Company an additional\nexception of up to a maximum of 180 calendar days from the filing due date of the 2023 Form 10-K to file all Delinquent Filings, or until October 14, 2024, to regain\ncompliance.\nThe Notices do not have an immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s common stock. The Company is currently evaluating its options for regaining compliance.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will regain compliance with the Nasdaq’s rules or maintain compliance with any of the other Nasdaq continued listing\nrequirements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we accomplished the following:\n• The Company initiated a cost containment plan, recruitment, operations efforts, and significant customer acquisitions over the past year.\n• New Board Members: Welcomed Bruce Bernstein, an experienced securities industry leader; Marc Savas, a skilled executive known for accelerating company\nrevenue; Vice Admiral (ret.) Timothy Szymanski, a former Navy SEAL with over 36 years of service leveraging his expertise in special operations and national security;\nRajiv Srinivasan, a technology sales leader with senior roles at Microsoft, VMware, and a cybersecurity startup, and accredited U.S. Army veteran awarded with a Bronze\nStar.\n• Launched \"Use of Force Reduction Guarantee\": A new program affirming Wrap’s dedication to safer outcomes, guaranteeing a 10% reduction in an agency’s use of\nforce with BolaWrap or a device buyback after 12 months.\n• Strategic Redirection Announced: Transitioning Wrap Technologies from a product-focused entity to a mission-based solutions provider, paving the way for purpose-\ndriven innovation and growth.\n• Capital Funding and Acquisition: Closed a significant funding round with $10 million gross proceeds.\nAcquired Intrensic, LLC, expanding into body cam and Cloud evidence services.\n• Major Orders: Received a full deployment order for BolaWrap 150 from a large Mid-Atlantic domestic agency.\n• Successful Integration: Integrated Wrap Intrensic, enhancing our offerings in Body-Worn Cameras and Digital Evidence Management.\n• AI Advancements in Wrap Intrensic BWC: Launched new AI functionalities for Body-Worn Camera and Digital Evidence Management System, including AI Video\nRedaction and Automated Transcription, enhancing law enforcement efficiency and accountability.\n• BolaWrap 150 Expanded in Italy: Wrap Technologies announced the adoption of the BolaWrap 150 remote restraint devices by eleven police departments across\nItaly, underscoring the Company's commitment to advancing public safety solutions globally.\n- 32 -\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Outlook and Challenges\nWe believe our Company's products and solutions are gaining global recognition and awareness through various channels such as social media, trade shows, and media\nexposure, among others. In part, this recognition and awareness can be attributed to positive feedback from law enforcement agencies and the successful deployment of our\nproducts. As a result, we believe our brand is becoming increasingly recognized on a global scale as a leader in remote restraint and non-lethal solutions.\nIn addition, we are focused on marketing and public relations efforts. We believe there are market opportunities for our remote restraint and virtual reality solutions in the\nlaw enforcement and security sectors worldwide. These opportunities are driven by the increasing demand for less-lethal policing.\nIn the law enforcement sector, our BolaWrap product has been successfully deployed in the field, as reported by many agencies. BolaWrap is now in use by over 900 US\nlaw enforcement agencies and in 62 countries. Due to its safe remote restraint capabilities, some agencies do not deem its usage a categorical reportable use of force and\nrather place it underneath early use of force such as handcuffs. In our strategic roadmap, we clarified that law enforcement agencies deploy BolaWrap when verbal\ncommands breakdown but long before there is justifiable escalation to pepper spray, pepper ball, batons, bean bags, tasers or Conducted Electrical Weapons (CEW’s) or\nfirearms.\nSome agencies voluntarily report usage to Wrap but many do not. In the usage reports we have been provided, officers have reported successful outcomes in 84% of the use\ncases. This percentage is higher than what is often seen with less lethal tools. From the information we have been provided, the most common BolaWrap use case is for\nindividuals with behavioral health issues, and the second most common BolaWrap use case is during domestic violence calls. 26% percent of the reported persons who are\nwrapped with the BolaWrap are thought to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\nThere are many reasons why we may not receive reports on all the use of the BolaWrap, including, when uses of BolaWrap are considered evidence in ongoing criminal\ncases, are controlled by local policy or regulation, or require officer and union permission to be shared with us. However, some agencies have shared bodycam footage of\nsuccessful field deployments with us, which we may use in our training and education efforts. We believe that as the reports of BolaWrap's effectiveness in de-escalation\ncontinue to increase, it will contribute to our future revenue growth.\nWe anticipate and believe that our portfolio of safe, remote restraint products and training services has a strong and expanding pipeline of market opportunities in the law\nenforcement, military, corrections, and homeland security sectors both domestically and internationally. With the increasing demand for more humane and safer policing\npractices, we expect a continued surge in our global business. Currently, we are exploring major international business prospects while simultaneously seeking to establish\nrelationships with large police agencies in the US. However, we acknowledge that it is challenging to predict the exact timeline for closing these deals, or whether they will\nultimately materialize.\nAs part of our efforts to expand our sales and distribution operations, we provide a comprehensive training program for law enforcement officers and trainers in using the\nBolaWrap. This training equips them with knowledge about the appropriate use and limitations of BolaWrap in tandem with modern policing techniques for de-escalation of\nencounters. We now focus on also teaching when and why BolaWrap should be used, including the specific area of success, such as after verbal commands break down and\nbefore the law enforcement officer is ready to escalate to less lethal pain compliance tools. We believe that law enforcement trainers and officers who have been trained to\nuse our products, or have witnessed demonstrations, are more inclined to support the acquisition and deployment of our products by their respective departments to drive\nsuccessful outcomes. As of December 31, 2023, over 1,520 agencies have received BolaWrap training with over 5,440 training officers at those agencies certified as\nBolaWrap instructors and qualified to train the rest of their departments, representing a 12% increase in agencies and a 30% increase in trained officers as compared to\nDecember 31, 2022.\n- 33 -\nTable of Contents\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were relatively flat with 2023 expenses equal to $21.6 million as compared to $21.5 million in 2022. Our new\nmanagement team has prioritized reducing operating expenses, and in the second quarter, conducted a thorough top to bottom assessment of all aspects of the business. As a\nresult of these actions, the Company recorded $1.0 million of severance related charges during 2023. We expect to realize the results of the cost reduction actions beginning\nin 2024 as we expect to significantly reduce our cost profile. This assessment culminated in the creation of a strategic roadmap aimed at achieving sustainable growth and\ndelivering long-term value to our stockholders. Our strategic roadmap centers on expanding our sales by building repeatable domestic BolaWrap sales, increasing\ninternational sales of the new BolaWrap 150, and expanding the deployment of BolaWrap to full patrol-wide utilization via a customer success function. Additionally, we\nhave established a dedicated inside sales leader to increase our velocity on new leads. To catalyze sales growth, we are expanding our distributor and partner relationships\nwhile simultaneously diversifying and innovating our product offerings. As part of our strategic roadmap, we have made the decision to improve the pricing on BolaWrap\n150 devices and cassettes, given the product's success as a significant upgrade for law enforcement. We believe these increased margins could drive us to breakeven and\nprofitability more quickly. We also began charging for our respected training services.\nChanges have been implemented in how we sell Wrap Reality, and we have established a Software as a Service (SaaS) model for our virtual reality technology moving\nforward. We acquired cloud software capability and both on premise and cloud 3D Virtual Reality options for Wrap Reality in 2023. We anticipate these changes will have a\nsignificant positive impact on our future success and growth.\nWe believe the synergy in BolaWrap to de-escalate and reduce uses of force and the immersive 3D Virtual Reality training for law enforcement and corrections create a\nunique and well positioned law enforcement technology company that is prepared for modern policing and driving safe outcomes. With our key focus on where BolaWrap\nand Wrap Reality fit into the Force Factor diagram below in Figure X, agencies are likely to see significant increased usage where BolaWrap has shown to be a tool that\ncould appropriately de-escalate dangerous situations and save the lives and careers of officers and the individuals they interact with in such situations.\nManagement believes that implementing these strategic changes may lead to substantial sales growth and put us on a path towards sustainable profitability. Although\ngeopolitical tensions and macroeconomic challenges have affected our quarterly results in the past and may in the future, we believe our company is uniquely positioned to\nprovide lifesaving technologies and training that enable law enforcement officers worldwide to conduct safe and effective encounters while reducing the use of force. If\ndepartments follow our Use of Force Guarantee requirements, we have offered to buy back their BolaWrap devices if their reportable use of force is not reduced by 10%.\nWith an increasing addressable market, the Company offers what we believe is a unique value proposition. Our improved pricing strategy, coupled with reduced operating\nexpenses and our growing sales outlook, is expected to help reduce losses and improve cash flow in the future.\nWe plan to increase the number of product demonstrations and training sessions, particularly in international markets. Our new focus on the when and why BolaWrap is\nused has shown improved results. This is a departure from the hardware product only approach of the past. Our sales of the BolaWrap 150 and Wrap Reality are expected to\ncontinue to rise, aided by our ongoing cost savings and cost control measures, which we expect to lead to an overall reduction in cash burn.\n- 34 -\nTable of Contents\nWe have continued to invest in our VR system while working to continue to develop real-world scenarios into our robust Wrap Reality platform. We plan to increase\nmarketing activities for our VR solution to both law enforcement and corrections throughout 2023 and expect to launch the cloud-based version in mid-2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023 we had backlog of approximately $209 thousand was delivered in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, we had deferred revenue of\napproximately $544 thousand expected to be recognized generally over the next five years. Our deferred revenue is generally from Wrap Reality subscription and other\nrevenue. We expect our deferred revenue to grow in future years due to the SaaS business model on Wrap Reality. Distributor and customer orders for future deliveries are\ngenerally subject to modification, rescheduling or in some instances, cancellation, in the normal course of business.\nSince inception, we have generated significant losses from operations and anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses from operations for the foreseeable\nfuture. We believe that we have adequate financial resources to sustain our operations for the twelve months. For the year ended December 31, 2023 our net loss from\noperations increased by approximately $1.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Net cash used in operations during the year ended December 31, 2023\nwas approximately $2.1 million more than cash used in operations during the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase in cash used in operations reflects an increase in\naccounts receivable during the period along with an increase in the operating loss compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nWe expect that we will continue to innovate new applications for our public safety technology, open new geographies, develop new products and technologies to meet\ndiverse customer requirements and identify and develop new markets for our products.\nWe believe that our sales during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and to a lesser extent, December 31, 2023, were adversely affected by the shift to our BolaWrap\n150 product and the discontinuation of the BolaWrap 100 production line in 2022, along with the limited ability to demonstrate and train customers due to the COVID-19\npandemic, particularly internationally. Although customers were generally satisfied with the BolaWrap 100, many distributors were concerned with the Company’s ability to\ncontinue to expand with the BolaWrap 100. This device was completely discontinued in 2021 and product delays kept the BolaWrap 150 from being fully delivered to\ncustomers until late early 2022. This gap in having a product to sell as well as the unhappiness in phasing out the first-generation product while it was still having success in\nthe field, created significant work throughout 2022 to get the BolaWrap 150 approved by departments as well as by import and federal authorities for international countries.\nWe also had a much slower than expected trade in the timeframe of BolaWrap 100 to BolaWrap 150 due to the customer affinity for our first to market device.\nWe realized a rebound in sales of the BolaWrap 150 in the second half of 2022, following the full-scale production and sales of the BolaWrap 150. New device supply chain\nand product issues improved, but did not completely abate until the first half of 2023, at which point, management was able to fully resume international travel and\ndemonstrate the new and enhanced capabilities of the BolaWrap 150.\nSupply chain disruptions also affected our operations and could negatively impact our ability to source materials, manufacture and distribute products in the future.\nMoreover, financial markets continue to experience significant volatility, which could potentially affect our ability to enter into or modify favorable terms and conditions\nregarding equity and debt financing activities. Nevertheless, we had $11.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023, which\nwe believe provides sufficient capital to fund our operations in the short-term and absorb the potential near-term impacts of economic uncertainty. However, we may require\nadditional working capital and liquidity constraints and access to capital markets could still negatively affect our liquidity and require changes to our plan of operations.\nOur Company may be positively or negatively impacted by continued social unrest, protests against racial inequality, and movements like \"Defund the Police.\" Such unrest\nmay be further fueled by misleading information or negative publicity about our solutions. We believe our solutions are the answer to reducing use of force and driving safer\noutcomes for officers and the citizens they interact with each day. Although the intensity of these events may have subsided, some may still indirectly or directly, influence\npolice agency budgets and the funding available to current and potential customers. In addition, participants in these events may attempt to create the impression that our\nsolutions are contributing to the perceived problems, potentially harming our business and operations, including our revenues, earnings, and cash flows from operations.\nChanges in our management and other critical personnel have the potential to positively or negatively affect our business. Such disruptions could have an adverse impact on\nour operations, programs, growth, financial condition, or results of operations. On the other hand, improvements in our operations, operating expenses, and go-to-market\napproaches could positively influence the success of our business in the future.\n- 35 -\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the US (“US GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and judgments\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates, on an on-\ngoing basis, including those estimates related to recognition and measurement of contingencies and accrued expense. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in\ndetermining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, tax contingencies, unrecognized tax benefits, and any required valuation allowance, including\ntaking into consideration the probability of the tax contingencies being incurred. Management assesses this probability based upon information provided by its tax advisers,\nits legal advisers and similar tax cases. If later our assessment of the probability of these tax contingencies changes, our accrual for such tax uncertainties may increase or\ndecrease. Our effective tax rate for annual and interim reporting periods could be impacted if uncertain tax positions that are not recognized are settled at an amount which\ndiffers from our estimates.\nSome of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include share-based compensation and contingencies and areas\nsuch as revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory and intangible assets, estimates of product line exit costs, warranty liabilities and\nimpairments.\nRevenue Recognition. We sell our products to customers including law enforcement agencies, domestic distributors and international distributors and revenue from such\ntransactions is recognized in the periods that products are shipped (free on board (“FOB”) shipping point) or received by customers (FOB destination), when the fee is fixed\nor determinable and when collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured. We identify customer performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate\nthe transaction price to the performance obligations and recognize revenue as we satisfy the performance obligations. Our primary performance obligations are\nproducts/accessories and VR software licensing or sale. Our customers do not have the right to return product unless the product is found to be defective.\nShare-Based Compensation. We follow the fair value recognition provisions issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) in Accounting Standards\nCodification (“ASC”) Topic 718, Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”) and we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-07 for share-based transactions with non-\nemployees. Share-based compensation expense recognized includes stock option and restricted stock unit compensation expense. The grant date fair value of stock options\nis determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date is the date at which an employer and employee or non-employee reach a mutual understanding\nof the key terms and conditions of a share-based payment award. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs including the market price of the Company’s\nCommon Stock on the date of grant, the term that the stock options are expected to be outstanding, the implied stock volatilities of several publicly traded peers over the\nexpected term of stock options, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine. The\ngrant date fair value of restricted stock units is based upon the market price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of the grant. We determine the amount of share-\nbased compensation expense based on awards that we ultimately expect to vest and account for forfeitures as they occur. The fair value of share-based compensation is\namortized to compensation expense over the vesting term.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. Our products are sold to customers in many different markets and geographic locations. We estimate our bad debt reserve on a case-by-\ncase basis and the aging of accounts due to a limited number of customers mostly government agencies or well-established distributors. We base these estimates on many\nfactors including customer credit worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. Our\njudgments and estimates regarding collectability of accounts receivable have an impact on our financial statements.\nValuation of Inventory. Our inventory is comprised of raw materials, assemblies and finished products. We must periodically make judgments and estimates regarding the\nfuture utility and carrying value of our inventory. The carrying value of our inventory is periodically reviewed and impairments, if any, are recognized when the expected\nfuture benefit from our inventory is less than carrying value.\n- 36 -\nTable of Contents\nValuation of Intangible Assets. Intangible assets consisted of (a) capitalized legal fees and filing expense related to obtaining patents and trademarks, (b) customer\nagreements, tradenames, software, non-solicitation and non-compete agreements acquired in business combinations and valued at fair value at the acquisition date, and (c)\nthe purchase cost of indefinite-lived website domains. We must make judgments and estimates regarding the future utility and carrying value of intangible assets. The\ncarrying values of such assets are periodically reviewed and impairments, if any, are recognized when the expected future benefit to be derived from an individual intangible\nasset is less than carrying value. This generally could occur when certain assets are no longer consistent with our business strategy and whose expected future value has\ndecreased.\nAccrued Expense. We establish a warranty reserve based on anticipated warranty claims at the time product revenue is recognized. This reserve requires us to make\nestimates regarding the amount and costs of warranty repairs we expect to make over a period of time. Factors affecting warranty reserve levels include the number of units\nsold, anticipated cost of warranty repairs, and anticipated rates of warranty claims. We have very limited history to make such estimates and warranty estimates have an\nimpact on our financial statements. Warranty expense is recorded in cost of revenues. We evaluate the adequacy of this reserve each reporting period.\nWe use the recognition criteria of FASB ASC Topic 450-20, Loss Contingencies, to estimate the amount of bonuses when it becomes probable a bonus liability will be\nincurred and we recognize expense ratably over the service period. We accrue bonus expense each quarter based on estimated year-end results, and then adjust the actual in\nthe fourth quarter based on our final results compared to targets.\nHistorically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. Other than the planned\nproduction change requiring a new estimate of exit expense, there were no significant changes or modification of our critical accounting policies and estimates involving\nmanagement valuation adjustments affecting our results for the period ended December 31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNew pronouncements issued for future implementation are discussed in Note 1 to our financial statements.\nSegment and Related Information\nThe Company operates as a single segment. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is Scot Cohen, the Company’s Executive Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer, who manages operations for purposes of allocating resources. Refer to Note 18, Major Customers and Related Information, in our financial statements for further\ndiscussion.\nOperating Expense\nOur operating expenses include (i) selling, general and administrative expense, (ii) research and development expense, (iii) and in the most recent fiscal quarter, product line\nexit expense. Research and development expense is comprised of the costs incurred in performing research and development activities and developing production on our\nbehalf, including compensation and consulting, design and prototype costs, contract services, patent costs and other outside expense. The scope and magnitude of our future\nresearch and development expense is difficult to predict at this time and will depend on elections made regarding research projects, staffing levels and outside consulting\nand contract costs. The future level of selling, general and administrative expense will be dependent on staffing levels, elections regarding expenditures on sales, marketing\nand customer training, the use of outside resources, public company and regulatory expense, and other factors, some of which are outside of our control.\nWe expect our operating costs will remain at comparable current levels in the near term. We may also incur additional non-cash share-based compensation costs depending\non future option and restricted stock unit grants that are impacted by stock prices and other valuation factors. Historical expenditures are not indicative of future\nexpenditures.\n- 37 -\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to year ended December 31, 2022\nThe following table and narrative sets forth for the periods indicated certain items of our statement of operations, expressed in thousands of dollars. The financial\ninformation and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022 $ %\n(in thousands)\nRevenues:\nProduct sales $ 5,337 $ 7,481 $ (2,143) (29)%\nOther revenue 796 568 228 40%\nTotal revenues 6,133 8,049 (1,915) (24)%\nCost of revenues\nProducts and services 3,227 4,315 (1,088) (25)%\n- %\nGross profit 2,906 3,734 (828) (22)%\nOperating expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative 18,361 16,386 1,975 12%\nResearch and development 3,267 5,078 (1,811) (36)%\nTotal operating expenses 21,628 21,464 164 1%\nLoss from operations $ (18,722) $ (17,730) $ (1,033) (6)%\nRevenue\nWe reported revenue of approximately $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to revenue of approximately $8.0 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, an approximate 29% decrease. International revenues decreased from approximately $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to\napproximately $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in international revenue was driven by the prior year having certain large orders and\ncontinued stronger demand for our products in the EMEA region during 2022. We incurred discounts of approximately $169 thousand during the year ended December 31,\n2023, compared to approximately $898 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of promotional programs designed to encourage domestic\ncustomers to upgrade to the BolaWrap 150. We expect a decline to minimal discounts in 2024 as we have phased out our promotional upgrade offer.\nInternational revenue generally consists of larger orders with the end user being large, centralized government agencies. These orders continue to be lumpy and difficult to\npredict as to both timing and amount. We anticipate a revenue increase in 2024 compared to 2023 for two key reasons: (i) from an international perspective, there is growing\ndemand for less-lethal alternatives like BolaWrap, especially in regions where lethal force is often prohibited, and (ii) from a domestic perspective, despite a saturated\nmarket for less-lethal use-of-force solutions, BolaWrap stands out as what we believe to be the only pain-free compliance tool.\nWe incurred product promotional costs of approximately $249 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2023, related primarily to BolaWrap 150 demonstration products\nand the cost of training products and accessories delivered to law enforcement agencies that were expensed as marketing costs. We are responding to increased demand for\ntraining as a result of expanded product and brand awareness and increased successful field use by agencies but due to awareness expect reductions in product promotional\ncosts from 2022. A total of approximately $688 thousand of such product promotional costs were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s deferred revenue of approximately $544 thousand consisted of approximately $139 thousand related to BolaWrap extended\nwarranties and services, approximately $216 thousand related to Intrensic extended warranties and services, $171 thousand related to VR, and $18 thousand related to\nincreased training for Wrap Reality and BolaWrap extended warranties.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had backlog of approximately $209 thousand which was delivered in the first quarter of 2024. Distributor and customer orders for future\ndeliveries are generally subject to modification, rescheduling or in some instance’s cancellation in the normal course of business.\n- 38 -\nTable of Contents\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $2.9 million, or a gross margin of 47%. Our gross profit for year ended December 31, 2022 was\napproximately $3.7 million, or a gross margin of 46%. For the year ended December 31, 2023, gross profit represented a 22% decrease compared to December 31, 2022, as\na result of lower sales slightly offset by continued cost containment efforts on production.\nAs our revenue history is limited, historical margins may not accurately reflect future margins. However, we expect higher margins with the production of the BolaWrap\n150 compared to previous production due to design changes and improved pricing. Our margins are also subject to variations based on the sales channels and product mix\nthrough which our products are sold. At present, our cassettes have lower margins than the BolaWrap devices. As we scale cassette production, we will look to reduce our\ncosts and drive higher cassette margins. Cassettes were a total of 19.5% of our overall revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023, and may continue to grow as a\nrecurring revenue base as more BolaWrap devices are used in the field and as the use of BolaWrap increases due to the need of officers to de-escalate to prevent injuries and\nthe use of higher levels of force.\nWe regularly introduce updates and revisions to our products, which may include changes to raw materials and components, and can impact our product costs. Given our\nlimited experience with warranty costs, our estimated future warranty expense may affect our gross margins.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense increased by approximately $2.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, due to one-time costs associated with severance, the Intrensic acquisition, and the Company’s financing.\nAdvertising and promotion costs were approximately $1.2 million during the year December 31, 2023, or a decrease of approximately $0.1 million as compared to\napproximately $1.1 million during the year December 31, 2022. The decrease in advertising costs was related to reductions in consultants and other cost containment\nefforts.\nShare-based compensation costs allocated to SG&A was $1.5 for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of approximately $1.2 million, compared to approximately\n$2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease resulted primarily due to changes in management, one-time costs in the prior year period, and changes in\nthe Company’s stock price.\nSalaries and burden costs was $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an approximately $0.5 million or 8% decrease compared to approximately $6.5 million\nfor year ended December 31, 2022. During 2023, we recorded approximately $1.0 million of severance cost related to management restructuring efforts. During year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, we increased professional fees by approximately $0.8 million, and increased consulting and contract services fees by\napproximately $350 thousand. We expect expenditures for SG&A expense in 2024 to be slightly lower than 2023, as a result of restructuring actions taken in late 2023 and\nearly 2024.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense was approximately $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of approximately $1.8 million, compared to $5.1\nmillion for year ended December 31, 2022. In 2023, we incurred a $252 thousand period over period decrease in share-based compensation expense allocated to research\nand development expense as a result of personnel changes made in April 2023. Outside consulting costs decreased by $332 thousand and prototype related costs decreased\nby $443 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to reduced costs related to finalizing the BolaWrap 150 product.\nOperating Loss\nLoss from operations during the year December 31, 2023 was approximately $18.8 million, an increase of approximately $1.1 million compared to approximately $17.7\nmillion during the year December 31, 2022, reflecting increased margin and the Company’s focus on reducing operating costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary source of liquidity to date has been funding from our stockholders from the sale of equity securities and the exercise of derivative securities, consisting of\noptions and warrants. We expect our primary source of future liquidity will be from the sale of products, exercise of stock options and warrants and from future equity or\ndebt financings.\n- 39 -\nTable of Contents\nWe have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately\n$4.0 million, negative working capital of approximately $2.3 million primarily reflecting the approximate $19.7 value of the Series A Warrants (as defined herein) recorded\nin connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock in July 2023, and had sustained cumulative losses attributable to stockholders of approximately $98.0\nmillion. Our working capital net of the Warrants-short term at December 31, 2023 was approximately $17.4, a decrease of approximately $6.3 million compared to\nDecember 31, 2022, as a result of the operating losses offset by an increase in inventories of approximately $1.8 million, an increase in customer deposits totaling\napproximately $1.0 million in 2023 and the receipt of $8.9 million in net proceeds from the Offering.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, including the related notes (collectively referred\nto as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position\nof the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required\nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for\nthe purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial\nstatements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation\nof the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts\nor disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation and estimation of warrants and convertible preferred stock\nAs discussed in Note 1, 4, 10 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, on June 29, 2023, the Company sold for $10 million in gross proceeds via private\nplacement: (i) warrants to acquire the Company’s Common Stock, and (ii) the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The warrants are classified as liabilities\nat their fair value using the modified Black-Scholes option pricing model whereas the preferred stock are classified as equity. We identified the evaluation and\nestimation of the warrants and convertible preferred stock as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the Company’s estimation of stock price volatility, dividend yield and\nexpected life, involved auditor judgment.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the appropriateness of the Company’s evaluation and\nestimation of the warrants and the preferred stock by;\n● evaluating the design and testing the implementation of certain internal controls related to the process of accounting and estimating the value of the warrants\nand the preferred stock\n● reviewing the agreements pertaining to the offering transaction\n● evaluating the method and certain assumptions used\n● testing the application of the method and certain assumptions used\n/s/ HTL International, LLC\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2024.\nHouston, TX\nAugust 28, 2024\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Wrap Technologies, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Wrap Technologies, Inc.

ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOrganization and Business Description\nWrap Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”), is a publicly traded company with its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share\n(“Common Stock”), listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the trading symbol “WRAP”. The Company is a developer and supplier of public safety products\nand training services for law enforcement and security personnel. The Company’s primary product is the BolaWrap® remote restraint device. The principal markets for the\nCompany’s proprietary products and services are in North and South America, Europe, Middle East and Asia.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Company has two wholly owned subsidiaries, Wrap Reality, Inc., an Arizona corporation, formed in December 2020 that sells a virtual reality (“VR”) training system\nprimarily targeting law enforcement agencies and Intrensic, LLC, which the Company acquired in August 2023, which specializes in Body Worn Camera and Digital\nEvidence Management solutions. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of these subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions and\naccounts.\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (“US GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions (e.g., share-based compensation valuation, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory and intangible\nassets, warranty reserve, accrued costs, valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets and recognition and measurement of contingencies) that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nConcentrations of Risk\nCredit Risk – Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consisted primarily of cash, cash equivalents, US treasury bills and\naccounts receivable from customers. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalent deposits at two domestic financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit\nrisk in the event of default by a financial institution to the extent that cash and cash equivalents are in excess of the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-credit quality financial institutions and are managed within established guidelines to mitigate\nrisks. To date, the Company has not experienced any losses on its cash and cash equivalents.\nConcentrations of Accounts Receivable and Revenue – The Company has a limited number of domestic and international customers. The Company may experience\nconcentrations in both accounts receivable and revenue due to the timing of sales and collections of related payments (see Note 18).\nConcentration of Suppliers – The Company assembles its BolaWrap products in-house using components and subassemblies from a limited number of suppliers and\ncontract suppliers. In particular, a single supplier is currently the sole manufacturer of the BolaWrap battery assembly, and another single supplier is the sole manufacturer\nof the propulsion component for BolaWrap cassettes. Other parts are solely sourced from other suppliers. If supplier shortages or logistic delays occur, or quality problems\narise, production schedules could be significantly delayed or costs significantly increased, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial\ncondition, results of operation and cash flows.\nF-8\nTable of Contents\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less from the purchase date to be cash equivalents. Cash\nequivalents consist primarily of amounts invested in Money Market Funds and US (“US”) Treasury bills and are stated at fair value.\nShort-Term Investments\nThe Company’s short-term investments consist of certificates of deposits and US Treasury bills with original maturities beyond three months at the date of purchase and one\nyear or less from the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2023, all of the Company’s short-term investments were classified as available-for-sale and are carried at\nestimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, unrelated to credit loss factors, included in other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of\nstockholders’ equity.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company follows the fair value recognition provisions issued by the FASB in ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”) and has adopted Accounting Standards\nUpdate (“ASU”) 2018-07 for share-based transactions with non-employees. Share-based compensation expense recognized during 2023 and 2022 includes stock option and\nrestricted stock unit compensation expense. The grant date fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date is the date\nat which an employer and employee or non-employee reach a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of a share-based payment award and approved by the\nCompany’s Board of Directors. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs including the market price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant,\nthe term that the stock options are expected to be outstanding, the implied stock volatilities of several publicly traded peers over the expected term of stock options, risk-free\ninterest rate and expected dividend. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine. The grant date fair value of restricted stock\nunits is based upon the market price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of the grant. We determine the amount of share-based compensation expense based on\nawards that we ultimately expect to vest and account for forfeitures as they occur. The fair value of share-based compensation is amortized to compensation expense over\nthe vesting term.\nLoss per Share\nBasic loss per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net loss, less any dividends, accretion or decretion, redemption or induced conversion, if any, on our Series A\nConvertible Preferred Stock, by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reported period.\nIn computing diluted EPS, we adjust the numerator used in the basic EPS computation, subject to anti-dilution requirements, to add back the dividends (declared or\ncumulative undeclared) applicable to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Such add-back would also include any adjustments to equity in the period to accrete the\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock to its redemption price, or recorded upon a redemption or induced conversion, if any. We adjust the denominator used in the basic EPS\ncomputation, subject to anti-dilution requirements, to include the dilution from potential shares resulting from the issuance of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock,\nrestricted stock units, and stock options. Stock options and restricted stock units exercisable or issuable for a total of 5,468,223 and 6,413,731 shares of Common Stock\nwere outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These securities are not included in the computation of diluted net loss per common share for the periods\npresented as their inclusion would be antidilutive due to losses incurred by the Company.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) requires that financial assets measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be\ncollected. The expected credit losses are developed using an estimated loss rate method that considers historical collection experience, current conditions, and reasonable\nand supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The estimated loss rates are applied to accounts receivables with similar risk characteristics\nsuch as the length of time the balance has been outstanding and the location of the customer. In certain instances, the Company may identify individual accounts receivable\nassets that do not share risk characteristics with other accounts receivables, in which case the Company records its expected credit losses on an individual asset basis. If an\naccounts receivable asset is evaluated on an individual basis, the Company excludes those assets from the portfolios of accounts receivables evaluated on a collective basis.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had an allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable of $386 and $205, respectively. If a major customer’s\ncreditworthiness deteriorates, or actual defaults exceed our historical experience, such estimates could change and impact our future reported financial results.\nF-9\nTable of Contents\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of substantially all the Company’s inventory is determined by the FIFO cost method. Inventory is\ncomprised of raw materials, assemblies and finished products intended for sale to customers. The Company evaluates the need for reserves for excess and obsolete\ninventories determined primarily based upon estimates of future demand for the Company’s products.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022 the Company had $465 and $0 reserves, respectively for obsolescence.\nProperty, Equipment and Depreciation\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation on property and equipment is computed over the estimated useful lives of three years using the straight-line method.\nOn any retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed, and a gain or loss recorded.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for its business combinations under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 805-10, Business Combinations (\"ASC\n805-10\"), which requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including non-controlling\ninterests, are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The estimated fair value of net assets acquired, including the allocation of the fair value to\nidentifiable assets and liabilities, was determined using established valuation techniques. ASC 805-10 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business\ncombination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and\nintangible assets acquired in a business combination. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred.\nThe estimated fair value of the acquired intangible assets was determined using a method which reflects the present value of the operating cash flows generated by this asset\nafter taking into account the cost to realize the revenue, and an appropriate discount rate to reflect the time value and risk associated with the invested capital.\nCertain adjustments to the assessed fair values of the assets and liabilities made subsequent to the acquisition date, but within the measurement period, which is up to one\nyear, are recorded as adjustments to goodwill. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in income.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair values of the underlying net assets and liabilities assumed\nfrom an acquired business. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth\nquarter, or more frequently if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist. The Company evaluates qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value and whether it is necessary to perform goodwill impairment process.\nDefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets represent certain trade names, patents, licenses, software, acquired technology and customer relationships. Definite-lived intangible assets\nare recorded at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Definite-lived intangible assets acquired through the business\ncombination are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. The Company amortizes these acquired definite-lived intangibles assets with a finite life on a straight-line\nbasis, over 6 years for technology; 7 years for customer relationships; and 8 years for trademarks and trade names.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of (a) capitalized legal fees and filing costs related to obtaining patents and trademarks, (b) tradenames and software, (c) purchased software, and\n(d) the purchase cost of indefinite-lived website domains. The estimated useful lives of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful lives have been estimated to be\nbetween one and twenty years. Purchased website domain costs with an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization, but are subject to an annual impairment test, by\ncomparing their carrying amount with their corresponding fair value. For any given intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, if its fair value exceeds its carrying\namount no impairment loss shall be recognized.\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nThe carrying value of intangibles is periodically reviewed and impairments, if any, are recognized when the future undiscounted cash flows realized from the assets is less\nthan its carrying value.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets and identifiable intangibles held for use are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may\nnot be recoverable. If the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset or if changes in facts and circumstances indicate, an\nimpairment loss is recognized and measured using the asset’s fair value. In December 2023, it was determined that the intangible related to development of proprietary\nsoftware by Lumeto, Inc. would not have future economic value and was written down; the Company recognized an impairment loss of $700. The Company did not\nrecognize any impairment loss during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nWarrants\nThe Company accounts for warrants as liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC\n815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition\nof a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are\nindexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s\ncontrol, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and\nas of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.\nFor issued warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and\neach balance sheet date thereafter. The Company accounts for the warrants issued in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40-15-7C, under which the\nwarrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as liabilities. Accordingly, the Company classifies the warrants as liabilities at their fair value\nand adjusts the warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair\nvalue is recognized in the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nConvertible Preferred Stocks\nThe Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 480 and ASC 815 to determine if those\ninstruments or embedded components of those instruments qualify as derivatives and are subject to bifurcation accounting. The Company determines that the economic\ncharacteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. The convertible\ninstruments are accounted for as a single hybrid instrument. Additionally, the convertible instruments do not have any redemption features that would preclude permanent\nequity classification in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 480-10-S99.\nAdvertising and Promotion Costs\nAdvertising costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $925 and $426 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company also incurred\nproduct promotion costs for demonstration products delivered to prospective customers of $225 and $688 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAdvertising and promotion costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations.\nDemonstration and Training Costs\nThe Company maintains a demonstration and training department as a part of its sales and marketing activities and does not charge for product demonstrations or training.\nTraining is not a condition or requirement of sale as most sales are made through distributors to their end customers. The Company conducts local and regional in-person,\nwebinar and on-line demonstrations and use of force and escalation training to support law enforcement agencies with no purchase requirement. Such training, when\nprovided, may occur before or after initial or subsequent purchase or field deployment of the Company’s products. The Company believes that law enforcement trainers and\nofficers that have seen demonstrations or have been trained about its products are more supportive of their departments purchase and deployment of product.\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nContract Manufacturers\nThe Company employs contract manufacturers for production of certain components and sub-assemblies. The Company may provide parts and components to such parties\nfrom time to time but recognizes no revenue or markup on such transactions.\nLeases\nThe Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases (“Topic 842”) on January 1, 2019. In accordance with the guidance in Topic 842, the Company recognizes lease liabilities\nand corresponding right-of-use-assets for all leases with terms of greater than 12 months. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for in a manner similar\nto the guidance for operating leases prior to the adoption of Topic 842. Refer to Note 9, Leases for more information.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers on January 1, 2018. The Company enters into contracts that include various combinations\nof products, accessories, software and services, each of which are generally distinct and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. Product sales include\nBolaWrap products and accessories. Other revenue includes VR revenues, service, training and shipping revenues.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. The Company generally has an unconditional right to consideration when\ncustomers are invoiced, and a receivable is recorded. A contract asset is recognized when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or a contract liability (deferred revenue)\nwhen revenue will be recognized subsequent to invoicing. The Company recognizes an asset if there are incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer such as\ncommissions. These costs are ascribed to or allocated to the underlying performance obligations in the contract. The Company may receive consideration, per terms of a\ncontract, from customers prior to transferring goods to the customer. The Company records customer deposits as a contract liability. Additionally, the Company may receive\npayments, most typically for service and warranty contracts, at the onset of the contract and before the services have been performed. In such instances, a deferred revenue\nliability is recorded. The Company recognizes these contract liabilities as revenue after all revenue recognition criteria are met.\nEstimated costs for the Company’s standard warranty, generally one-year, are charged to cost of products sold when revenue is recorded for the related product. Royalties\nare also charged to cost of products sold.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nShipping and handling costs are included in cost of revenues. Shipping and handling costs invoiced to customers are included in revenue. Actual shipping and handling\ncosts were $200 and $296 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Actual revenues from shipping and handling were $37 and $109 for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nWarranty Reserves\nThe Company warrants its products and accessories to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of purchase. The warranty\nis generally limited. The Company currently provides direct warranty service. International market warranties are generally similar to the US market.\nThe Company establishes a warranty reserve based on anticipated warranty claims at the time product revenues are recognized. Factors affecting warranty reserve levels\ninclude the number of units sold, anticipated cost of warranty repairs and anticipated rates of warranty claims. The Company evaluates the adequacy of the provision for\nwarranty costs each reporting period. The warranty reserve was $72 and $125 at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Actual warranty costs could differ from estimates.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nSegment Information\nASC Topic 280, “Segment Reporting,” requires use of the “management approach” model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a\ncompany’s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company operates as a single segment and\nwill evaluate additional segment disclosure requirements as it expands its operations.\nIncome Taxes\nNo income tax expense was recorded for the periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 due to losses incurred. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on\ntemporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes.\nThe Company maintains a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets. The Company establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential likelihood of\nrealizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration the Company’s financial position and results of operations for the current period. Future realization of the\ndeferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carry-forward period under the Federal tax laws. Changes in circumstances, such as the\nCompany generating taxable income, could cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset. Any change in the valuation allowance will\nbe included in income in the year of the change in estimates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nThe Company has reviewed recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoptions of any such pronouncements will be\nexpected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of operations.\nIn July 2023, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-11216, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, requiring\ndisclosure of material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K and periodic disclosure of a registrant’s cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance in annual\nreports. Regulation S-K Item 6 disclosure requirements under this rule will be effective for us in the fourth quarter of 2023. Incident disclosure requirements in Form 8-K\nwill be effective for us on June 15, 2024. We are still evaluating for any impact on our financial statement disclosures from the adoption of this final rule.\n2. REVENUES AND PRODUCT COSTS\nRevenues consist of product revenue and other revenue. Product sales include BolaWrap products and accessories. Other revenue includes VR revenues, service, training\nand shipping revenues.\nThe table below details the activity in our contract liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCustomer Deferred\nDeposits Revenue\nBalance at January 1, 2023 $ - $ 333\nAdditions, net 1,002 407\nTransfer to revenue - (196)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 1,002 $ 544\nCurrent portion $ 1,002 $ 407\nLong-term portion $ - $ 137\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s deferred revenue of $544 consisted of $139 related to BolaWrap extended warranties and services, $216 related to Intrensic\nextended warranties and services, $171 related to VR, and $18 related to training.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company’s deferred revenue of $333 consisted of $198 related to VR, $11 related to training, and $124 related to BolaWrap extended\nwarranties and services.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nThe Company recognizes an asset if there are incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer such as commissions. These costs are ascribed to or allocated to the\nunderlying performance obligations in the contract and amortized consistent with the recognition timing of the revenue for any such underlying performance obligations.\nThe Company had no such assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company will apply the practical expedient to expense any sales commissions related to\nperformance obligations with an amortization of one year or less when incurred within selling, general and administrative expense.\n3. ASSET ACQUISITIONS\nPursuant to the Professional Services and Technology Acquisition Agreement (the “Services Agreement”), dated as of November 22, 2022, and as amended on April 2,\n2023, by and among the Company, Lumeto, Inc. (“Lumeto”) and Spatial Industries Group, Inc. (collectively, “Service Provider”), the Service Provider provides to the\nCompany certain technology, services, and perpetual licenses for use within the Company’s Wrap Reality virtual simulation training platform (the “Technology, Services,\nand License”), in consideration for a one-time cash payment upon the execution of the Services Agreement of $700,\nThe Company determined during 2023 that the intangible related to software developed by Lumeto would not have future economic benefit and the value of the intangible\nwas written off as a loss on impairment of $700.\nOn August 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Intrensic Purchase Agreement”) by and among the Company, certain\nmembers of Intrensic, including Kevin Mullins, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer (collectively, “Sellers”) and Buford Ortale, as the Seller’s representative.\nUnder the terms of the Intrensic Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to purchase, and Sellers agreed to sell, 100% of the membership interests (the “Membership\nInterests”) of Intrensic for the following consideration upon the consummation of the sale of the Membership Interests (the “Intrensic Closing”): (i) $553,588 in cash,\nsubject to adjustment based upon the outstanding indebtedness of Intrensic and Intrensic’s working capital as of the Intrensic Closing; and (ii) 1,250,000 shares of Common\nStock of the Company the “Intrensic Acquisition”). The Intrensic Acquisition closed on August 16, 2023, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement.\n4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nor disclosed at fair value, are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair values. The accounting guidance for fair value\nprovides a framework for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures about how fair value is determined. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received\nupon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The accounting guidance\nalso establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based upon whether such inputs are observable\nor unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions made by the reporting\nentity. The three-level hierarchy for the inputs to valuation techniques is briefly summarized as follows:\nLevel 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\nLevel 2—Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related\nassets or liabilities; and\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.\nThe Company’s short-term investments consisting of US Treasury bill securities and Certificate of Deposits are classified as Level 1 because they are valued using quoted\nmarket prices.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the Company’s short-term investments by significant investment category as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023\nAdjusted Unrealized Unrealized Market\nCost Gains Losses Value\nLevel 1:\nMoney Market Funds $ 1,793 $ - $ - $ 1,793\nCertificate of Deposits 7,500 - - 7,500\nTotal Financial Assets $ 9,293 $ - $ - $ 9,293\nAs of December 31, 2022\nAdjusted Unrealized Unrealized Market\nCost Gains Losses Value\nLevel 1:\nMoney Market Funds $ 3,004 $ - $ - $ 3,004\nU.S. Treasury securities in short-term investments 9,849 100 - 9,949\nCertificate of Deposits 4,000 - - 4,000\nTotal Financial Assets $ 16,853 $ 100 $ - $ 16,953\nUnrealized gains or losses resulting from our short-term investments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss as they are classified as available for\nsale. During the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, $0 and $100 was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss and gain, respectively.\nWarrant liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The subsequent measurement of the warrant liabilities as of December 31, 2023, is classified as Level 3\ndue to the use of an observable market quote in a non-active market and the management’s assumption of the expected stock price volatility.\nThe following table presents the fair value in the beginning of the period, the changes in the fair value, and the fair value at the end of the period of warrant liabilities:\nDecember 31,\nLevel 3: 2023\nFair value at inception or the beginning of the period $ (7,717)\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (11,986)\nFair value as of December 31, 2023 $ (19,703)\nThe Company uses the modified Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of warrant liabilities. The following table summarizes the assumptions used\nto compute the fair value of Warrants:\nAs of\nDecember 31,\n2023\nExpected stock price volatility 143%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.85%\nDividends yield 0%\nExpected life of warrants (years) 4.50\nExercise price $ 1.45\nOur other financial instruments also include accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and business acquisition liabilities. Due to the short-term nature of\nthese instruments, their fair values approximate their carrying values on the balance sheet.\n5. INVENTORIES\nInventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of substantially all the Company’s inventory is determined by the FIFO cost method. Inventories\nconsisted of the following:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nFinished goods $ 3,521 $ 2,293\nRaw materials 2,738 1,682\nReserve for Obsolescence (465) -\nInventories – net $ 5,794 $ 3,975\nF-15\nTable of Contents\n6. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nProduction and lab equipment $ 542 $ 513\nTooling 562 448\nComputer equipment 615 531\nFurniture, fixtures and improvements 196 181\n1,915 1,673\nAccumulated depreciation (1,406) (915)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 509 $ 758\nDepreciation expense was $479 and $475 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n7. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consisted of the following:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nAmortizable intangible assets:\nPatents $ 873 $ 575\nTrademarks 248 150\nPurchased software and technology 1,752 1,962\nCustomer Relationship 160 -\n3,033 2,687\nAccumulated amortization (806) (462)\nTotal amortizable 2,227 2,225\nIndefinite life assets (non-amortizable) 421 344\nTotal intangible assets, net $ 2,648 $ 2,569\nAmortization expenses were $345 and $287 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe purchase of Intrensic in August 2023 resulted in several intangible assets recognized on the balance sheet including $80 in trademarks, $490 in purchased technology\nand $160 in customer relationships.\nThe Company determined in December 2023 that the intangible related to software developed by Lumeto would not have future economic benefit and the value of the\nintangible was written down, incurring a loss on impairment of $700.\nAt December 31, 2023, annual amortization of intangible assets, based upon the Company’s existing intangible assets and current useful lives, is estimated to be the\nfollowing:\n2024 $ 427\n2025 422\n2026 335\n2027 185\n2028 185\nThereafter 673\nTotal estimated amortization expense $ 2,227\nF-16\nTable of Contents\nGoodwill\nThe table below summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill:\nBalance at January 1, 2023 $ -\nAcquired goodwill 1,610\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 1,610\nGoodwill acquired in 2023 relates to the purchase of Intrensic in August 2023.\n8. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\nWe are obligated to pay royalties pursuant to an exclusive Amended and Restated Intellectual Property License Agreement (the “License Agreement”), dated as of\nSeptember 30, 2016, with Syzygy Licensing, LLC (“Syzygy”), a private technology invention, consulting and licensing company owned and controlled by Elwood G.\nNorris, a founder and former officer and current 5% stockholder of the Company, and James A. Barnes, a former officer and stockholder of the Company (see Note 16).\nAccounts payable includes $14 and $127 due to Syzygy pursuant to the License Agreement as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAccrued liabilities consist of the following:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nPatent and legal costs $ 21 $ 135\nAccrued compensation 325 1,100\nWarranty costs 72 125\nTaxes and other 274 103\n$ 692 $ 1,463\nAccrued compensation includes $0 and $1,022 in employee bonuses and commissions payable at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nChanges in our estimated product warranty costs were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nBalance, beginning of period $ 125 $ 96\nWarranty settlements (169) (181)\nWarranty provision 116 210\nBalance, end of period $ 72 $ 125\n9. LEASES\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The guidance in FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases defines a lease as a contract, or part of a contract, that\nconveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment (an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Operating lease right\nof use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The\nCompany’s leases do not provide an implicit rate. Due to a lack of financing history or ability, the Company uses an estimate of low-grade debt rate published by the\nFederal Reserve Bank as its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.\nThe ROU asset includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nFor leases beginning on or after January 1, 2019, lease components are accounted for separately from non-lease components for all asset classes. On January 21, 2023, the\nCompany’s lease was amended to extend the expiration date to July 31, 2025. Upon execution of the amendment, which was deemed a lease modification, the Company\nreassessed the lease liability using the discount rate determined at the modification date and recorded an additional ROU asset for the same amount. The Company’s lease\ncontains renewal provisions and escalating rental clauses and generally requires the Company to pay utilities, insurance, taxes and other operating expenses. The renewal\nprovisions of the existing lease agreement were not included in the determination of the operating lease liabilities and the ROU assets. The Company also reassessed the\nlease classification and concluded that the lease continues to be an operating lease.\nAmortization of ROU operating lease assets was $138 and $101 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOperating lease expense for capitalized operating leases included in operating activities was $177 and $118 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOperating lease obligations recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2023 are:\nOperating lease liability- short term $ 616\nOperating lease liability - long term 1,671\nTotal Operating Lease Liability $ 2,287\nFuture lease payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities on the balance sheet at December 31, 2023 for future periods are as follows\n2024 $ 443\n2025 567\n2026 507\n2027 522\n2028 538\nThereafter 1,271\nTotal future minimum lease payments 3,848\nLess imputed interest (1,561)\nTotal $ 2,287\nThe weighted average remaining lease term is 6.77 years, and the weighted average discount rate is 14.2%.\nCertain leases contain provisions for payment of real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs by the Company. These expenses are treated as variable lease payments\nand recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred. The Company had $8 and $39 variable lease expenses during the year December 31,\n2023 or 2022.\nThe Company had $92 and $11 short-term lease expense during the year December 31, 2023, or 2022. The Company does not have any finance leases.\n10. WARRANTS\nOn June 29, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Series A Purchase Agreement”) with certain directors of the Company and certain\naccredited and institutional investors (collectively, the “Series A Investors”), pursuant to which it agreed to sell to the Series A Investors in a registered direct offering (the\n“Series A Offering”) (i) an aggregate of 10,000 shares of the Company’s newly-designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, with par value $0.0001 per share and a\nstated value of $1,000 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), initially convertible into up to 6,896,553 shares of the Company’s common stock, at an initial conversion\nprice of $1.45 per share (the “Conversion Price”), and (ii) warrants to acquire up to an aggregate of 6,896,553 shares of Common Stock (the “Series A Warrants”).\nEach Series A Warrant has an exercise price of $1.45, became exercisable after the date that was six months from the date of issuance and will expire 5 years following the\ndate of issuance. The exercise price is subject to customary adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, reclassifications and the like, and subject to price-based\nadjustment, on a “full ratchet” basis, in the event of any issuances of Common Stock, or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock, at a price\nbelow the then-applicable exercise price (subject to certain exceptions). The closing of the Offering occurred on July 3, 2023. The aggregate gross proceeds from the\nOffering were $10,000, of which $7,717 was allocated to the Warrants. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the Offering for general corporate purposes.\nF-18\nTable of Contents\n11. DEBT\nThe Company’s debt at December 31, 2023 and 2022 included operating lease liabilities (see Note 9).\n12. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nThe Company’s authorized capital consists of 150,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Preferred\nStock”), of which 10,000 are designated as Series A Preferred Stock.\nOn July 3, 2023, the Company filed the Certificate of Designations with the State of Delaware, designating 10,000 shares of its Preferred Stock as Series A Convertible\nPreferred Stock. The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock are as set forth in the form of Certificate of Designations of the Series A Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of\nDesignations”). The Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock (the “Conversion Shares”) at the election of the holder at any time at an initial\nconversion price of $1.45. The Conversion Price is subject to customary adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, reclassifications and the like, and subject to price-\nbased adjustment in the event of any issuances of common stock, or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for common stock, at a price below the then-\napplicable Conversion Price (subject to certain exceptions).\nThe holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends of 8% per annum, compounded monthly, which are payable in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a\ncombination thereof, at the Company’s option in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designations. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a\nTriggering Event (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), the Series A Preferred Stock will accrue dividends at the rate of 20% per annum. If the Company elects to\npay any dividends in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price used to calculate the number of shares issuable will equal to the lower of (i) the then applicable\nConversion Price and (ii) 85% of the arithmetic average of the three (3) lowest closing prices of the Common Stock during the twenty (20) consecutive trading day period\nending on the trading day immediately preceding the dividend payment date, provided that such price shall not be lower than the lower of (x) $0.2828 (subject to adjustment\nfor stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, recapitalizations or other similar events ) and (y) 20% of the “Minimum Price” (as defined in Nasdaq Stock Market\nRule 5635) on the date of the Stockholder Approval (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, recapitalizations or other similar events) or,\nin any case, such lower amount as permitted, from time to time, by the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nThe holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have no voting rights, other than with respect to certain matters affecting the rights of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe Company may require holders to convert their shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock if the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock\nexceeds $8.00 per share (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations, recapitalizations or other similar events) for 20 consecutive trading\ndays and the daily dollar trading volume of the Common Stock exceeds $2,000,000 per day during the same period, provided that certain equity conditions described in the\nCertificate of Designations are satisfied.\nAt any time beginning 18 months from the date of the issuance, provided that provided that that the Company has filed all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to the\nExchange Act on a timely basis for a continuous period of one year and provided further that certain equity conditions described in the Certificate of Designations are\nsatisfied, the Company has the right to redeem in cash all or some of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at such time at a redemption price equal to the\nproduct of (x) 125% multiplied by (y) the sum of (A) the stated value of the Series A Preferred Stock plus (B) all declared and unpaid Dividends on such Preferred Stock\nand any other unpaid amounts then due and payable hereunder with respect to such Series A Preferred Stock, plus (C) the make-whole amount, plus (D) any accrued and\nunpaid late charges with respect to such stated value and amounts payable pursuant to clause (B) as of such date of determination.\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nOn August 19, 2024, the Company entered into an Amendment Agreement (the “Series A Amendment”) with the Required Holders (as defined in the Certificate of\nDesignations). Pursuant to the Series A Amendment, the Required Holders agreed that (A) the unpaid and accrued dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock due July 1,\n2024 (the “July Delinquent Dividend Amount”), shall be payable, at the option of the Company, in (i) cash and/or (ii) shares of Common Stock, at a price per share of\nCommon Stock equal to the lower of (x) $1.00 and (y) the Dividend Conversion Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), using July 1, 2024, as the applicable\ndate of determination in accordance with the Certificate of Designations; (B) the dividends due on October 1, 2024 (the “October Dividend Amount” and, together with the\nJuly Delinquent Dividend Amount, the “Delinquent Dividend Amounts”), shall be payable in shares of Common Stock based on a per share price of Common Stock equal\nto 80% of the arithmetic average of the three (3) lowest closing sale prices of the Common Stock during the month of September 2024; and (C) such Delinquent Dividend\nAmounts and any Dividend Balance Shares (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), with respect thereto, if applicable, shall be delivered on October 1, 2024. The\nCompany and the Required Holders further agreed pursuant to the Agreement to amend (i) the Certificate of Designations, as described below, by filing a Certificate of\nAmendment to the Certificate of Designations (the “Certificate of Amendment”) and (ii) the Series A Purchase Agreement to amend the definition of “Excluded Securities.”\nThe Certificate of Amendment amends the Certificate of Designations to, among other things, (A) allow for the payment of dividends in the form of Common Stock to a\nholder of the Series A Preferred Stock who serves as a director, officer or employee of the Company; provided that such issuance is approved by the Company’s\nstockholders prior to such issuance, and (B) amend certain conditions required for (i) a mandatory conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii) the Company’s right\nto redeem, all or a portion, of the Series A Preferred Stock outstanding pursuant to an optional redemption, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of\nDesignations. The Certificate of Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on August 23, 2024.\n$2,036 of the net proceeds less transaction cost of the Series A Purchase Agreement was allocated to the Series A Preferred Stock. For the year ended December 31, 2023,\nauthorized and declared dividends totaling $392 of which $58 was paid in cash $232 was paid in shares of the Company’s Common Stock and the balance of $102 was\naccrued in payables as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, 102 Shares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted into approximately 77 thousand shares of\nCommon Stock.\nThe Company’s failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2024 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, each constituted a Triggering Event (the “Filing Triggering Events”) and equity\nconditions failures pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designations. As a result, the dividend rate of the Series A Preferred Stock was automatically increased to 20%\nper annum beginning on April 16, 2024, or the filing deadline of the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and shall continue until such date as the Filing\nTriggering Event is cured. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Filing Triggering Event has not been cured.\n13. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nOn March 31, 2017, the Company adopted, and the stockholders approved, the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) authorizing 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock for\nissuance as awards to employees, directors or consultants. In May 2019, the stockholders authorized an increase in the Plan authorizing an additional 2,100,000 shares of\nCommon Stock, in June 2020 authorized an additional 1,900,000 shares of Common Stock, in June 2021 authorized an additional 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock and\nin June 2022 authorized an additional 1,500,000 shares of Common Stock, for a total of 9,000,000 shares subject to the Plan. At December 31, 2023, there were 1,391,183\nshares of Common Stock remaining available for grant under the Plan.\nThe Company generally recognizes share-based compensation expense on the grant date and over the period of vesting or period that services will be provided. In April\n2023, the Company recognized severance acceleration of $112 of share-based compensation expense resulting from the resignation of the Company’s former Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Operating Officer due to a reduction in force that resulted in changes in the composition of the executives of the Company.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nWeighted Average\nOptions on Remaining Aggregate\nCommon Exercise Contractual Intrinsic\nShares Price Term Value\nOutstanding January 1, 2023 5,491,399 $ 3.72 5.96 $ 92\nGranted 2,592,309 $ 1.68\nExercised (123,056) $ 1.69\nForfeited, cancelled, expired (3,303,017) $ 3.80\nOutstanding December 31, 2023 4,657,635 $ 2.52 8.75 $ 3,979\nExercisable December 31, 2023 1,160,580 $ 4.02 7.86 $ 274\nF-20\nTable of Contents\nAt December 31, 2023, there were 2,675,071 service-based stock options outstanding, and 1,982,564 performance-based stock options outstanding, of which 692,398\nperformance-based stock options were granted in April 2022 to the Company’s previous Chief Executive Officer and 1,290,166 were granted in October 2023 to the\nCompany's current Chief Executive Officer subject to future market capitalization targets.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of service-based options granted. The following table summarizes the assumptions\nused to compute the fair value of options granted to employees and non-employees:\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nExpected stock price volatility 76% 49%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.21% 2.47%\nForfeiture rate 0% 0%\nExpected dividend yield 0% 0%\nExpected life of options – years 6.00 5.96\nWeighted-average fair value of options granted $ 1.33 $ 0.88\nEstimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Company’s stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of awards. The Company’s\nestimated volatility was based on an average of the historical volatility of peer entities whose stock prices were publicly available. The Company’s calculation of estimated\nvolatility is based on historical stock prices of these peer entities over a period equal to the expected life of the awards. The Company uses the historical volatility of peer\nentities due to the lack of sufficient historical data of its stock price. The Company records forfeitures as they are incurred.\nThe risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds whose maturity period is appropriate for the term of the\noptions. The dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and has no present intention to pay cash dividends. The Company\ncalculates the expected life of the options using the Simplified Method for the employee stock options as the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data.\nThe Company used the Monte Carlo Simulation Model to value at the grant date the aggregate of 1,290,166 market condition performance options granted in October 2023\nto the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. The assumptions used in the Monte Carlo Simulation were stock price on date of grant of $1.40, contract term of 10 years,\nexpected volatility of 76% and risk-free interest rate of 4.65 %. Vesting is based on sustained market capitalization of $100 million, $150 million and $200 million and\nexpected to be exercised at the midpoint of the vesting period resulted in implied service periods ranging from approximately 1 to 3 years.\nStock option expense was $967 and $1,770 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2023:\nWeighted\nAverage Weighted Weighted\nRemaining Average Average\nRange of Number Contractual Exercise Number Exercise\nExercise Prices Outstanding Life (Years) Price Exercisable Price\n1.00 – 2.00 2,084,503 9.59 $ 1.44 75,527 $ 1.79\n2.01 – 3.00 1,675,699 8.00 $ 2.76 487,967 $ 2.69\n3.01 – 4.00 250,000 10.00 $ 3.10 - $ -\n4.01 – 25.00 647,433 5.57 $ 5.39 597,086 $ 5.39\nF-21\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Plan provides for the grant of restricted stock units (“RSUs”).

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN\nThe Company has a defined contribution savings plan for all eligible U.S. employees established under the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This\nplan was formed on January 1, 2022. Eligible employees may contribute a percentage of their salary subject to certain limitations. The Company’s contributions for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $0 and $0, respectively.\n15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nFacility Lease\nIn November 2023, the Company commenced a lease in an office building located at 3480 Main Highway, Coconut Grove, Florida. The lease of 4,487 square feet for an\ninitial term of 94 months, including 5 months of rent abatement in the first two years of the lease. The aggregate monthly payments will restart in 2024 for $40 per month,\nincreasing 3% each year through the lease term, plus other certain costs and charges as specified in the lease agreement.\nF-22\nTable of Contents\nOur executive offices, sales, training, assembly, and warehouse facilities are located at 1817 West 4th Street, Tempe, Arizona. The lease of 11,256 square feet commenced in\nJune 2019 and was for an initial lease term through July 2022. In January 2022 we renewed this lease for three years with aggregate monthly payments of $10 commencing\nAugust 2022, increasing 4% annually through the term ending July 31, 2025.\nRelated Party Technology License Agreement\nThe Company is obligated to pay royalties and development and patent costs pursuant to an exclusive Amended and Restated Intellectual Property License Agreement dated\nas of September 30, 2016, with Syzygy, a company owned and controlled by stockholder/consultant Mr. Elwood Norris and stockholder/consultant Mr. James Barnes. The\nagreement provides for royalty payments of 4% of revenue from products employing the licensed ensnarement device technology up to an aggregate of $1,000 in royalties\nor until September 30, 2026, whichever occurs earlier. The Company recorded $199 and $274 for royalties incurred during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Maximum payout still available under this arrangement is $81.\nPurchase Commitments\nAt December 31, 2023 the Company was committed for approximately $662 for future component deliveries that are generally subject to modification or rescheduling in\nthe normal course of business\nIndemnifications and Guarantees\nOur officers and directors are indemnified as to personal liability as provided by the Delaware law and the Company’s articles and bylaws. The Company may also\nundertake indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business related to its operations. The Company is unable to estimate with any reasonable accuracy the\nliability that may be incurred pursuant to any such indemnification obligations now or in the future. Because of the uncertainty surrounding these circumstances, the\nCompany’s current or future indemnification obligations could range from immaterial to having a material adverse impact on its financial position and its ability to continue\nin the ordinary course of business. The Company has no liabilities recorded for such indemnities.\nRegulatory Agencies\nThe Company is subject to oversight from regulatory agencies regarding firearms that arises in the ordinary course of its business.\nLitigation\nThe Company is subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a provision for a liability relating to legal matters when it is\nboth probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed and adjusted to include the impacts of\nnegotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. At December 31, 2023, we had\nno provision for liability under existing litigation.\n16. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nOn June 29, 2023, the Company entered into the Series A Purchase Agreement with certain investors, including Scot Cohen, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, and\nV4 Global LLC (“V4”).

INCOME TAXES\nUntil its reverse recapitalization on March 31, 2017, the Company was treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes and did not incur income taxes. The\nCompany accounts for income taxes under ASC 740. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and\ntax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Accounting\nstandards require the consideration of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is \"more likely than not\" that some component or all of the benefits of deferred tax\nassets will not be realized.\nThe provision/(benefit) for Income Taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, consists of the following:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nCurrent Tax Expense/(Benefit)\nDeferred Tax Expense/(Benefit) $ (4,333) $ 3,756\nChange in Valuation Allowance 4,333 (3,756)\nIncome Tax Provision/(Benefit) $ - $ -\nThe Company’s effective income tax rate is different from the federal statutory tax rate in 2023 predominantly due to the valuation allowance, permanent differences, and\nstate taxes. A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. Federal Tax Rate to the Company's Effective Tax Rate is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nU.S. Statutory Federal Income Tax Rate $ (6,355) $ 3,700\nState Income Taxes, net of Federal Income tax Benefit (421) 345\nPermanent differences and other 2,433 (289)\nValuation Allowance 4,333 (3,756)\nIncome Tax Provision/(Benefit) $ - $ -\nF-24\nTable of Contents\nDeferred income taxes represent the tax effect of transactions that are reported in different periods for financial and tax reporting purposes. The combined temporary\ndifferences and carryforwards of each tax paying component of the Company that give rise to a significant portion of the deferred income tax benefits and liabilities are as\nfollows as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nDeferred income tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryforwards $ 17,002 $ 14,898\nSec. 174 capitalization 1,494 -\nResearch and development credits 81 65\nStock Based Compensation 1,447 1,216\nAccruals and Other 995 324\nTotal deferred tax assets (gross) 21,018 16,503\nLess valuation allowance (20,302) (15,969)\nNet deferred tax assets 716 534\nDeferred income tax liabilities: - -\nDepreciation and other (716) (534)\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ (716) $ (534)\nNet deferred income taxes $ - $ -\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had available federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $703 which begin to expire in 2037, and approximately\n$78.8 million which will never expire. The Company has available state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $30.8 million as of December 31, 2023, which\nbegin to expire in 2037. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has federal research and development tax credits of approximately $81.\nThe Company has provided a valuation allowance against the Company’s deferred tax assets, since, in the opinion of management, based upon the earnings history of the\nCompany, it is not more likely than not that the benefits will be realized. All or a portion of the remaining valuation allowance may be reduced in future years based on an\nassessment of earnings sufficient to fully utilize these potential tax benefits.\nASC 740 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.

BUSINESS COMBINATION\nOn August 8, 2023, the Company entered into the Intrensic Purchase Agreement with the Sellers. The Intrensic Closing occurred on August 16, 2023. Under the terms of\nthe Intrensic Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to purchase, and Sellers agreed to sell, the Membership Interests for the following consideration at the Intrensic\nClosing: (i) $554 in cash, subject to adjustment based upon the outstanding indebtedness of Intrensic and Intrensic’s working capital as of the Intrensic Closing; and (ii)\n1,250,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company valued at approximately $1,938.\nThe Company assessed the historical financial information of Intrensic to determine if it would materially impact the Company’s historical financial statements for the\npurposes of disclosing proforma financial information.

Holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of at a meeting of\nstockholders. There is no cumulative voting of the election of directors then standing for election. The common stock is not entitled to pre-emptive rights and is not subject\nto conversion or redemption. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. All outstanding shares of common stock are, when sold,\nvalidly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Board is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock without further action by the holders of common stock. The shares of preferred stock may be issued\nfrom time to time in one or more series, each of which will have such distinctive designation or title as shall be determined by the Board prior to the issuance of any shares\nthereof.\nThe Board is authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by law, to fix by resolution or resolutions the designations, powers, preferences, and rights and the qualifications,\nlimitations, or restrictions thereof, of each such series of preferred stock, including without limitation, authority to fix by resolution or resolutions the dividend rights,\ndividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions), redemption price or prices, and liquidation preferences of\nany wholly unissued series of preferred stock, and the number of shares constituting such series and the designation thereof, or any of the foregoing.\nThe issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock and, therefore, reduce the value of the common stock. It is not possible to\nstate the actual effect of the issuance of any shares of preferred stock on the rights of holders of the common stock until the Board determines the specific rights of the\nholders of the preferred stock; however, these effects may include:\n● Restricting dividends on the common stock;\n● Diluting the voting power of the common stock;\n● Impairing the liquidation rights of the common stock; or\n● Delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by the stockholders.\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock\nThe following are the principal terms of the Series A Preferred Stock:\nDividends\nThe holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends of 8% per annum, compounded monthly, which are payable in cash or shares of Common Stock, or a\ncombination thereof, at the Company’s option in accordance with the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock Certificate of Designations (“Certificate of Designations”). Upon\nthe occurrence and during the continuance of a Triggering Event (as defined in the Certificate of Designations), the Series A Preferred Stock will accrue dividends at the rate\nof 20% per annum.\nVoting Rights\nThe Series A Preferred Stock has no voting rights, except as required by law (including without limitation, the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) and as\nexpressly provided in the Series A Certificate of Designation. To the extent that under the DGCL the vote of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock; provided, that such\nholders must include Iroquois Master Fund Ltd. (the “Required Holders”), voting separately as a class or series, as applicable, is required to authorize a given action of the\nCompany, the affirmative vote or consent of the Series A Preferred Stock of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together in the aggregate and not in separate series\nunless required under the DGCL, represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is presented or by written consent of the Required Holders (except as otherwise may\nbe required under the DGCL), voting together in the aggregate and not in separate series unless required under the DGCL, shall constitute the approval of such action by\nboth the class or the series, as applicable. To the extent that under the DGCL holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote on a matter with holders of shares of\ncommon stock, voting together as one class, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to cast that number of votes per share as is equal to the\nnumber of shares of common stock into which it is then convertible (subject to the ownership limitations specified in the Certificate of Designations) using the record date\nfor determining the stockholders of the Company eligible to vote on such matters as the date as of which the conversion price is calculated.\nLiquidation\nUpon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the each holder of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be\nentitled to receive out of the assets, whether capital or surplus, of the Company an amount per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the greater of (A) 150% of the\nstated value of such share of Series A Preferred Stock (plus any applicable make-whole amount, unpaid late charge or other applicable amount) on the date of such payment\nand (B) the amount per share such holder would receive if such holder converted such Series A Preferred Share into common stock immediately prior to the date of such\npayment.\nConversion\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock (the “Conversion Shares”) at the election of the holder at any time at an initial conversion price of\n$1.45 (the “Conversion Price”). The Conversion Price is subject to customary adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, reclassifications and the like, and subject to\nprice-based adjustment in the event of any issuances of common stock, or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for common stock, at a price below the then-\napplicable Conversion Price (subject to certain exceptions).\nExchange Cap\nThe Series A Certificate of Designations provide that the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be convertible into shares of common stock in excess of 19.99% of the shares of\ncommon stock outstanding as of the date immediately prior to the date of the prospectus supplement under which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock were registered (the\n“Issuable Maximum”) except in the event that the Company (A) obtains the stockholder approval for issuances of shares of common stock in excess of the Issuable\nMaximum or (“Stockholder Approval”) or (B) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not required. Until such approval or\nsuch written opinion was obtained, no holder of Series A Preferred Stock would be issued in the aggregate more shares of common stock than such holder’s pro rata share of\nthe Issuable Maximum. The Company received the Stockholder Approval on September 19, 2023.\nOptional Conversion\nThe Series A Preferred Stock can be converted at the option of the holder at any time and from time to time after the original issuance date; provided that, shares of Series A\nPreferred Stock held by a holder who serves as a director, officer or is an employee of the Company shall only be convertible into shares of Common Stock following\nreceipt of the Stockholder Approval.\nMandatory Conversion\nIf on any day after the issuance of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock the closing price of the Common Stock exceeds $8.00 per share (subject to adjustment for stock\nsplits, stock dividends, stock combinations, recapitalizations or other similar events) for 20 consecutive trading days and the daily dollar trading volume of the Common\nStock exceeds $2,000,000 per day during the same period, provided that certain equity conditions described in the Certificate of Designations are satisfied, then the\nCompany shall have the right to require the holder to mandatorily convert all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock, including the make-whole amount, the\nadditional amount and any accrued but unpaid late charges, as designated in a Mandatory Conversion Notice on the Mandatory Conversion Date (each as defined in the\nCertificate of Designations) into fully paid, validly issued and nonassessable shares of common stock at the then-applicable conversion price as of the Mandatory\nConversion Date (a “Mandatory Conversion”). If any of the equity conditions shall cease to be satisfied at any time on or after the Mandatory Conversion Date through and\nincluding the actual delivery of all of the Conversion Shares to the holders, the Mandatory Conversion shall be deemed withdrawn and void ab initio.\nBeneficial Ownership Limitation\nThe Series A Preferred Stock cannot be converted to Common Stock if the holder and its affiliates would beneficially own more than 4.99% or 9.99% at the election of the\nholder of the outstanding Common Stock. However, any holder may increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% upon notice to us,\nprovided that any increase in this limitation will not be effective until 61 days after such notice from the holder to the Company and such increase or decrease will apply\nonly to the holder providing such notice.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law and Specified Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws Provisions\nPreferred Stock. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock may enable the Board to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to gain control\nof the Company by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. For example, if in the due exercise of its fiduciary obligations, the Board were to determine\nthat a takeover proposal is not in the best interests of the Company or stockholders, the Board could cause shares of preferred stock to be issued without stockholder\napproval in one or more private offerings or other transactions that might dilute the voting or other rights of the proposed acquirer or insurgent stockholder or stockholder\ngroup. In this regard, the Articles of Incorporation grant the Board broad power to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock.\nThe issuance of shares of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of shares of common stock. The issuance\nmay also adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of these holders and may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of\nthe Company.\nStockholder Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders. The Articles of Incorporation and By-laws provide that stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or\nspecial meeting of stockholders and may not take action by written consent. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws further provide that special meetings of the\nCompany’s stockholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board or by the Board, and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board at the request of the holders of not\nless than a majority of all the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting.\nBusiness Combinations. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which relate to business combinations with interested stockholders, applies to the Company.\nSubject to certain exceptions, Section 203 prevents a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with any “interested stockholder” for\nthree years following the date that such person became an interested stockholder, unless either the interested stockholder attained such status with the approval of the Board,\nthe business combination is approved by the Board and stockholders in a prescribed manner or the interested stockholder acquired at least 85% of the Company’s\noutstanding voting stock in the transaction in which such person became an interested stockholder. A “business combination” includes, among other things, a merger or\nconsolidation involving the Company and the “interested stockholder” and the sale of more than 10% of the Company’s assets. In general, an “interested stockholder” is any\nentity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding voting stock and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such\nentity or person.\nAdvance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations. The Company’s Bylaws provide that stockholders seeking to bring business before an\nannual meeting of stockholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of stockholders, must meet specified procedural requirements.\nThese provisions may preclude stockholders from bringing matters before an annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at an annual or\nspecial meeting of stockholders.\nExclusive Forum Charter Provision. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws require that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent\npermitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for a stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring an action relating to the resolution of any complaint\nasserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, against any person in connection with any offering of the Company’s securities, including,\nwithout limitation and for the avoidance of doubt, any auditor, underwriter, expert, control person, or other defendant. Because the applicability of the exclusive forum\nprovision is limited to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company does not intend that the exclusive forum provision would apply to suits brought to enforce any\nduty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, and acknowledge that federal courts have\nconcurrent jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act. The Company notes that there is uncertainty as to whether a court\nwould enforce the provision and that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Although the Company\nbelieves this provision benefits the Company by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the\nprovision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against the Company’s directors and officers.\nDirectors’ Liability. The Articles of Incorporation limit the personal liability of directors to the Company or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary\nduty as a director to the maximum extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law and provides that no director will have personal liability to the Company or\nto its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty. However, these provisions do not eliminate or limit the liability of any of the Company’s directors:\n● for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the Company or its stockholders;\n● for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;\n● under the Delaware General Corporation Law; or\n● for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.\nExhibit 23.1\nCONSENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nWe consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statements on Form S-8 (No. 333-225102, 333-232314, 333-239234 and 333-260841) and Form S-3 (No.\n333-239329, 333-260612 and 333-275605) of our report dated August 27, 2024, relating to the consolidated financial statements of Wrap Technologies, Inc., as of and for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K of Wrap Technologies, Inc.\n/s/ HTL International, LLC\nHouston, Texas\nAugust 28, 2024\nExhibit 23.2\nCONSENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nWrap Technologies, Inc.\nTempe, Arizona\nWe consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statements (No. 333-225102, 333-232314, 333-239234 and 333-260841) on Form S-8 and (No. 333-\n239329, 333-260612 and 333-275605) on Form S-3 of Wrap Technologies, Inc. of our report dated March 2, 2023, relating to the consolidated financial statements of Wrap\nTechnologies, Inc., appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K of Wrap Technologies, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n/s/ Rosenberg Rich Baker Berman, P.A.\nSomerset, New Jersey\nAugust 28, 2024\nExhibit 31.1\nCERTIFICATION UNDER SECTION 302\nI, Scot Cohen, certify that:\n1.

Definitions:\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following terms have the meanings set forth below:\n● “Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under\nthe securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error (i) in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously\nissued financial statements (commonly referred to as a “Big R” restatement), or (ii) that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the\ncurrent period or left uncorrected in the current period (commonly referred to as a “little r” restatement).\n● “Board” means the Board of Directors of the Company.\n● “Committee” means the Compensation Committee of the Board.\n● “Effective Date” means October 2, 2023.\n● “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation\nthat otherwise would have been received by the Executive Officer had it been determined based on the restated amounts in the Accounting Restatement (computed\nwithout regard to any taxes paid). For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return (“TSR”), where the amount of Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the Accounting Restatement, the Company shall: (i) base the\ncalculation of the amount on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or TSR upon which the Incentive-Based\nCompensation received was based; and (ii) retain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to The Nasdaq\nStock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) or, if a class of securities of the Company is no longer listed on Nasdaq, such other national securities exchange or national\nsecurities association on which a class of the Company’s securities is then listed for trading.\n● “Executive Officer” means the Company’s current and former executive officers, as determined by the Board or the Committee in accordance with the definition\nof executive officer set forth in Rule 5608(d) of the Nasdaq Rules.\n● “Financial Reporting Measures” means measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the\nCompany’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures.

The following do not constitute Incentive-Based Compensation for purposes of this Policy: (a)\nequity awards for which (1) the grant is not contingent upon achieving any Financial Reporting Measure performance goals and (2) vesting is contingent solely\nupon completion of a specified employment period and/or attaining one or more nonfinancial reporting measures, and (b) bonus awards that are discretionary or\nbased on subjective goals or goals unrelated to Financial Reporting Measures.\n● “Nasdaq Rules” means the listing rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC.\n● “received”: An Executive Officer shall be deemed to have “received” Incentive-Based Compensation in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial\nReporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs\nafter the end of that fiscal period.\n● “Restatement Date” means the earlier to occur of (i) the date the Board or the Committee (or an officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if\nBoard action is not required) concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement and (ii) the date\na court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n● “SEC” means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSection4.

No Right to Indemnification or Insurance\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Executive Officer against the loss of Erroneously Awarded Compensation or losses arising from any claims relating to the\nCompany’s enforcement of this Policy.

Interpretation and Amendment of this Policy\nThe Board or the Committee, in its discretion, shall have the sole authority to interpret and make any determinations regarding this Policy. Any interpretation,\ndetermination, or other action made or taken by the Committee (or, if applicable, the Board) shall be final, binding, and conclusive on all interested parties. The\ndetermination of the Committee (or, if applicable, the Board) need not be uniform with respect to one or more officers of the Company. The Board or the Committee may\namend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend the Policy to comply with any rules or standards adopted by Nasdaq or any national securities\nexchange on which the Company’s securities are then listed.\nSection 8. Filing Requirement\nThe Company shall file this Policy as an exhibit to its Annual Report on Form 10-K and make such other disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the\nrequirements of the federal securities laws, including the disclosure required by applicable SEC rules and regulations.\nSection 9. Other Recoupment Rights\nThe Company intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other\nremedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement,\nor similar agreement and any other remedies available to the Company under applicable law. Without by implication limiting the foregoing, following a restatement of the\nCompany’s financial statements, the Company also shall be entitled to recover any compensation received by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that is\nrequired to be recovered by Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n4\nSection 10. Successors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and their respective beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\n5"
