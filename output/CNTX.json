(“Context” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: CNTX), a biopharmaceutical company advancing T cell engagers for solid tumors, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and reported on recent and upcoming business highlights.\n\n“Context executed on its strategy to build a pipeline of T cell engaging bispecific antibodies through its acquisitions of CT-95, a Mesothelin x CD3 bispecific antibody, and CT-202, a Nectin-4 x CD3 bispecific antibody,” said Martin Lehr, CEO of Context. “We continue to activate additional sites for our Phase 1 trial for CTIM-76, a Claudin 6 x CD3 bispecific antibody, and expect to dose our first patient by the end of this year. We also expect to advance CT-95 into the clinic soon and expect to enroll our first patient in our CT-95 Phase 1 study in the first quarter of 2025.”\n\nMr. Lehr continued, “Additionally, the expansion of our Board of Directors is exemplary of the transformation Context has made this year. Dr. Karen Smith and Dr. Luke Walker each bring a diversified skillset and we are excited to leverage their wealth of operational experience as we navigate the next stages of growth.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Corporate Highlights**\n\n_Pipeline Updates_\n\n  * In September 2024, announced an exclusive worldwide license agreement with BioAtla, Inc. to develop and commercialize CT-202, a Nectin-4 x CD3 bispecific antibody. Context expects to file an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for CT-202 in mid-2026.\n  * In July 2024, completed the acquisition of CT-95, a potentially first-in-class Mesothelin x CD3 bispecific antibody that has received IND clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The Company believes that CT-95 is on track for dosing the first patient in the Phase 1 trial in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n_Corporate Updates_\n\n  * In November 2024, the Company will participate in the Guggenheim Global Healthcare Conference, the UBS Global Healthcare Conference, and the Stifel 2024 Healthcare Conference. A live webcast of each presentation will be available on the News and Events section of the Company’s website at <https://ir.contexttherapeutics.com/>.\n  * In November 2024, Context will present a poster titled “Determination of First In Human Dose of the T Cell-redirecting Bispecific Antibody CTIM-76 Targeting Claudin 6” at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) 39th Annual Meeting.\n  * In September 2024, announced the appointments of Dr. Karen Smith and Dr. Luke Walker to Context’s Board of Directors.\n  * In August 2024, announced the appointments of Dr. Claudio Dansky Ullmann as Chief Medical Officer and Ms. Karen Andreas as VP, Clinical Operations.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024****Financial Results**\n\n  * Cash and cash equivalents were $84.8 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $14.4 million at December 31, 2023.\n  * Research and development (“R&D”) expenses were $16.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $4.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily driven by higher in-process research and development charges of $14.75 million related to the acquisitions of CT-95 and CT-202 in the third quarter 2024. This increase was partially offset by lower CTIM-76 expense of $2.8 million, which was mainly the result of lower contract manufacturing costs and preclinical costs.\n  * General and administrative expenses were $1.9 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $1.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in professional fees for legal services incurred.\n  * Other income, net was $1.2 million for the third quarter 2024, as compared to $0.3 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent balances.\n  * Context reported a net loss of $17.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $5.9 million for the same period in 2023.\n\n\n\n**2024 Cash Guidance** The Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund the estimated duration of the dose escalation portions of its CTIM-76 and CT-95 Phase 1 trials, the estimated expenses through IND filing for CT-202, as well as its operations into 2027.\n\n**About Context Therapeutics** ®Context Therapeutics Inc.

(“BioAtla”) (Nasdaq: BCAB), a global clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of Conditionally Active Biologic (“CAB”) antibody therapeutics for the treatment of solid tumors, and Context Therapeutics Inc. (“Context”) (Nasdaq: CNTX), a biopharmaceutical company advancing T cell engaging (“TCE”) bispecific antibodies for solid tumors, today announced that the companies have entered into an agreement under which Context has obtained from BioAtla an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize BA3362, BioAtla’s Nectin-4 x CD3 TCE. Context will assume and fund all development and commercialization activities.\n\n“With the successful out-licensing of BA3362 to Context, we will continue to focus on execution of our lead clinical CAB programs, while ensuring the potential advancement of BA3362 under the leadership of a seasoned team,” said Jay M. Short, Ph.D., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of BioAtla. “We believe this transaction marks the first of multiple collaborations, including a targeted collaboration for one of our Phase 2 assets over the coming months, thereby increasing shareholder value through non-dilutive means.”\n\n“This transaction is consistent with our focus on building a pipeline of TCE assets through strategic in-licensing or acquisition,” said Martin Lehr, CEO of Context. “Nectin-4 is a priority target for Context given the target’s high prevalence in solid tumors and the unmet need to address potential resistance to Nectin-4 antibody-drug conjugates. We identified BioAtla's Nectin-4 TCE antibody as a potentially best-in-class asset. BA3362 is built from BioAtla’s compelling CAB platform technology that uses pH-dependency to drive selective Nectin-4 binding and T cell activation within the tumor microenvironment.”\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, BioAtla is eligible to receive up to $133.5 million in aggregate payments, including $15.0 million in upfront and near-term milestones with additional potential clinical, development and commercial milestones totaling $118.5 million, as well as tiered royalties on net sales.\n\nTungsten Advisors served as the exclusive financial advisor to BioAtla. Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP served as legal counsel to BioAtla. Piper Sandler served as sole financial advisor to Context. Goodwin Procter LLP served as legal counsel to Context.\n\n**About BA3362 (Nectin-4 x CD3 T cell engaging bispecific antibody**)BA3362 targets Nectin cell adhesion protein 4 (“Nectin-4”), which is highly and frequently overexpressed in a variety of cancers. Nectin-4 is a clinically-validated target for cancer therapy using a traditional antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), but it is also associated with certain adverse events, including neuropathy and rash. BA3362 is a CAB T cell engager that is designed to be preferentially active within the tumor microenvironment.\n\n**About BioAtla®** BioAtla, Inc. is a global clinical-stage biotechnology company with operations in San Diego, California, and in Beijing, China through its contractual relationship with BioDuro-Sundia, a provider of preclinical development services. Utilizing its proprietary Conditionally Active Biologics (CAB) technology, BioAtla develops novel, reversibly active monoclonal and bispecific antibodies and other protein therapeutic product candidates. CAB product candidates are designed to have more selective targeting, greater efficacy with lower toxicity, and more cost-efficient and predictable manufacturing than traditional antibodies. BioAtla has extensive and worldwide patent coverage for its CAB technology and products with greater than 765 active patent matters, more than 500 of which are issued patents. Broad patent coverage in all major markets include methods of making, screening and manufacturing CAB product candidates in a wide range of formats and composition of matter coverage for specific products. BioAtla has two first-in-class CAB programs currently in Phase 2 clinical testing, mecbotamab vedotin, a novel conditionally active AXL-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (CAB-AXL-ADC), and ozuriftamab vedotin, a novel conditionally active ROR2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (CAB-ROR2-ADC). The Phase 2 stage CAB-CTLA-4 antibody, evalstotug, is a novel CTLA-4 inhibitor designed to reduce systemic toxicity and potentially enable safer combination therapies with checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 antibody. The company’s first dual CAB bispecific T-cell engager antibody, BA3182, is currently in Phase 1 development. BA3182 targets EpCAM, which is highly and frequently expressed on many adenocarcinomas while engaging human CD3 expressing T cells. BioAtla maintains an FDA-cleared IND for its next-gen CAB-Nectin4-ADC, BA3361, the Company’s first glycoconjugate.
