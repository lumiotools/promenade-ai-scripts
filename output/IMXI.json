(NASDAQ: IMXI) (“Intermex” or the “Company”), one of the nation’s leading omnichannel money transfer services to Latin America and the Caribbean, today reported strong operating results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\nFinancial performance highlights for the third quarter of 2024 compared with the same period last year are:\n\n  * Revenues of $171.9 million, a decrease of 0.3%.\n  * Net income of $17.3 million, an increase of 16.9%.\n  * Diluted EPS of $0.53 per share, an increase of 29.3%.\n  * Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.61 per share, an increase of 19.6%.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $33.9 million, an increase of 6.9%.\n\n\n\nBob Lisy, Chairman, President, and CEO of Intermex, stated “We have delivered another strong quarter of operating results for the Company and for our shareholders. We continue to see excellent growth and profitability in our digital business, and we have leaned heavily on our DNA of efficiency to successfully navigate the retail remittance dynamic to Latin America. Net income increased by 16.9%, Adjusted EBITDA is up almost 7% from last year, and diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS were both up sharply at 29.3% and 19.6% year over year.\n\nWhile we are confident that our differentiated, omnichannel strategy, is the right path forward for the Company, the Board of Directors along with the management team firmly believe that our current market valuation does not fully capture the Company's performance, superior positive cash, intrinsic value or growth potential. We are committed to acting in the best interest of our shareholders, and to this end, we are initiating a process to assess strategic initiatives, which could include among others, a potential sale in a private transaction. The Company has retained FTP Securities LLC as its financial advisor in this process.”\n\nThere is no set timetable for the Board of Directors to review alternatives, and there can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction or other action or change in the Company’s business plans. Any potential transaction or other strategic alternative would be dependent on a number of factors that may be beyond the Company’s control. The Company does not intend to discuss or disclose further developments unless and until the Board of Directors approves a specific action or otherwise concludes the review of strategic alternatives.\n\n**_Third_** **_Quarter_** **_2024_** **_Financial_** **_Results_** **_(all_** **_comparisons_** **_are_** **_to_** **_the_** **_Third_** **_Quarter_** **_2023)_** Total revenues for the Company were $171.9 million, down 0.3% versus last year due to slowing of the overall remittance market growth to Latin America - especially in retail. Revenue was positively impacted by 76.0% growth in revenues for digitally-sent money transfers and a 5.0% increase in unique, active customers to 4.2 million. The Company's user base generated 15.2 million money transfer transactions, down 0.9% from a year ago. The total principal amount transferred for the period was$6.4 billion.\n\nNet income was $17.3 million, an increase of 16.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.53, an increase of 29.3%. The increase in Net Income was positively impacted by lower services charges from agent and banks and much lower restructuring charges, as the first phase of the La Nacional restructuring was initiated in the third quarter of 2023. Lower selling, general and administrative expenses also positively impacted net income versus 2023. Diluted earnings per share reflects the effect of higher net income and the reduction in share count as a result of the Company's stock repurchases.\n\nAdjusted net income increased 7.6% to $19.8 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.61, an increase of 19.6%. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS were impacted by the items noted above in net income, adjusted for certain items detailed in the reconciliation table below. Adjusted EPS also benefited from a lower share count as a result of the Company's stock repurchases.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 6.9% to $33.9 million, driven primarily by business operating results discussed above.\n\nAdjusted and other non-GAAP measures discussed above and elsewhere in this press release are defined below under the heading, Non-GAAP Measures.\n\n**_Year-to-Date_** **_Financial_** **_Results_** **_for_** **_2024_** **_(all_** **_comparisons_** **_are_** **_to_** **_the_** **_first_** **_nine_** **_months_** **_of_** **_2023)_** Revenues increased by 1.4% to $493.9 million. Driving that growth was a 4.5% increase in revenue from net foreign exchange gain combined with a 46.9% increase in other income primarily related to fees generated by our Company-operated stores. Principal amount from remittance activity decreased slightly by approximately 0.2% to $18.3 billion.\n\nThe Company reported net income of $43.4 million, an increase of 3.3%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.30, an increase of 14.0%, attributable to the year-to-date effects of some of the same items noted above for the third quarter of 2024.\n\nAdjusted net income totaled $52.6 million, an increase of 3.1%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.58, an increase of 13.7%, attributable to the same items noted above for the third quarter of 2024.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 4.2% to $90.3 million, attributable to the same items noted above for the third quarter of 2024 and the higher net effect of the adjusting items detailed in the reconciliation table below following the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n**_Other_** **_Items_** The Company ended the third quarter of 2024 with $156.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Net Free Cash Generated for the third quarter of 2024 was $16.9 million, slightly down from the third quarter of 2023. Year-over-year Net Free Cash Generated reflects the impact from the July acquisition of a money service entity in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Company repurchased 1,093,372 shares of its common stock for $20.3 million during the third quarter of 2024 through its underlying share repurchase program. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company purchased 2,739,499 shares for $54.9 million.\n\nIn the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred restructuring costs of approximately $2.7 million. The charges were primarily related to the Company's foreign operations and constituted reorganizing the workforce, streamlining operational processes, and integrating technology functionality. On completion, the Company expects these actions to generate over $2.0 million in recurring annualized savings starting in 2025.\n\n**_Non-GAAP_** **_Measures_** Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Net Free Cash Generated, each a Non-GAAP financial measure, are the primary metrics used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business. We present these Non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they are frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Furthermore, we believe they are helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results, because certain of such measures exclude, among other things, the effects of certain transactions that are outside the control of management, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments.\n\nAdjusted Net Income is defined as Net Income adjusted to add back certain charges and expenses, such as non-cash amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisition transactions, non-cash compensation costs, and other items outlined in the reconciliation table below, as these charges and expenses are not considered a part of our core business operations and are not an indicator of ongoing future Company performance.\n\nAdjusted Earnings per Share – Basic and Diluted is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Income by GAAP weighted-average common shares outstanding (basic and diluted).\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as Net Income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income taxes, and adjusted to add back certain charges and expenses, such as non-cash compensation costs and other items outlined in the reconciliation table below, as these charges and expenses are not considered a part of our core business operations and are not an indicator of ongoing future Company performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by Revenues.\n\nNet Free Cash Generated is defined as Net Income before provision for credit losses and depreciation and amortization adjusted to add back certain non-cash charges and expenses, such as non-cash compensation costs, and reduced by cash used in investing activities and servicing of our debt obligations.\n\nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Net Free Cash Generated are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income, net income, net income margin or earnings per share, as a measure of operating performance or cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. Non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily calculated the same way by different companies and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to U.S. GAAP.\n\nReconciliations of Net Income, the Company’s closest GAAP measure, to Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA, and Net Free Cash Generated, as well as a reconciliation of Earnings per Share to Adjusted Earnings per Share and Net Income Margin to Adjusted EBITDA Margin, are outlined in the tables below following the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n**Investor** **and** **Analyst** **Conference** **Call** **/** **Presentation** Intermex will host a conference call and webcast presentation at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time today.
