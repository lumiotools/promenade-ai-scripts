Pharmaceuticals, Inc.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alnylam.com%2F&esheet=54153925&newsitemid=20241117936734&lan=en-US&anchor=Alnylam+Pharmaceuticals%2C+Inc.&index=1&md5=90e284f93eb392b97e6d91e379b2d57d) (Nasdaq: ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics company, today announced the presentation of new results from its Phase 1 study of nucresiran (formerly ALN-TTRsc04), a next-generation RNAi therapeutic in development for the treatment of transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. The data were presented in an oral session at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2024 in Chicago. \n\nThese new results demonstrated that a single dose of nucresiran at 300 mg or higher led to rapid knockdown of serum TTR with low inter-patient variability, with mean reductions of greater than 90% from baseline achieved at Day 15 and sustained through at least Day 180. At these doses, peak reduction of mean TTR levels of greater than 96% were achieved by Day 29. Furthermore, serum TTR levels remained substantially reduced at Day 360 with a mean reduction of greater than 70% after a single 300 mg dose. Day 360 results are not yet available for the 600 mg and 900 mg dose cohorts. All doses of nucresiran have been well tolerated to date. \n\n“We are very excited by these new Phase 1 data with nucresiran, our next-generation TTR-targeting RNAi therapeutic, which demonstrated that a single dose of ≥300 mg achieved rapid knockdown of TTR greater than 90% from Day 15 that was sustained to at least six months,” said Pushkal Garg, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Alnylam. “Furthermore, we are encouraged by the potential of nucresiran to reduce interpatient variability in TTR lowering. Nucresiran utilizes our IKARIA platform, which has now demonstrated the potential to achieve durability supportive of biannual or annual dosing, representing a potential new paradigm in the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis. Importantly, nucresiran has been well tolerated at all dose levels tested to date. We look forward to sharing Phase 3 development plans in the first quarter of 2025.” \n\nThe ongoing Phase 1 dose-finding study evaluated the safety, as well as pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, of single doses of nucresiran in healthy subjects. As previously presented at Alnylam’s R&D Day in December 2023, a single dose of nucresiran led to rapid knockdown of serum TTR that was highly durable. \n\nIn subjects receiving a single 300 mg dose of nucresiran, mean serum TTR reduction of 90.3% was observed at Day 15, 96.5% at Day 29, and 92.6% at Day 180. At Day 360, mean serum TTR Reduction was 71.12%. In subjects receiving a single 600 mg dose, mean serum TTR reduction of 95.0% was observed at Day 15, 97.8% at Day 29, and 96.0% at Day 180. In subjects receiving a single 900 mg dose, mean serum TTR reduction of 91.7% was observed at Day 15, 96.7% at Day 29, and 94.2% at Day 180. As of the data cutoff date, TTR knockdown levels at Day 360 were not available for either the 600 mg or 900 mg cohort. \n\nThere has been low inter-patient variability in the TTR reduction observed; at Day 29, TTR reduction ranged from 96.0 – 96.7% in the 300 mg cohort, 96.6 – 98.6% in the 600 mg cohort, and 96.0 - 97.3% in the 900 mg cohort. \n\nIn the study, nucresiran has been well tolerated at all tested doses. The majority of adverse events across doses have been mild and none have been considered to be related to treatment. There have been no injection site reactions and no safety signals identified, including no liver-related signals. \n\n**Phase 1 Study Design**\n\nThe Phase 1 trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of nucresiran in healthy adult subjects. The study enrolled 48 healthy adult subjects randomized 3:1 to receive a single ascending dose of 5, 25, 100, 300, 600, or 900 mg of nucresiran or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study is safety and secondary endpoints include the change from baseline in serum TTR over time, as well as characterization of plasma and urine pharmacokinetics (PK) of nucresiran. \n\n**About Nucresiran**\n\nNucresiran is an investigational RNAi therapeutic in development to deliver rapid knockdown of mutant and wild-type transthyretin (TTR) and address the underlying cause of transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. As part of Alnylam’s proprietary IKARIA™ platform, nucresiran has the potential to achieve deeper and more durable rapid knockdown of TTR, allowing for less frequent dosing. The safety and efficacy of nucresiran have not been established or evaluated by the FDA, EMA or any other health authority. \n\n**About ATTR**\n\nTransthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is an underdiagnosed, rapidly progressive, debilitating and fatal disease caused by misfolded transthyretin (TTR) proteins, which accumulate as amyloid deposits in various parts of the body, including the nerves, heart and gastrointestinal tract. Patients may present with polyneuropathy, cardiomyopathy or both manifestations of disease. There are two different forms of ATTR – hereditary ATTR (hATTR), which is caused by a TTR gene variant and affects approximately 50,000 people worldwide, and wild-type ATTR (wtATTR), which occurs without a TTR gene variant and impacts an estimated 200,000-300,000 people worldwide. \n\n**About RNAi**\n\nRNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines known as RNAi therapeutics is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors that encode for disease-causing or disease pathway proteins – thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases. \n\n**About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals**\n\nAlnylam (Nasdaq: ALNY) has led the translation of RNA interference (RNAi) into a whole new class of innovative medicines with the potential to transform the lives of people afflicted with rare and prevalent diseases with unmet need.

 Alnylam Announces U.S. Food and Drug Administration Acceptance of Supplemental New Drug Application for Vutrisiran for the Treatment of ATTR Amyloidosis with Cardiomyopathy\n\nNov 25, 2024\n\n_− Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) Date Set for March 23, 2025 −_\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 25, 2024-- [Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alnylam.com%2F&esheet=54157445&newsitemid=20241125980610&lan=en-US&anchor=Alnylam+Pharmaceuticals%2C+Inc.&index=1&md5=ea232127bdcb0652a2d72b2347e1bcf9) (Nasdaq: ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the Company’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for vutrisiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic in development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). Based on the Company’s use of a Priority Review Voucher, the FDA has set an action date goal of March 23, 2025, under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). The FDA has informed the Company that it is not planning to hold an advisory committee meeting at this time to review the application. \n\nVutrisiran is the generic name for AMVUTTRA®, which is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR-PN) in adults. By rapidly knocking down both mutant and wild‑type transthyretin (TTR), vutrisiran addresses the underlying cause of transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR). If approved, vutrisiran would become the first therapeutic approved in the U.S. to treat both the polyneuropathy manifestations of hATTR and cardiomyopathy manifestations of ATTR amyloidosis. \n\n“We are pleased that the FDA has accepted our sNDA for vutrisiran for the treatment of ATTR with cardiomyopathy – a steadily progressing, debilitating and ultimately fatal disease,” said Pushkal Garg, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Alnylam. “In HELIOS-B, treatment with vutrisiran improved cardiovascular outcomes, survival, disease progression and quality of life, as compared to placebo, in a population reflective of today’s patients on substantial background treatment. We look forward to working with the FDA to support their review of the application and bring vutrisiran to patients with ATTR-CM in the U.S. early next year.” \n\nThe supplemental application to the FDA was based on positive results from HELIOS-B, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter global Phase 3 study in patients with ATTR-CM. The study demonstrated favorable effects of vutrisiran on outcomes of death and cardiovascular events, functional capacity and quality of life in patients with ATTR-CM. These treatment effects were seen on top of substantial background standard of care treatments. Vutrisiran demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability consistent with the established profile of the drug. Detailed results from the study were [presented](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.alnylam.com%2Fpress-release%3Fid%3D28411&esheet=54157445&newsitemid=20241125980610&lan=en-US&anchor=presented&index=2&md5=c9992d8898346ef074e6824db8dfea48) at the European Society of Cardiology Congress and simultaneously published in [_The New England Journal of Medicine_](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2409134&esheet=54157445&newsitemid=20241125980610&lan=en-US&anchor=The+New+England+Journal+of+Medicine&index=3&md5=cc469ceec024cc9498bbc2e10874bba9) on August 30, 2024. \n\n**AMVUTTRA ® (vutrisiran) U.S. Indication and Important Safety Information**\n\n**Indication** AMVUTTRA is indicated for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults. \n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\n**Reduced Serum Vitamin A Levels and Recommended Supplementation** AMVUTTRA treatment leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A levels. Supplementation at the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin A is advised for patients taking AMVUTTRA. Higher doses than the RDA should not be given to try to achieve normal serum vitamin A levels during treatment with AMVUTTRA, as serum vitamin A levels do not reflect the total vitamin A in the body. \n\nPatients should be referred to an ophthalmologist if they develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency (e.g., night blindness). \n\n**Adverse Reactions** The most common adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with AMVUTTRA were pain in extremity (15%), arthralgia (11%), dyspnea (7%), and vitamin A decreased (7%). \n\n**For additional information about AMVUTTRA, please see the full U.S. **[**Prescribing Information**](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alnylam.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fpdfs%2Famvuttra-us-prescribing-information.pdf&esheet=54157445&newsitemid=20241125980610&lan=en-US&anchor=Prescribing+Information&index=4&md5=23f5d2cfc263a645b64620b4dbad5803)**.**\n\n**About AMVUTTRA ® (vutrisiran) **AMVUTTRA® (vutrisiran) is an RNAi therapeutic that delivers rapid knockdown of mutant and wild-type transthyretin (TTR), addressing the underlying cause of transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. Administered quarterly via subcutaneous injection, AMVUTTRA is approved and marketed in more than 15 countries for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR-PN) in adults. Vutrisiran is also in development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), which encompasses both wild-type and hereditary forms of the disease.

Patients may present with polyneuropathy, cardiomyopathy, or both manifestations of disease. There are two different forms of ATTR – hereditary ATTR (hATTR), which is caused by a TTR gene variant and affects approximately 50,000 people worldwide, and wild-type ATTR (wtATTR), which occurs without a TTR gene variant and impacts an estimated 200,000 – 300,000 people worldwide. \n\n**About RNAi** RNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as “a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,” and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines known as RNAi therapeutics is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today’s medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) – the genetic precursors that encode for disease-causing or disease pathway proteins – thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases. \n\n**About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals **Alnylam (Nasdaq: ALNY) has led the translation of RNA interference (RNAi) into a whole new class of innovative medicines with the potential to transform the lives of people afflicted with rare and prevalent diseases with unmet need.

RNAi is a naturally occurring\nbiological pathway within cells for sequence-specific silencing and regulation of gene expression. By harnessing the RNAi\npathway, we have developed a new class of innovative medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics. RNAi therapeutics are\ncomprised of small interfering RNA, or siRNA, that function upstream of conventional medicines by potently silencing\nmessengerRNA,ormRNA,thatencodeforproteinsimplicatedinthecauseorpathwayofdisease,thuspreventingthemfrom\nbeing made. We believe this is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with rare and\nprevalent diseases. To date, our efforts to advance this revolutionary approach have yielded the approval of five first-in-class\nRNAi-based medicines, ONPATTRO® (patisiran), AMVUTTRA® (vutrisiran), GIVLAARI® (givosiran), OXLUMO®\n(lumasiran)andLeqvio®(inclisiran).\nOur research and development strategy is to target genetically validated genes that have been implicated in the cause or\npathway of human disease. We utilize a N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) conjugate approach or lipid nanoparticle (LNP) to\nenable hepatic delivery of siRNAs. For delivery to the central nervous system, or CNS, and the eye (ocular delivery), we are\nutilizing an alternative conjugate approach based on a hexadecyl (C16) moiety as a lipophilic ligand. During 2023, we\ncontinued to advance approaches for heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue delivery of siRNAs. Our focus is on clinical\nindications where there is a high unmet need, a genetically validated target, early biomarkers for the assessment of clinical\nactivity in Phase 1 clinical studies, and a definable path for drug development, regulatory approval, patient access and\ncommercialization.\nIn early 2021, we launched our Alnylam P5x25 strategy, which focuses on our planned transition to a top-tier biotech\ncompanybytheendof2025.WithAlnylamP5x25,weaimtodelivertransformativerare,specialtyandselectprevalentdisease\nmedicines for patients around the world through sustainable innovation, while delivering exceptional financial performance.\nSpecifically,weintendtoend2025withthefollowingprofile:\nPatients:Over0.5milliononourRNAitherapeuticsglobally\nProducts:Sixormoremarketedproductsinrareandprevalentdiseases\nPipeline:Over20clinicalprograms,with10ormoreinlatestagesandfourormoreINDsperyear\nPerformance:≥40%revenueCAGR(compoundannualgrowthrate)throughYE2025\nProfitability: Achieve sustainable non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) profitability within\ntheperiod\nWeended2023makingconsiderableprogressonthesegoals,andcurrentlyhavefivemarketedproductsandmorethanten\nclinicalprograms,includingseveralinlate-stagedevelopment,acrossrare,specialtyandselectprevalentindications.\nONPATTROisapprovedbytheUnitedStatesFoodandDrugAdministration,ortheFDA,forthetreatmentofhereditary\ntransthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis, with polyneuropathy in adults and has also been approved in the\nEuropean Union, or EU, for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy, in\nJapan for the treatment of transthyretin, or TTR, type familial amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, and in multiple additional\ncountries, including Brazil. In August 2022, we reported positive results from the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study of patisiran (the\nnon-branded name of ONPATTRO) in patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, and in December 2022, we\nsubmitted a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, to the FDA for patisiran as a potential treatment for the ATTR\namyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. On September 13, 2023, the FDA’s Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee,\nor CRDAC, voted 9:3 that patisiran’s benefits outweigh its risks for the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR\namyloidosis, with cardiomyopathy. Nevertheless, on October 6, 2023, the FDA issued a complete response letter, or CRL,\nindicating that evidence of clinical meaningfulness of patisiran was not established for ATTR amyloidosis with\ncardiomyopathy,andthereforethesNDAforpatisirancouldnotbeapprovedinitspresentform.TheCRLdidnotidentifyany\nissues with respect to clinical safety, study conduct, drug quality or manufacturing. Patisiran remains under regulatory review\nwith the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) for ONPATTRO for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis with\ncardiomyopathy.\nAMVUTTRA is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy in adults, in the EU\nand the United Kingdom, or UK, for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2\npolyneuropathy,inJapanforthetreatmentofTTRtypefamilialamyloidosiswithpolyneuropathy,andinadditionalcountries,\nincludingBrazil,Argentina,SwitzerlandandCanada.Regulatoryfilingscontinueinotherterritorieswithsubmissionscurrently\nunderrevieworplannedfor2024andbeyond.\nGIVLAARI is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with acute hepatic porphyria, or AHP, in the EU for the\ntreatment of AHP in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, and in several additional countries, including Brazil,\n5\nCanada, Australia, Switzerland and Japan.

In addition to Leqvio, we are advancing zilebesiran, an investigational,\nsubcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting angiotensinogen, or AGT, in development for the treatment of\nhypertension. In November 2021, we reported positive interim data from the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of zilebesiran, and\ninitiated the KARDIA Phase 2 clinical trials for zilebesiran. KARDIA-1 is designed to evaluate zilebesiran as a monotherapy\nacross different doses administered quarterly and biannually. KARDIA-2 is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of\nzilebesiranadministeredbiannuallyasaconcomitanttherapyinpatientswhosebloodpressureisnotadequatelycontrolledbya\nstandard of care antihypertensive medication. In September 2023, we reported positive topline results from KARDIA-1. We\nanticipate reporting topline results from KARDIA-2 in early 2024. In July 2023, we entered into a Collaboration and License\nAgreement, or the Roche Collaboration and License Agreement, with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Genentech, Inc. or,\ncollectively, Roche, pursuant to which we established a worldwide, strategic collaboration for the joint development and\ncommercialization of zilebesiran.

We believe this success will enable us to\nachieve our Alnylam P5x25 strategy under which we expect to sustainably and organically create and commercialize\ntransformative rare, specialty and select prevalent disease medicines benefiting patients around the world while delivering\nstrongfinancialperformance,resultinginaleadingbiotechprofilebytheendof2025.\nEarly efforts focused on delivery of RNAi therapeutics utilizing LNPs, where siRNA molecules are encapsulated in\nspecific lipid-based formulations. This technology enables systemic delivery with intravenous drug administration and is\nassociated with potent, rapid and durable target gene silencing and an encouraging tolerability profile in clinical studies\nconductedtodate,aswellasinourcommercialexperience.Ourfirstcommercialproduct,ONPATTRO,isformulatedutilizing\nLNPs.\nIn parallel, we have advanced proprietary technology that conjugates a sugar molecule called GalNAc to the siRNA\nmolecule. This simpler delivery approach enables more convenient, subcutaneous administration of our drug candidates\ndirected to liver expressed target genes, a key aspect of our platform. Results from our Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry, or\nESC, GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform have demonstrated a durability of effect that we believe, based on our clinical\nresults, supports once-monthly, once-quarterly, and potentially, bi-annual subcutaneous dose regimens. Due to this increased\npotencyanddurability,aswellasawidetherapeuticindex,thisconjugateplatformhasbecomeourprimaryapproachfordrug\ndevelopmentandisleveragedand,webelieve,stronglyvalidatedby,AMVUTTRA,GIVLAARI,OXLUMO,andLeqvio,our\nmorerecently approved medicines.

C16 conjugates provide\n9\nrobust CNS knockdown with wide biodistribution and long duration of action, and this technology enabled our landmark\ncollaborationwithRegeneronfortheadvancementofRNAitherapeuticsforabroadrangeofdiseasesbyaddressingtherapeutic\ntargets in the eye and CNS, in addition to a select number of targets in the liver. We are continuing to advance other\nextrahepatic delivery approaches, including delivery to muscle and adipose cells.

This\nPhase 3 program represents the largest clinical program conducted to date for an investigational RNAi therapeutic program.\nMostrecently,inAugust2023,NovartisannouncedresultsfromitsPhase3open-labelextensionORION-8trial,whichshowed\nthat twice-yearly (after an initial dose and another at three months) Leqvio, in addition to statin therapy, provides consistent\nLDL-CreductionbeyondsixyearsinpatientswithASCVD,increasedriskofASCVDorHeFH.\n15\nMultiple additional Phase 3 trials are currently ongoing, including cardiovascular outcomes trials, ORION-4 and the\nNovartisinitiatedVICTORION-2-PREVENT.\nAdditionalLate-StageClinicalDevelopmentPrograms\nFitusiran—Hemophilia\nFitusiran is an investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting antithrombin, or AT, for the\ntreatment of hemophilia A and B, with and without inhibitors, that is being advanced by our collaborator, Sanofi. Fitusiran is\ndesigned to lower levels of AT with the goal of promoting sufficient thrombin generation to prevent bleeding. AT acts by\ninactivatingthrombinandothercoagulationfactors,andplaysakeyroleinnormalhemostasisbyhelpingtolimittheprocessof\nfibrinclotformation.\nHemophiliaisahereditarybleedingdisordercharacterizedbyanunderlyingdefectintheabilitytogenerateadequatelevels\nof thrombin needed for effective fibrin clot formation, thereby resulting in recurrent bleeds into joints, muscles, and major\ninternalorgans.LoweringATinthehemophiliasettingmaypromotethegenerationofsufficientlevelsofthrombinneededto\nform an effective fibrin clot and prevent bleeding. This rationale is supported by human genetic data suggesting that co-\ninheritance of thrombophilic mutations, including AT deficiency, may ameliorate bleeding in hemophilia. We believe this\napproachisauniqueandinnovativestrategyforpreventingbleedinginpeoplewithhemophilia.\nThere are approximately 200,000 people living with hemophilia A and hemophilia B worldwide. Standard treatment for\npeople with hemophilia currently involves replacement of the deficient clotting factor either as prophylaxis or on-demand\ntherapy, which can lead to a temporary restoration of thrombin generation capacity. However, with current factor replacement\ntreatmentspeoplewithhemophiliaareatriskofdevelopingneutralizingantibodies,orinhibitors,totheirreplacementfactor,a\nvery serious complication affecting as many as one third of people with severe hemophilia A and a smaller fraction of people\nwithhemophiliaB.Peoplewhodevelopinhibitorsbecomerefractorytoreplacementfactortherapyandaretwiceaslikelytobe\nhospitalizedforableedingepisode.\nFitusiraniscurrentlybeingevaluatedintheATLASPhase3program.SanofipresentedpositiveresultsfromtheATLAS-\nA/BandATLAS-INHPhase3studiesoffitusiraninDecember2021,andinJuly2022,Sanofipresentedpositiveresultsfrom\nthePhase3ATLAS-PPXstudyevaluatingtheefficacyandsafetyofonce-monthlyfitusiran(80mg)inadultsandadolescents\nwith severe hemophilia A or B who were previously treated with prior factor or bypassing agent prophylaxis.

Sanofi expects to\nsubmit an NDA for fitusiran to the FDA in 2024. Fitusiran has received both U.S. and EU Orphan Drug Designations for the\ntreatmentofhemophiliaAandB.\nIn January 2018, we and Sanofi entered into an amendment to our 2014 collaboration, as well as the ALN-AT3 Global\nLicense Terms, which as further amended in April 2019 are referred to as the A&R AT3 License Terms, pursuant to which\nSanofi has global rights to develop and commercialize fitusiran and any back-up products. The 2014 Sanofi collaboration, as\namended, as well as the A&R AT3 License Terms, are described below under the heading “Our Collaboration and Licensing\nStrategy.”\nCemdisiran—Complement-MediatedDiseases\nCemdisiran is a subcutaneously administered, investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting the C5 component of the\ncomplement pathway in development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases. The complement system plays a\ncentral role in immunity as a protective mechanism for host defense, but its dysregulation results in a broad range of human\ndiseases including immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or IgAN, myasthenia gravis, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria,\namongstothers.\nIn June 2022, we announced positive topline results from the Phase 2 study of cemdisiran as a monotherapy in adult\npatients with IgAN. In November 2022, Regeneron exercised its right to opt-out of the cemdisiran monotherapy program.\nCemdisiran is currently Phase 3 ready as a monotherapy for IgAN, and we are evaluating options for further development.\nCemdisiran is also being evaluated by our collaborator, Regeneron, in combination with Regeneron’s anti-C5 monoclonal\nantibody,pozelimab,inPhase3studiesinmyastheniagravisandparoxysmalnocturnalhemoglobinuria.Regeneron’sdecision\nto opt-out of the monotherapy program has no impact on Regeneron’s ongoing efforts under a separate license agreement to\ndevelopcemdisiranincombinationwithpozelimab.\nEarly-StageClinicalDevelopmentPrograms\nZilebesiran(formerlyALN-AGT)—Hypertension\nZilebesiran is an investigational, subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic targeting AGT, in development for the\ntreatment of hypertension in high unmet need populations.

The 2015 Ionis agreement provides for certain new exclusive target cross-licenses of intellectual property on eight\ndisease targets, providing each company with exclusive RNA therapeutic license rights for four programs, and extended the\nparties’ existing non-exclusive technology cross-license, which was originally entered into in 2004 and was amended and\nrestated in 2009, through April 2019. Pursuant to the 2015 Ionis agreement, Ionis granted to us an exclusive, low single-digit\nroyalty-bearing license to its chemistry, motif, mechanism and target-specific intellectual property for oligonucleotide\ntherapeutics against four targets. In exchange, we granted to Ionis an exclusive, low single-digit royalty-bearing license to our\nchemistry, motif, mechanism and target-specific intellectual property for oligonucleotide therapeutics against four targets.\nUnder the original agreement, Ionis licensed to us its patent estate related to antisense motifs and mechanisms and\noligonucleotide chemistry for double-stranded RNAi products in exchange for a previously disclosed technology access fee,\nparticipation in fees for our collaboration programs and future milestone and royalty payments from us for programs that\nincorporateIonis’intellectualproperty.WehavetherighttouseIonis’intellectualpropertyinourdevelopmentprogramsorin\ncollaborations and Ionis agreed not to grant licenses under these patents to any other organization for the discovery,\ndevelopmentandcommercializationofdouble-strandedRNAproductsdesignedtoworkthroughanRNAimechanism,except\nin the context of a collaboration in which Ionis plays an active role.

We believe that these approved products and, if\napproved, product candidates, could compete with fitusiran, assuming it receives regulatory approval for the treatment of\nhemophilia.\nOtherCompetition\nFinally, for diseases that we are targeting with our product candidates in early-stage clinical development, pre-clinical\ndevelopment and discovery programs, including alpha-1 liver disease, hepatitis B, hypertension, Alzheimer’s disease, CAA,\nNASH, and type 2 diabetes, there are drugs currently on the market or in various stages of clinical development.\nNotwithstanding the availability of these products and product candidates, we believe there remains sufficient unmet medical\nneedtowarranttheadvancementofourinvestigationalRNAitherapeuticprograms.\n26\nRegulatoryMatters\nU.S.RegulatoryConsiderations\nThe research, testing, manufacture and marketing of drug products and their delivery systems are extensively regulated in\nthe U.S. and the rest of the world. In the U.S., drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug,\nand Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research,\ndevelopment, testing, approval, manufacture, storage, record keeping, reporting, labeling, marketing and distribution of drug\nproducts.Failuretocomplywiththeapplicableregulatoryrequirementsmaysubjectacompanytoavarietyofadministrativeor\njudicially-imposed sanctions and the inability to obtain or maintain required approvals to test or market drug products. These\nsanctions could include, among other things, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of\nproductionordistribution,clinicalholds,injunctions,fines,civilpenaltiesorcriminalprosecution.\nThe steps ordinarily required before a new drug product may be marketed in the U.S. include nonclinical laboratory tests,\nanimal tests and formulation studies, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective prior to\ncommencementofclinicaltestingintheU.S.,approvalbyaninstitutionalreviewboard,orIRB,ateachclinicalsitebeforeeach\ntrial may be initiated, completion of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish that the drug product is safe and\neffective for the indication and other conditions of use for which FDA approval is sought, submission to the FDA of an NDA\n(orsupplementalNDAforapprovedproducts),acceptanceoftheNDAforreviewbytheFDA,andFDAreviewandapproval\nof the NDA. Satisfaction of the FDA’s pre-market approval requirements typically takes several years, but may vary\nsubstantially depending upon the complexity of the product and the nature of the disease. Government regulation may delay,\nlimit or prevent marketing of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on a\ncompany’sactivities.Successinearly-stageclinicaltrialsdoesnotnecessarilyassuresuccessinlater-stageclinicaltrials.Data\nobtainedfromclinicalactivities,includingbutnotlimitedtothedataderivedfromourclinicaltrialsforproductcandidates,are\nnot always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or even prevent regulatory\napproval. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product,\nincludingnewsafetyrisksfromcommercialuse,clinicalornonclinicaldataormanufacturingissues,mayresultinrestrictions\nontheproductorevencompletewithdrawaloftheproductfromthemarket.\nNonclinicalTestsandClinicalTrials\nNonclinicaltestsincludelaboratoryevaluationofproductchemistryandformulation,aswellasanimaltestingtoassessthe\npotential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests and formulation of compounds for\ntesting must comply with applicable federal regulations and requirements, including in some cases the FDA’s good laboratory\npractice requirements and the Animal Welfare Act. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an\nIND, together with chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, information, analytical and stability data, a proposed\nclinicaltrialprotocolandotherinformation.ClinicaltestinginhumansmaynotcommenceuntilanINDisineffect.\nAn IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the sponsor that the proposed\ninvestigation(s) are subject to a clinical hold. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, or partial clinical hold, the FDA’s concerns\nmust be resolved prior to the commencement of clinical trials, or the FDA can enforce other changes to the clinical\ndevelopment program or clinical trial(s). The IND review process can result in substantial delay and expense. We, an IRB, or\ntheFDAmay,atanytime,suspend,terminate,significantlymodify,restrictorimposeaclinicalholdonongoingclinicaltrials.\nIf the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization, and then the\nclinicaltrialscancommenceorrecommenceonlyunderthetermsauthorizedbytheFDA.\nClinical trials involve the administration of an investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the\nsupervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the\nobjectives of the trial and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on human\nsubjects in the U.S. must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted in\ncompliance with federal regulations and requirements, commonly referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, to assure data\nintegrity and protect the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants. Among other things, GCP requires that all research\nsubjectsprovidetheirinformedconsentpriortoparticipatinginanyclinicalstudy,andthataproperlyconstitutedIRBforeach\ninstitution participating in the clinical trial review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that\ninstitutionandconductcontinuingreviewthroughoutthetrial.TheIRBmustreviewandapprove,amongotherthings,thestudy\nprotocolandinformedconsentinformationtobeprovidedtostudysubjects.\nClinicaltrialstosupportNDAsaretypicallyconductedinthreesequentialphases,whichmayoverlaporbecombined.\n• In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested primarily to\nassess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions and metabolism associated with increasing\ndoses.\n• Phase2usuallyinvolvestrialsinalimitedpatientpopulation,toassesstheoptimumdosageanddoseregimen,identify\npossibleadverseeffectsandsafetyrisks,andprovidepreliminarysupportfortheefficacyofthedrugintheindication\nbeingstudied.\n27\n• Phase 3 clinical trials further evaluate the drug’s clinical efficacy, side effects and safety in an expanded patient\npopulation, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of\nthedrugandtoprovideadequateinformationforthelabelingofthedrug.\nPhase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing of any drug candidates may not be completed successfully within any specified time\nperiod, if at all. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the\nU.S.TheFDAmay,atitsdiscretion,re-evaluate,alter,suspendorterminatethetestingbaseduponthedataaccumulatedtothat\npoint and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the subject participating in the study. An IRB or a clinical trial\nsponsor may also modify, suspend or terminate clinical trials, or parts of clinical trials, at any time for various reasons,\nincludingafindingthatthesubjectsorpatientsarebeingexposedtoanunacceptablehealthrisk.TheFDAcanalsorequestor\nrequire that additional clinical trials, nonclinical evaluations or changes in the manufacturing process be conducted as a\ncondition to product approval. Finally, sponsors are required to publicly disseminate information about certain ongoing and\ncompletedclinicaltrialsonClinicalTrials.gov,agovernmentwebsiteadministeredbytheNationalInstitutesofHealth,orNIH.\nNewDrugApplications\nWe believe that any RNAi product candidate we develop, whether for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis, AHP, PH1,\nhypercholesterolemiaorthevariousindicationstargetedinourclinicaldevelopmentornonclinicaldiscoveryprograms,willbe\nregulatedbytheFDAasanewdrugthatisnotconsideredtobeabiologic,andthuswillrequireanNDAratherthanabiologics\nlicense agreement, or BLA. FDA approval of an NDA is required before commercial distribution of a new drug may begin in\ntheU.S.AnNDAmustincludetheresultsofextensivenonclinical,clinicalandothertesting,asdescribedabove,acompilation\nof data relating to the product’s pharmacology, CMC information, proposed labeling and other information. In addition, an\nNDA for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration\ntypically must contain data assessing the safety and effectiveness for the claimed indication in all relevant pediatric\nsubpopulations,althoughdeferralsorfullorpartialwaiversmaybeavailableinsomecircumstances.\nThe cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under the PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be\naccompanied by an application fee. For fiscal year 2024, the application fee for each NDA requiring clinical data is\napproximately $4.0 million. The PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each approved prescription drug product,\nwhichhasbeensetatapproximately$417,000forfiscalyear2024.TheFDAadjuststhePDUFAuserfeesonanannualbasis.\nFeewaivers,reductionsandexceptionsareavailableincertaincircumstances.Additionally,noapplicationfeesareassessedon\nNDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the NDA also includes a non-orphan indication. The FDA conducts a\npreliminaryreviewofallNDAswithinthefirst60daysaftersubmissionbeforeacceptingthemforfilingtodeterminewhether\nthey are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. During that time, the FDA may request additional information\nbeforedecidingwhethertoacceptanNDAforfiling.IftheFDAdeterminesthatanNDAisnotsufficientlycompletetopermit\nsubstantive review, it will issue a refuse to file determination and the NDA will not be substantively reviewed by the FDA. If\nthe submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. The FDA has agreed to specified\nperformance goals regarding the timing of the completion of its review of NDAs, although the goals are not binding and the\nFDAdoesnotalwaysmeetthesegoals.ThereviewprocessisoftensignificantlyextendedbytheFDA’srequestsforadditional\ninformation or clarification regarding information provided in the submission.

The approved\nindication may be narrower than what was proposed by the applicant or for a narrower patient population than the population\nstudiedinclinicaltrials.AsaconditionofNDAapproval,theFDAmayrequirepost-approvalevaluations,sometimesreferred\nto as Phase 4 trials, or other surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or effectiveness and may impose other conditions,\nincludinglabelingrestrictions,suchasaBoxedWarning,and/ordistributionanduserestrictionsthroughaRiskEvaluationand\nMitigation Strategy, or REMS, all of which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Once\ngranted,productapprovalsmaybefurtherlimitedorwithdrawnifcompliancewithregulatoryrequirementsisnotmaintainedor\nsafetyorotherproblemsareidentifiedfollowinginitialmarketing.\nPost-ApprovalRegulation\nOnce an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements, including requirements for\nmanufacturingestablishmentregistrationandproductlisting,adverseeventreporting,submissionofotherperiodicreports,field\n28\nalerts, recordkeeping, product sampling and distribution. Additionally, the FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that\nmay be made about prescription drug products and biologics. In particular, the FDA generally prohibits pharmaceutical\ncompanies from promoting their drugs or biologics for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product’s\napproved labeling, and requires that important safety information be presented to balance information provided on a drug’s\neffectiveness. In addition, the FDA requires substantiation of any safety or effectiveness claims, including claims that one\nproductissuperiorintermsofsafetyoreffectivenesstoanotherproduct.Totheextentthatmarketacceptanceofourproducts\ndepends on their superiority over existing therapies, any restriction on our ability to advertise or otherwise promote claims of\nsuperiority, or requirements to conduct additional expensive clinical trials to provide proof of such claims, could negatively\naffect the sales of our products or our costs.

The FDA generally reserves the use of accelerated approvals for situations in\nwhich the product candidate at issue provides a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. Products granted\naccelerated approval are subject to certain post-marketing requirements, which typically include a requirement to conduct one\normorepost-approvalstudiestoconfirmtheclinicalbenefitoftheproduct,whichmustbecompletedwithduediligence.Under\nthe Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such\ntrialsbeunderwaypriortoapprovalorwithinaspecifictimeperiodafterthedateofapprovalforaproductgrantedaccelerated\napproval. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or\nindication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical\nbenefit of the product or the sponsor disseminates false or misleading promotional materials relating to the relevant product.\nFDORAalsoaddedthefailuretoconductpost-approvalstudieswithduediligenceortosubmittimelyprogressreportsonsuch\nstudies to the list of prohibited acts under the FD&C Act, which means that any such failures, whether they result from our\nactions or the actions of third parties, could provide the basis for enforcement actions to be brought against us, which may be\ncostly to defend or we may be unsuccessful in our defense.

The negotiated prices will be capped at a statutorily determined ceiling price.

President Biden also signed an executive order on\nJuly 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to, among other things, support legislative reforms that would lower the\nprices of prescription drugs, including by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and\nbiosimilars,andsupporttheenactmentofapublichealthinsuranceoption.Amongotherthings,theexecutiveorderdirectsthe\nU.S.DepartmentofHealthandHumanServices,orHHSSecretary,toprovideareportonactionstocombatexcessivepricing\nof prescription drugs, continue to clarify and improve the approval framework for generic drugs and identify and address any\nefforts to impede generic drug competition, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the federal\ngovernment pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry. The executive order also directs the FDA to work with\nstates and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare\nPrescriptionDrug,Improvement,andModernizationActof2003,andtheFDA’simplementingregulations.TheFDAreleased\nsuchimplementingregulationsonSeptember24,2020,whichwentintoeffectonNovember30,2020,providingguidancefor\nstates to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada.

On September 29, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of\nColumbia set aside the 2020 regulation. It is possible that changes in insurer policies regarding co-pay coupons and patient\nassistance programs and/or the introduction and enactment of new legislation or regulatory action could restrict or otherwise\nnegatively affect these co-pay coupon programs and patient support programs, which could result in fewer patients using\naffected products, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on pharmaceutical manufacturers’ sales, business, and\nfinancialcondition.\nAt the state level, governments have and continue to consider legislation and regulations designed to control\npharmaceutical product pricing. Some of these measures include restricting price, reimbursement, discounts, product access,\n34\nandmarketing;imposingdrugprice,cost,andmarketingdisclosureandtransparencyrequirements;permittingimportationfrom\nothercountries;andencouragingbulkpurchasing.\nHealthcareFraudandAbuse\nFederalandstatelawsgenerallyprohibitthepaymentorreceiptofkickbacks,bribesorotherremunerationinexchangefor\nthe referral of patients or other healthcare-related business. For example, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits anyone\nfrom, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any bribe, kickback or other\nremuneration intended to induce the referral of patients for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, healthcare products\nandservicesreimbursedbyafederalhealthcareprogram,includingMedicareandMedicaid.Violationsofthisfederallawcan\nresult in significant penalties, including imprisonment, monetary fines and assessments, and exclusion from Medicare,\nMedicaid and other federal healthcare programs.

Some suits filed under the\nFCA, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by a “whistleblower” or “relator” on behalf of the government, and such\nindividuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Manufacturers can be held\nliable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, where they are found to have caused\nsubmission of false claims by, among other things, providing incorrect coding or billing advice about their products to\ncustomers that file claims, or by engaging in kickback arrangements or off-label promotion with customers that file claims. In\naddition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal\nAnti-KickbackStatuteconstitutesafalseorfraudulentclaimforpurposesoftheFCA.Anumberofstatesalsohavefalseclaims\nlaws, and some of these laws may apply to claims for items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and/or commercial\ninsurance.Sanctionsunderthesefederalandstatefraudandabuselawsmayincludecivilmonetarypenaltiesandcriminalfines,\nexclusionfromgovernmenthealthcareprogramsandimprisonment.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S.\njurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their officers, directors, employees and intermediaries from offering or making\nimproperpaymentstonon-U.S.officialsforthepurposeofobtainingorretainingbusiness.ViolationoftheFCPAcouldresult\ninsubstantialcivilandcriminalpenaltiesandremedies,includingfines,disgorgement,andimprisonment.\nThe federal Sunshine Act requires manufacturers to report certain payments to healthcare providers to CMS.

At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of\nscientific advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the CHMP. A fee is incurred with each scientific\nadvice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (CMC\ntesting), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not\nlegallybindingwithregardtoanyfutureMAAoftheproductconcerned.\nMarketingAuthorisations\nAfter completion of the required clinical testing, we must obtain a marketing authorisation before we may place a\nmedicinal product on the market in the EU. There are various application procedures available, depending on the type of\nproductinvolved.Allapplicationproceduresrequireanapplicationinthecommontechnicaldocumentformat,whichincludes\nthe submission of detailed information about the manufacturing and quality of the product, and nonclinical study and clinical\ntrial information. There is an increasing trend in the EU towards greater transparency and, while the manufacturing or quality\ninformation is currently generally protected as confidential information, the EMA and national regulatory authorities are now\nliabletodisclosemuchofthenonclinicalandclinicalinformationinmarketingauthorisationdossiers,includingthefullclinical\nstudyreports,inresponsetofreedomofinformationrequestsafterthemarketingauthorisationhasbeengranted.AsofOctober\n2016, the EMA began publishing clinical data (including clinical study reports) on the agency’s website following the grant,\ndenial or withdrawal of an MAA for a centralised marketing authorisation, subject to procedures for limited redactions and\nprotectionagainstunfaircommercialuse.\nThe centralized procedure gives rise to marketing authorisations that are valid throughout the EU and, by extension (after\nnationalimplementingdecisions),inNorway,IcelandandLiechtenstein,which,togetherwiththeEUmemberstates,comprise\nthe European Economic Area, or EEA. Applicants file MAAs with the EMA, where they are reviewed by relevant scientific\ncommittees, including the CHMP. The EMA forwards CHMP opinions to the EC, which uses them as the basis for deciding\nwhethertograntamarketingauthorisation.Thecentralizedprocedureiscompulsoryformedicinalproductsthat(1)arederived\nfrom biotechnology processes, (2) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/\nAIDS,cancer,diabetes,neurodegenerativedisorders,viraldiseasesorautoimmunediseasesandotherimmunedysfunctions,(3)\nare orphan medicinal products or (4) are advanced therapy medicinal products, such as gene or cell therapy medicines. For\n36\nmedicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant may voluntarily submit an application for a centralized\nmarketing authorisation to the EMA, as long as the CHMP agrees that (i) the medicine concerned contains a new active\nsubstance, (ii) the medicine is a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation, or (iii) the authorisation of the\nmedicineunderthecentralizedprocedurewouldbeintheinterestofpublichealth.\nForthosemedicinalproductsforwhichthecentralizedprocedureisnotavailable,theapplicantmustsubmitMAAstothe\nnational medicines regulators through one of three procedures: (1) a national procedure, which results in a marketing\nauthorisationinasingleEUmemberstate;(2)thedecentralizedprocedure,inwhichapplicationsaresubmittedsimultaneously\nin two or more EU member states; and (3) the mutual recognition procedure, which must be used if the product has already\nbeenauthorisedinatleastoneotherEUmemberstate,andinwhichtheEUmemberstatesarerequiredtograntanauthorisation\nrecognizing the existing authorisation in the other EU member state, unless they identify a serious risk to public health.

The EMA granted an accelerated assessment for patisiran, which was approved in the\nEUinAugust2018underthecentralizedprocedure.\nDataExclusivity\nMAAs for generic medicinal products do not need to include the results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, but\ninsteadcanrefertothedataincludedinthemarketingauthorisationofareferenceproductforwhichregulatorydataexclusivity\nhas expired. If a marketing authorisation is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product\nbenefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic MAAs referring to the data of that product will not be\naccepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may\nnot be placed on the market. The two-year market exclusivity period may be extended to three years if during the first eight\nyears of the product’s authorisation, a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is\napproved.\nThereisaspecialregimeforbiosimilars,orbiologicalmedicinalproductsthataresimilartoareferencemedicinalproduct\nbut that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or\nmanufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate pre-clinical studies or clinical trials must be provided,\nand guidelines from the EMA detail the type of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product.\nThere are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is\nunlikelythatbiosimilarsofthoseproductswillcurrentlybeapprovedintheEU.However,guidancefromtheEMAstatesthat\ntheywillbeconsideredinthefutureinlightofthescientificknowledgeandregulatoryexperiencegainedatthetime.\nOrphanMedicinalProducts\nTheEMA’sCommitteeforOrphanMedicinalProducts,orCOMP,mayrecommendorphanmedicinalproductdesignation\nto promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or\nchronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU. Additionally, designation is\ngranted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious\nand chronic condition when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the product in the EU would be sufficient to justify\nthe necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. The COMP may only recommend orphan medicinal product\ndesignation when the product in question offers a significant clinical benefit over existing approved products for the relevant\nindicationorwherenosatisfactorymethodofdiagnosis,preventionortreatmentofsuchconditionexists.Followingapositive\nopinionbytheCOMP,theECadoptsadecisiongrantingorphanstatus.TheCOMPwillreassessorphanstatusinparallelwith\nEMA review of an MAA and orphan status may be withdrawn at that stage if it no longer fulfills the orphan criteria (for\ninstance because in the meantime a new product was approved for the indication and no convincing data are available to\ndemonstrate a significant benefit over that product). Orphan medicinal product designation entitles a party to financial\nincentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing\nauthorisation. During this period, the competent authorities may not accept or approve any similar medicinal product for the\nsame therapeutic indication, unless (i) the second medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to\nthe authorised orphan product; (ii) the marketing authorisation holder for the authorised product consents to a second orphan\nmedicinal product application; or (iii) the marketing authorisation holder for the authorised product cannot supply enough\norphan medicinal product. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan medicinal product designation criteria are no\nlonger met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of orphan\ndesignation.Patisiran,approvedintheEUinAugust2018,givosiran,approvedintheEUinMarch2020,lumasiran,approved\n37\nin the EU in November 2020, as well as vutrisiran, approved in the EU in September 2022 and fitusiran have been granted\norphanmedicinalproductdesignation.\nPost-ApprovalControls\nTheholderofamarketingauthorisationmustestablishandmaintainapharmacovigilancesystemandappointanindividual\nqualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system.

Meanwhile, the Research Ethics Committees, or CEPs, are regional\nbodies responsible for low and medium complexity research protocols and are the gateway to all research projects involving\nhuman subjects in the country. Clinical trials on humans must be approved by the CEP/CONEP system. Depending on the\nsubject matter, clinical research must be approved by both bodies. Under certain circumstances, the clinical trial must also be\napproved by the National Health Surveillance Agency, or ANVISA, particularly when the research is intended to support the\napprovalofanewpharmaceuticalproductorthemodificationofanexistingmarketingauthorization.\nBrazilian regulations governing clinical research are quite protective of the participating subject, so the sponsor must\nprovidebroadandcomprehensiveprotectiontotheparticipant,ensuringcompensationtoanysubjectinjuredintheclinicaltrial.\nUnder certain circumstances, at the end of the clinical trial, the sponsor may also be required to provide participants with free\nandunlimitedaccesstothebestprophylactic,diagnosticandtherapeuticmethodsthathaveproveneffectiveduringthetrial.In\nthecaseoftrialsinvolvingpatientsdiagnosedwithultra-rarediseases,theregulationcurrentlylimitsthepost-trialdrugsupply\nto five years after the drug is approved by ANVISA.

The time required may differ from that required for FDA approval and may be longer than that required to\nobtain FDA approval. Thus, there can be substantial delays in obtaining required marketing approvals from foreign regulatory\nauthorities after the relevant applications are filed. Additionally, foreign governments lately are encouraging manufacturers to\nsubmitmarketingapplicationsintheirjurisdictionswithavarietyofincentivesincludingfavorablereimbursementratemaking.\nIn Canada, while Health Canada has developed service standards for regulatory review time, those are target or estimated\ntimelines that we can reasonably expect to receive from the regulator under normal circumstances, and as such, there may be\ndelaysincertainsituations.InBrazil,obtainingtheapprovaltobeginhumanclinicaltrialscantakefrom180to360days,and\nthe marketing approval process itself usually takes between nine to 12 months.

In\ngeneral, the marketing authorization is valid for ten years and must be renewed at the end of this period. In certain cases, a\nmarketing authorization may be granted on the basis of incomplete clinical research information, following the signing of a\nTermofCommitmentbetweenANVISAandthecompanyholdingthemarketingauthorization.Inthiscase,theinitialperiodof\nvalidity of the marketing authorization is three years, and ANVISA may condition its renewal on the provision of additional\ninformation.Withregardtotheidentificationofaproduct,inadditiontothefederalregistrationnumber,inmostcasesproducts\nare identified and prescribed by the name of the molecule (Brazilian or International Nonproprietary Names - DCB or DCI),\nalthoughinthecaseofinnovativedrugstheymayalsobeidentifiedbythetrademark.\n39\nProduct pricing and reimbursement vary as well. Canada’s pricing of patented pharmaceuticals is controlled by the\nPatented Medicine Prices Review Board, or PMPRB, whose regulatory authority is established by the Patented Medicines\nRegulations under Canada’s Patent Act. The PMPRB is a regulatory board unique to Canada. In the last several years, the\nPMPRB has undergone and continues to undergo significant change, including with respect to the PMPRB’s pricing review\nprocessandrelatedguidelines.Variousotherregulatorybodiesareinvolvedinthepricingofpharmaceuticalsthatarepublicly\nfunded in Canada, including the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, the Institut national d’excellence en\nsantéetenservicessociaux,thepanCanadianPharmaceuticalPricingAlliance,andpublicpayors(e.g.,thefederal,provincial,\nandterritorialpublicdrugplans).EachprovinceandterritoryinCanadahaveitsownlegislationand/orguidancerelatingtothe\npricing and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals, the permitted upcharges for wholesalers and pharmacies, the applicable\ndispensing fees, and whether rebates and professional allowances to pharmacies are prohibited or permitted. Approximately\n44%ofpharmaceuticalssoldinCanadaarepaidforbythepublicdrugplans;theremainderarepaidforprivately(e.g.,covered\nby private insurance or paid for out-of-pocket by individuals).

This issue has been widely discussed in Brazil, particularly in the higher courts, due to the large number of\njudicialrequestsforthesupplyofmedicinesbythefederal,stateormunicipalgovernments.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines,\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal\nprosecution.InCanada,contraventionofthefederalFoodandDrugsAct,orF&DA,(governsallaspectsofthemanufacturing,\nimporting, labelling, distribution and sale of pharmaceuticals) and its regulations may result in various enforcement actions\nfromHealthCanada,includingnoticeletters,requestforplanforcorrectivemeasures,publicadvisories,additionalrestrictions\nto our licenses or product authorization, recall, seizure, forfeiture and destruction of our products, refusal, suspension,\ncancellation or revocation of our authorization, license or registration. In the event of a contravention of the F&DA, Health\nCanada determines the most appropriate level of intervention depending on the severity of the risk posed by regulatory non-\ncompliance. In certain circumstances, the regulatory enforcement responses are not appropriate to achieve compliance, and\nHealthCanadamayinvestigatepotentialcriminaloffencesundertheF&DAand/orrefertolawenforcementforprosecutionin\nrelation to offences under the F&DA and the Criminal Code of Canada.

To that end, we have built and continue to scale a global commercial operation\nwhich has been designed to sequentially manage multiple product launches across multiple geographies. Over the last several\nyears, we have been building commercial capabilities and leveraging the internal knowledge we have accumulated as well as\nhiring talented people with broad industry experience to enable us to commercialize our products ourselves and with\ncollaborators in key countries globally. The conduct of these commercial activities will continue to be dependent upon\nregulatoryapprovalsandonagreementsthatwehavemadeormaymakeinthefuturewithstrategiccollaborators,currentlyas\nfollowswithrespecttoourfirstfiveapprovedproductsandourlate-stageclinicalprograms:\n• With respect to our ATTR amyloidosis franchise, we have global rights to develop and commercialize both\nONPATTROandAMVUTTRA;\n• With respect to our Ultra Rare franchise, we have global rights to develop and commercialize GIVLAARI and\nOXLUMO;\n41\n• For Leqvio, we granted MDCO, which was acquired by Novartis in January 2020, global rights to develop and\ncommercialize;and\n• Forfitusiran,Sanofihasglobalrightstodevelopandcommercializefitusiranandanyback-upsasaresultofthe2018\namendmenttotheSanoficollaborationandtherelatedproduct-specificlicenseterms.\nThroughout the development of our product candidates, we have remained focused on keeping patients at the center of\neverything we do.

Outside of the U.S. we believe we have made strong\nprogress in terms of patient access and have established availability of our TTR (ONPATTRO, AMVUTTRA) and Ultra Rare\n(OXLUMO and GIVLAARI) therapies in more than 60 markets through direct reimbursement or in partnership with our\ndistributors.Inaddition,wehavebeenencouragedbythestrengthoftheadoptionofAMVUTTRAinkeylaunchmarketsand\nexpectcontinuedexpansionacrossglobalmarkets.\nWe are continuing to augment the key components of a global commercial organization with a focus on successfully\nlaunching our commercially approved products around the world and preparing for the anticipated commercial launches of\nadditional RNAi therapeutics, assuming successful development and regulatory approval. With respect to commercially\napproved products, throughout 2023, we continued to build our commercial capabilities, and are continuing to expand these\ncapabilities to additional countries globally.

For example, in August and September 2022, we reported positive safety and efficacy results from the\nAPOLLO-B Phase 3 clinical trial of patisiran, which was designed and powered to evaluate the effects of patisiran on\nfunctional capacity and quality of life in patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy.

Moreover, we cannot be certain that our collaborators, including Novartis, will continue to successfully\nexecutetheirobligationsunderourcollaborationagreementsandgeneratecollaborationandroyaltyrevenuesforus.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in discovering, developing and commercializing novel product\ncandidates with significant market potential.

If our collaborators are not\nsuccessful in their development and/or commercialization efforts, our future revenues from the relevant product or product\ncandidate may be adversely affected. For example, in December 2020 Novartis received a complete response letter from the\nFDA stating that the FDA could not approve the NDA by the PDUFA action date due to unresolved inspection-related\nconditions at a third party manufacturing facility. While Leqvio was ultimately approved by the FDA in December 2021, the\nresolution of the complete response letter resulted in a delay in the payment of an approval milestone and potential U.S.\nroyalties.

The failure of any CMO to meet\nrequired regulatory authority requirements could result in the delayed submission of regulatory applications, or delays in\nreceiving regulatory approval for any of our or our current or future collaborators’ product candidates. For example, in April\n2022, due to an amendment to our vutrisiran NDA submission to address a pending inspection classification at a third-party\nsecondary packaging and labeling facility, the FDA extended the review timeline of the NDA. In addition, if we receive the\nnecessary regulatory approval for any product candidate, we also expect to rely on third parties, including potentially our\ncommercialcollaborators,toproducematerialsrequiredforcommercialsupply.\nTo the extent that we have existing, or enter into future, manufacturing arrangements with third parties, we depend, and\nwilldependinthefuture,onthesethirdpartiestoperformtheirobligationsinatimelymannerandconsistentwithcontractual\nand regulatory requirements, including those related to quality control and quality assurance.

Nonclinical and clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete\nand is uncertain as to outcome, and the historical failure rate for product candidates is high. We currently have multiple\nprograms in clinical development, including internal and collaborated programs in Phase 3 development, as well as several\nearlier-stageclinicalprograms.However,wemaynotbeabletofurtheradvanceanyofourproductcandidatesthroughclinical\ntrialsandregulatoryapproval.\nIfweenterintoclinicaltrials,theresultsfromnonclinicaltestingorearlyorlatestageclinicaltrialsofaproductcandidate\nmay not predict the results that will be obtained in subsequent subjects or in subsequent human clinical trials of that product\ncandidate or any other product candidate. For example, we are conducting the HELIOS-B Phase 3 clinical trial of vutrisiran,\nwhich is investigating the potential of vutrisiran to treat the cardiac manifestations of disease in patients with ATTR\namyloidosiswithcardiomyopathy.WhilevutrisiranhasdemonstratedpositiveresultsinpatientswithhATTRamyloidosiswith\npolyneuropathy,wecannotbecertainthattheresultsfromHELIOS-BwillbepositiveorthattheresultsfromHELIOS-Bwill\nsupport approval of vutrisiran for the treatment of patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. There is a high\nfailure rate for drugs proceeding through clinical studies. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology\nindustries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical development even after achieving promising results in earlier studies,\nandanysuchsetbacksinourclinicaldevelopment,includingwithrespecttovutrisiran,couldhaveamaterialadverseeffecton\nour business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, our approved products and our current product\ncandidates, employ novel delivery technologies that, with the exception of inclisiran, have yet to be extensively evaluated in\nhumanclinicaltrialsandprovensafeandeffective.\nAdditionally,severalofourplannedandongoingclinicaltrialsutilizean“open-label”trialdesign.An“open-label”clinical\ntrial is one where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational product candidate\nor either an existing approved drug or placebo. Most typically, open-label clinical trials test only the investigational product\ncandidateandsometimesmaydosoatdifferentdoselevels.Open-labelclinicaltrialsaresubjecttovariouslimitationsthatmay\nexaggerate any therapeutic effect as patients in open-label clinical trials are aware when they are receiving treatment.\nAccordingly, open-label clinical trials may be subject to a “patient bias” where patients perceive their symptoms to have\nimproved merely due to their awareness of receiving an experimental treatment. In addition, open-label clinical trials may be\nsubjecttoan“investigatorbias”wherethoseassessingandreviewingthephysiologicaloutcomesoftheclinicaltrialsareaware\nof which patients have received treatment and may interpret the information of the treated group more favorably given this\nknowledge. The results from an open-label trial may not be predictive of future clinical trial results with any of our product\ncandidateswhenstudiedinablinded,controlledenvironmentwithaplacebooractivecontrol.\nIn addition, we, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities, or an institutional review board, or IRB, or similar\nforeign review board or committee, may delay initiation of or suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for\nvarious reasons, including if we or they believe the healthy volunteer subjects or patients participating in such trials are being\nexposed to unacceptable health risks. Among other reasons, adverse side effects of a product candidate or related product on\nhealthy volunteer subjects or patients in a clinical trial could result in our decision, or a decision by the FDA or foreign\nregulatory authority, to suspend or terminate the clinical trial, or, in the case of regulatory agencies, a refusal to approve a\nparticularproductcandidateforanyorallindicationsofuse.\n55\nClinicaltrialsofanewproductcandidaterequiretheenrollmentofasufficientnumberofpatients,includingpatientswho\naresufferingfromthediseasetheproductcandidateisintendedtotreatandwhomeetothereligibilitycriteria.Ratesofpatient\nenrollmentareaffectedbymanyfactors,includingthesizeofthepatientpopulation,theageandconditionofthepatients,the\nstageandseverityofdisease,theavailabilityofclinicaltrialsforotherinvestigationaldrugsforthesamediseaseorcondition,\nthe nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant\ndisease,andtheeligibilitycriteriafortheclinicaltrial.Weorourcollaboratorsmayexperiencedifficultyenrollingourclinical\ntrials due to the availability of existing approved treatments, as well as other investigational treatments in development. For\nexample, in November 2018 we announced that due to recruitment challenges, we had discontinued a Phase 2 study of\ncemdisiraninatypicalhemolyticuremicsyndromeandwerefocusingourcemdisiranclinicaldevelopmenteffortsinadifferent\nindication. Delays or difficulties in patient enrollment, or difficulties retaining trial participants, including as a result of the\navailability of existing approved treatments or other investigational treatments or safety concerns, including the impact of\npandemics or other public health emergencies, can result in increased costs, longer development times or termination of a\nclinicaltrial.\nAlthough our RNAi therapeutics have been generally well-tolerated in our clinical trials to date, new safety findings may\nemerge. The occurrence of serious adverse events, or SAEs, and/or adverse events, or AEs, can result in the suspension or\ntermination of clinical trials of a product candidate by us, our collaborators, or the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority, and\nmay negatively impact the clinical and/or regulatory timelines of the impacted product candidates. For example, in October\n2016,wediscontinuedourrevusiranprogramandinSeptember2017,weannouncedthatwehadtemporarilysuspendeddosing\nin all ongoing fitusiran studies pending further review of a fatal thrombotic SAE that occurred in a patient who was receiving\nfitusiran in our Phase 2 OLE study. More recently, in October 2020, Sanofi voluntarily paused dosing in all ongoing fitusiran\nclinical studies to assess reports of non-fatal thrombotic events in patients participating in the ATLAS Phase 3 program.\nFollowing an assessment of available data and alignment with regulators, patients restarted on fitusiran under amended\nprotocols in ongoing clinical studies and, in October 2021, Sanofi announced that a potential filing date for fitusiran had been\nmovedto2024duetotheintroductionofareviseddosingregimenintheongoingphase3studies.Inaddition,theoccurrenceof\nSAEs and/or AEs could also result in refusal by the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority to approve a particular product\ncandidateforanyorallindicationsofuse,orinlimitationsinthelabelofanyapprovedproduct.\nInaddition,theoccurrenceofSAEsand/orAEscouldalsoresultinrefusalbytheFDAoraforeignregulatoryauthorityto\napproveaparticularproductcandidateforanyorallindicationsofuse,orinlimitationsinthelabelofanyapprovedproduct.\nClinical trials also require the review, oversight and approval of IRBs, or, outside of the U.S., independent ethics\ncommittees, which continually review clinical investigations and protect the rights and welfare of human subjects.

Rigorous nonclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory\napprovalprocessarerequiredtobesuccessfullycompletedintheU.S.andinmanyforeignjurisdictionsbeforeanewdrugcan\nbe marketed. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to\nunanticipated delays. It is possible that the product candidates we and our collaborators are developing will not obtain the\nregulatory approvals necessary for us or our collaborators to begin selling them, or, in the case of vutrisiran, will not obtain\nregulatoryapprovaltobesoldforabroaderindicationthantheindicationforwhichitiscurrentlyapproved.Itisalsopossible\nthattheFDAorotherregulatoryauthoritiesmaydeterminethatthedatageneratedinclinicaltrialsforaproductcandidateisnot\nsufficienttosupporttheapprovalofanapplicationforregulatoryapproval.Forexample,althoughwereportedpositiveresults\nfrom the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study of patisiran in patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, and received a 9:3\nvote from the FDA’s CRDAC that patisiran’s benefits outweighed its risks for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis with\ncardiomyopathy,inOctober2023,theFDAissuedaCRLinresponsetooursNDAforpatisiran,indicatingthesNDAcouldnot\nbeapprovedinitspresentform.\nThetimerequiredtoobtainFDAandotherregulatoryapprovalsisunpredictablebuttypicallytakesmanyyearsfollowing\nthecommencementofclinicaltrials,dependinguponthetype,complexityandnoveltyoftheproductcandidate.Thestandards\nthattheFDAanditsforeigncounterpartsusewhenregulatingusarenotalwaysappliedinapredictableoruniformmannerand\ncan change over time. Any analysis we perform of data from nonclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and\ninterpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We or our collaborators may\nalsoencounterunexpecteddelaysorincreasedcostsduetonewgovernmentregulations,forexample,fromfuturelegislationor\nadministrative action, or from changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA\nregulatory review. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA or foreign\nregulations,guidanceorinterpretationswillbechanged,orwhattheimpactofsuchchanges,ifany,maybe.\nBecause the product candidates we or our collaborators are developing represent a new class of drug, the FDA and its\nforeigncounterpartshavenotyetestablishedanydefinitivepolicies,practicesorguidelinesinrelationtothesedrugs.Thelack\nofpolicies,practicesorguidelinesmayhinderorslowreviewbytheFDAofanyregulatoryfilingsthatweorourcollaborators\nmay submit. Moreover, the FDA may respond to these submissions by defining requirements we or our collaborators may not\nhave anticipated. Such responses could lead to significant delays and increased costs in the development of our or our\ncollaboratedproductcandidates.Inaddition,becausetheremaybeapprovedtreatmentsforsomeofthediseasesforwhichwe\nor our collaborators may seek approval, including vutrisiran for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, or\n57\ntreatments in development which are approved by the time we or our collaborators file for approval, in order to receive\nregulatoryapproval,weortheymayneedtodemonstratethroughclinicaltrialsthattheproductcandidateswedeveloptotreat\nthese diseases are not only safe and effective, but safer and/or more effective than existing approved products.

During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA\nworkedtoensuretimelyreviewsofapplicationsformedicalproductsinlinewithitsuserfeeperformancegoalsandconducted\nmissioncriticaldomesticandforeigninspectionstoensurecomplianceofmanufacturingfacilitieswithFDAqualitystandards.\nIn addition, during the COVID-19 public health emergency, a number of companies announced receipt of complete response\nlettersduetotheFDA’sinabilitytocompleterequiredinspectionsfortheirapplications.InDecember2020,theFDAissueda\nCRLregardingNovartis’NDAforinclisiran,statingthattheagencycouldnotapprovetheNDAbythePDUFAactiondatedue\nto unresolved facility inspection-related conditions. In July 2021, Novartis announced that the resubmission to the FDA of the\ninclisiran NDA to address the complete response letter was filed, and the FDA approved Leqvio (the trade name under which\ninclisiran is marketed in the U.S.) in December 2021. This delay in the approval of Leqvio resulted in delayed milestone and\nroyalty revenue to us. Any similar interruption or delay by the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could\nhave a material adverse effect on our or our collaborators’ efforts to obtain regulatory approval for our or our collaborators’\nproduct candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial\ncondition.Forinstance,theFDAmayrequestadditionalclinicalorotherdataorinformationinconnectionwiththeregulatory\nreviewofourorourcollaborators’productcandidates,includingbyissuingacompleteresponseletterwhichmayrequirethat\nwe or our collaborators submit additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure\nfinalapprovalofourorourcollaborators’NDAapplications,includingpotentiallyrequiringafacilityinspection.Evenifsuch\ndataandinformationaresubmitted,oranysuchinspectioniscompleted,theFDAmayultimatelydecidethattheNDAdoesnot\nsatisfythecriteriaforapproval.\nAny delay or failure in obtaining required approvals for our product candidates or our collaborated product candidates\ncould have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues from any product candidate for which we or our\ncollaborators may seek approval in the future. For example, as a result of the recent CRL from the FDA in response to our\nsNDA for patisiran as a treatment for ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, our ability to generate product revenues for\npatisiranwillbenegativelyimpacted.Furthermore,anyregulatoryapprovaltomarketanyproductmaybesubjecttolimitations\non the approved uses for which we or our collaborators may market the product or the labeling or other restrictions, which\ncouldlimiteachsuchproduct’smarketopportunityandhaveanegativeimpactonourbusiness,prospects,operatingresultsand\nfinancial condition and our stock price. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation\nStrategy, or REMS, plan as part of its review of an NDA, or after approval, which may impose further requirements or\nrestrictionsonthedistributionoruseofanapproveddrug,suchaslimitingprescribingtocertainphysiciansormedicalcenters\nthathaveundergonespecializedtraining,limitingtreatmenttopatientswhomeetcertainsafe-usecriteriaandrequiringtreated\npatients to enroll in a registry.

In either instance, these limitations and restrictions may limit the size of the market for our products and affect\nreimbursementbythird-partypayors.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical\ntrials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval\nprocess varies among countries and includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval described above as well as risks\nattributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by\nanyregulatoryauthorityoutsidetheU.S.andviceversa.\nEven if we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approvals, our marketed products will be subject to ongoing regulatory\noversight.

The FDA and other regulatory and enforcement authorities\nactively enforce laws and regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for which\nmarketing approval has not been obtained, and if in the future we are found to have improperly marketed or promoted any of\nour commercial products, we may be subject to a broad range of civil, administrative and criminal penalties, including\ninjunctive relief related to such commercial products’ promotional activities, substantial fines or penalties, and other legal or\nequitable sanctions.

We currently expect to rely on third parties to launch and market certain of our\nproduct candidates in certain geographies, if approved. However, we are commercializing ONPATTRO, AMVUTTRA,\n60\nGIVLAARI and OXLUMO, and intend to commercialize other product candidates, if approved, on our own globally in major\nmarkets. Accordingly, we have developed internal marketing, sales, market access and distribution capabilities as part of our\ncore product strategy initially in the U.S., Europe and Japan, with expansion ongoing globally, which has required, and will\ncontinue to require, significant financial and management resources.

If the actual number of patients suffering from these diseases is smaller than we estimate,\nor if we fail to raise awareness of these diseases and diagnosis is not improved, our business, prospects, operating results\nandfinancialconditionmaybeadverselyaffected.\nOur estimates regarding the potential market size for ONPATTRO, AMVUTTRA, GIVLAARI, OXLUMO or any future\nproducts at the time we commence commercialization, may be materially different from the actual market size, including as a\nresult of the indication approved by regulatory authorities, which could result in significant changes in our business plan and\nmayhaveamaterialadverseeffectonourbusiness,prospects,operatingresultsandfinancialcondition.Inaddition,ourefforts\ntoraisediseaseawarenessandimprovediagnosisofourrelevantdiseasestateswereimpactedbytheCOVID-19pandemic.For\nexample, in 2020 and 2021, we saw a reduction in peer-to-peer educational opportunities, reduced physician attendance at\ncongresses and symposia and overall opportunities for physician engagement. As is the case with most orphan diseases, if we\nare unable to successfully raise awareness of these diseases and improve diagnosis, it could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, prospects, operating results or financial condition, and it will be more difficult or impossible to achieve\nprofitability.\nAny products we currently market or may develop in the future may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations,\nthird-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, thereby harming our business, prospects, operating\nresultsandfinancialcondition.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, coverage, pricing and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from\ncountry to country and are subject to change. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be\nmarketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing authorization or product licensing approval is\ngranted.Insomeforeignmarkets,prescriptionpharmaceuticalpricingremainssubjecttocontinuinggovernmentalcontroleven\nafterinitialapprovalisgranted.Weareactivelymonitoringtheseregulationsaswemarketandsellourapprovedproductsand\nas several of our product candidates move through late stages of development. However, a number of our product candidates\nare currently in the earlier stages of development, and we will not be able to assess the impact of such regulations or any\nchanges to such development programs for a number of years. We might also obtain regulatory approval for a product,\nincluding one or more of our approved products, in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations or price\ncontrolsthatdelayourcommerciallaunchoftheproductand/ornegativelyimpacttherevenuesweareabletogeneratefromthe\nsaleoftheproductinthatcountryandpotentiallyinothercountriesduetoreferencepricing.\nWebelievethattheeffortsofgovernmentsandthird-partypayorstocontainorreducethecostofhealthcareandlegislative\nandregulatoryproposalstobroadentheavailabilityofhealthcarewillcontinuetoaffectthebusinessandfinancialconditionof\npharmaceuticalandbiopharmaceuticalcompanies.IntheU.S.,pharmaceuticalpricingissubjecttobothgovernmentandpublic\nscrutinyandcallsforreform,andtheU.S.governmenthascontinuedtofocusonlegislativeandregulatorychangesdesignedto\ncontrol costs.

These developments could, directly or\nindirectly, affect our ability to sell ONPATTRO, AMVUTTRA, GIVLAARI, OXLUMO or future products, if approved, at a\nfavorableprice.\nAtthefederallevel,forexample,theIRAincludesseveralprovisionsthatwillimpactourbusinesstovaryingdegrees.For\nexample,theIRAmayrequireustopayrebatesifweincreasethecostofaMedicarePartBorPartDdrugfasterthantherate\n61\nof inflation.

Although a number of\ntheseandotherproposedmeasuresmayrequireauthorizationthroughadditionallegislationtobecomeeffective,andthecurrent\nU.S. presidential administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the current U.S. presidential\nadministrationandCongresshaveindicatedthattheywillcontinuetoseeknewmeasurestocontroldrugcosts.\nAt the state level, governments have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations\ndesignedtocontrolpharmaceuticalproductpricing.Someofthesemeasuresincluderestrictingprice,reimbursement,discounts,\nproduct access, and marketing; imposing drug price, cost, and marketing disclosure and transparency requirements; permitting\nimportation from other countries; and encouraging bulk purchasing. For example, on January 5, 2024, the FDA authorized\nFlorida’s Agency for Health Care Administration’s drug importation proposal, the first step toward Florida facilitating\nimportation of certain prescription drugs from Canada. Importation of drugs from Canada and the Most Favored Nation, or\nMFN, Model may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our commercially approved products. In\naddition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what\npharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. These\nmeasurescouldreducetheultimatedemandforourproducts,onceapproved,orputpressureonourproductpricing.Wecannot\npredict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future in the U.S. or other foreign countries.

Interim payments for new drugs, if\napplicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement may be based on\nlower-cost drugs that are already marketed, covered, and reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other\nservices, and may reflect budgetary constraints or imperfections in data. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory\ndiscounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that\npresently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the U.S. In particular,\ngovernments in certain markets such as in EU, the U.K., Japan, and China, provide healthcare at low (or zero) direct costs to\nconsumers at the point of care, and thus have significant power as large single payers to regulate prices or impose other cost\ncontrolmechanisms.Inaddition,theemphasisonmanagedcareintheU.S.hasincreasedandweexpectwillcontinuetoexert\ndownward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing.

The GDPR (i) requires us to inform data subjects of how we process their personal data and how they can\nexercise their rights, (ii) requires us to ensure we have a valid legal basis to process personal data (if this is consent, the\nrequirements for obtaining consent carries a higher threshold), (iii) requires us to appoint a data protection officer where\nsensitive personal data (i.e., health data) is processed on a large scale, (iv) introduces mandatory data breach notification\nrequirements throughout the EEA and UK, (v) requires us to maintain records of our processing activities and document data\nprotection impact assessments where there is high risk processing, (vi) imposes additional obligations on us when we are\ncontracting with service providers, requires (vii) appropriate technical and organizational measures to be put in place to\nsafeguard personal data and (viii) requires us to adopt appropriate privacy governance including policies, procedures, training\nanddataaudit.\nSignificantly, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA and UK to the U.S. or other\nregionsthathavenotbeendeemedtooffer“adequate”privacyprotections.Inthepast,companiesintheU.S.wereabletorely\nupontheEU-U.S.,UK-U.S.andtheSwiss-U.S.PrivacyShieldframeworksasabasisforlawfultransferofpersonaldatafrom\nthe EU and the UK to the U.S. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, in Case C-311/18 (Data\nProtectionCommissionervFacebookIrelandandMaximillianSchrems,orSchremsII)invalidatedtheEU-U.S.PrivacyShield\non the grounds that the Privacy Shield failed to offer adequate protections to EU personal data transferred to the U.S. The\nCJEU,inthesamedecision,deemedthattheStandardContractualClauses,orSCCs,publishedbytheECarevalid.However,\nthe CJEU ruled that transfers made pursuant to the SCCs need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis to ensure the law in the\nrecipient country provides “essentially equivalent” protections to safeguard the transferred personal data as the EU, and\nrequired businesses to adopt supplementary measures if such standard is not met. Subsequent guidance published by the\nEuropeanDataProtectionBoard,orEDPB,inJune2021describedwhatsuchsupplementarymeasuresmustbe,andstatedthat\nbusinessesshouldavoidorceasetransfersofpersonaldataif,intheabsenceofsupplementarymeasures,equivalentprotections\ncannotbeafforded.OnJune4,2021,theECpublishednewversionsoftheSCCs,whichseektoaddresstheissuesidentifiedby\nthe CJEU’s Schrems II decision and provide further details regarding the transfer assessments that the parties are required to\nconduct when implementing the new SCCs. However, there continue to be concerns about whether the SCCs and other\n66\nmechanisms will face additional challenges. Similarly, in September 2020, the Swiss data protection authority determined the\nSwiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework was no longer a valid mechanism for Swiss-U.S. data transfers and raised questions\nabout the validity of the SCCs as a mechanism for transferring personal data from Switzerland.

The adequacy decision concluded that the U.S. ensures an adequate level of protection for personal\ndata transferred from the EU to US companies under the new framework, and the EC stated that as a result personal data can\nflow safely from the EU to US companies participating in the framework, without having to put in place additional data\nprotection safeguards. The EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework is subject to periodic reviews, to be conducted by the EC,\ntogetherwithotherEuropeandataprotectionauthoritiesandU.S.authorities,withthefirstreviewtotakeplacewithinayearof\nadoption of the adequacy decision.

However, we may not hold proprietary rights to some patents\nrequired for us to manufacture and commercialize our proposed products. Because certain U.S. patent applications are\nconfidential until the patents issue, such as applications filed prior to November 29, 2000, or applications filed after such date\nwhich will not be filed in foreign countries, third parties may have filed patent applications for subject matter covered by our\npending patent applications without our being aware of those applications, and our patent applications may not have priority\nover those applications. For this and other reasons, we may be unable to secure desired patent rights, thereby losing desired\nexclusivity.Further,weorourcollaboratorsmayberequiredtoobtainlicensesunderthird-partypatentstomarketoneormore\nof our or our collaborator’s approved products, or further develop and commercialize future products, or continue to develop\nproductcandidatesinourpipelinebeingdevelopedbyusorourcollaborators.Iflicensesarenotavailabletousornotavailable\nonreasonableterms,weorourlicenseesmaynotbeabletomarkettheaffectedproductsorconductthedesiredactivities.\nOurstrategydependsonourabilitytorapidlyidentifyandseekpatentprotectionforourdiscoveries.Inaddition,wemay\nrely on third-party collaborators to file patent applications relating to proprietary technology that we develop jointly as part of\ncollaborations. The process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming. If we or our present or future\ncollaborators fail to file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost and in a timely\nmanner, our business may be adversely affected. Despite our efforts and the efforts of our collaborators to protect our\nproprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. While issued\npatentsarepresumedvalid,thisdoesnotguaranteethatthepatentwillsurviveavaliditychallengeorbeheldenforceable.Any\npatents we have obtained, or obtain in the future, may be challenged, invalidated, adjudged unenforceable or circumvented by\npartiesattemptingtodesignaroundourintellectualproperty.Moreover,thirdpartiesortheUnitedStatesPatentandTrademark\nOffice, or USPTO, may commence interference proceedings involving our patents or patent applications.

The patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology\ncompanies,includingours,isgenerallyuncertainandinvolvescomplexlegalandfactualconsiderations.Thestandardsthatthe\nUSPTO and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change.\nSimilarly, the ultimate degree of protection that will be afforded to biotechnology inventions, including ours, in the U.S. and\nforeign countries, remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of the protection decided upon by patent offices, courts\nand lawmakers. Moreover, there are periodic discussions in the U.S. Congress and in international jurisdictions about\nmodifying various aspects of patent law. For example, the America Invents Act, or AIA, included a number of changes to the\npatentlawsoftheU.S.Ifanyoftheenactedchangesdonotprovideadequateprotectionfordiscoveries,includingourabilityto\npursue infringers of our patents for substantial damages, our business could be adversely affected.

In addition, we\nsublicense our rights under various third-party licenses to our collaborators. Any impairment of these sublicensed rights could\nresult in reduced revenues under our collaboration agreements or result in termination of an agreement by one or more of our\ncollaborators.\nOther companies or organizations may challenge our patent rights or may assert patent rights that prevent us from\ndevelopingandcommercializingourproducts.\nRNAi is a relatively new scientific field, the commercial exploitation of which has resulted in many different patents and\npatentapplicationsfromorganizationsandindividualsseekingtoobtainpatentprotectioninthefield.Wehaveobtainedgrants\nand issuances of RNAi patents and have licensed many of these patents from third parties on an exclusive basis. The issued\npatents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in key markets around the world that we own or license claim many\ndifferent methods, compositions and processes relating to the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of\nRNAitherapeutics.\nSpecifically, we have a portfolio of patents, patent applications and other intellectual property covering, among other\nthings: fundamental aspects of the structure and uses of siRNAs, including their use as therapeutics, and RNAi-related\nmechanisms;chemicalmodificationstosiRNAsthatimprovetheirsuitabilityfortherapeuticandotheruses;siRNAsdirectedto\nspecifictargetsastreatmentsforparticulardiseases;deliverytechnologies,suchasinthefieldsofcarbohydrateconjugatesand\ncationicliposomes;andallaspectsofourspecificdevelopmentcandidates.\nAs the field of RNAi therapeutics is maturing, patent applications are being fully processed by national patent offices\naround the world. There is uncertainty about which patents will issue, and, if they do, as to when, to whom, and with what\nclaims. It is likely that there will be significant litigation and other proceedings, such as interference, re-examination and\nopposition proceedings, as well as pre- and post-grant review proceedings in various patent offices relating to patent rights in\nthe RNAi field. In addition, third parties may challenge the validity of our patents. For example, a third party has filed an\n70\nopposition in the European Patent Office, or EPO, against our owned patent EP 2723758, with claims directed to RNAi\ncompositions and methods for silencing ANGPTL3, arguing that the granted claims are invalid. Following an oral hearing in\nFebruary2021,thepatentwasrevoked.AnoticeofappealoftheEPO’sdecisionwasfiledinJune2021andfollowinganoral\nhearing in November 2023, the appeal was dismissed resulting in the patent remaining revoked.

Additionally, the validity of two Chinese patents\n(ZL201380063930.5 and ZL201810143112.0) relating to inclisiran were challenged by a third party in China.

The timing and outcome of these and other proceedings is uncertain and may adversely affect our business,\nprospects, operating results and financial condition if we are not successful in defending the patentability and scope of our\npending and issued patent claims.

Utah was\nseeking correction of inventorship of the Tuschl patents, unspecified damages and other relief. After several years of court\nproceedings and discovery, the court granted our motions for summary judgment and dismissed Utah’s state law damages\nclaims. During the pendency of this litigation, as well as the Dicerna litigation described below, we incurred significant costs,\nand in each case, the litigation diverted the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise have been\nengagedinotheractivities.\nWe may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of\nproprietary rights of others or protect our proprietary information and trade secrets. For example, during the second quarter of\n2015, we filed a trade secret misappropriation lawsuit against Dicerna to protect our rights in the RNAi assets we purchased\nfromMerckSharp&DohmeCorp.,orMerck.InApril2018,weandDicernasettledallclaimsinthelitigationbetweenus.In\n71\nMarch 2022, we announced that we separately filed suit in United States District Court for the District of Delaware against\nPfizer and Moderna seeking damages for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 11,246,933, or the ’933 patent in the parties’\nmanufacture and sale of their messenger RNA, or mRNA, COVID-19 vaccines. Pfizer joined BioNTech SE, or BioNTech, to\nthe suit and filed counterclaims. In July 2022, we filed an additional lawsuit in United States District Court for the District of\nDelaware against each of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna seeking damages for infringing U.S. Patent No. 11,382,979, or the\n’979 patent. The court combined the two patents in a single suit for each of Pfizer/BioNTech, or the 2022 Lawsuit, and\nModerna with trial dates set for each in November 2024. On May 26, 2023, we filed additional lawsuits against Pfizer and\nModerna in Delaware seeking damages for infringing U.S. Patent No. 11,590,229 in the United States District Court for the\nDistrictofDelaware.Inadditiontothispatent,weaddedU.S.PatentNos.11,633,479and11,633,480inthemorerecentlyfiled\nsuitsagainstbothPfizerandModernaandalsoU.S.PatentNo.11,612,657againstPfizeronly.OnAugust9,2023,aMarkman\nhearingwasheldintheU.S.DistrictCourtfortheDistrictofDelawaretoconsiderthemeaningofthreedisputedtermsasused\ninthe’933and’979patents,andonAugust21,2023,thecourtissuedanorderconstruingtwoofthethreeterms,anddeferreda\nruling on the third term.

Ionis later\nfiled a Demand for Arbitration with the Boston office of the American Arbitration Association against us, asserting, among\nother things, breach of contract. Upon completion of the arbitration process in the second quarter of 2020, in October 2020, a\npartial award was issued by the arbitration panel that sought additional information from us. The arbitration panel issued its\nfinal award in December 2020, which ruled in favor of Ionis’s request for a TAF on certain rights the panel determined we\nreceivedintheSanofirestructuring(butrejectedtheTAFamountsoughtbyIonis),andinfavorofusindenyingIonis’srequest\nforaTAFonamilestonepaymentreceivedbyusinthesamerestructuring.Thepanel’sfinalawardalsodeniedIonis’srequest\nfor pre-judgement interest and attorney’s fees.

Therefore, even if we successfully develop and\ncommercializeproducts,wemaybeunabletoachieveormaintainprofitability.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other\nproprietaryinformation.\nIn order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our\ncollaborators, employees, consultants, scientific advisors, CMOs, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers,\nand other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide\nan adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, other third parties may\nindependently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights\nagainst such party. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our\nproprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our business, prospects,\noperatingresultsandfinancialcondition.\nRisksRelatedtoCompetition\nThe pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive. If we or our collaborators are unable to compete effectively with\nexisting drugs, new treatment methods and new technologies, we or our collaborators may be unable to commercialize\nsuccessfullyanydrugsthatweorourcollaboratorsdevelop.\nThe pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive and rapidly changing.

In addition, BridgeBio\nannounced positive results from its Phase 3 clinical trial of acoramidis, a TTR stabilizer, in ATTR amyloidosis with\ncardiomyopathy in July 2023, and announced in February 2024 that the FDA has accepted its NDA for filing.

In addition, in December\n2023, the FDA approved WAINUA (eplontersen), a drug developed by Ionis in partnership with AstraZeneca plc, for the\ntreatment of hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. There are also product candidates in various stages of clinical\ndevelopment for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. While we believe that ONPATTRO and\nAMVUTTRA have and will continue to have a competitive product profile for the treatment of patients with hATTR\namyloidosis with polyneuropathy, it is possible that ONPATTRO and/or AMVUTTRA may not compete favorably with these\nproductsandproductcandidates,orothers,and,asaresult,maynotachievecommercialsuccess.\nIf we or our collaborators continue to successfully develop product candidates, and obtain approval for them, we and our\ncollaboratorswillfacecompetitionbasedonmanydifferentfactors,including:\n• thesafetyandeffectivenessofourorourcollaborators’productsrelativetoalternativetherapies,ifany;\n• the ease with which our or our collaborators’ products can be administered and the extent to which patients accept\nrelativelynewroutesofadministration;\n• thetimingandscopeofregulatoryapprovalsfortheseproducts;\n• theavailabilityandcostofmanufacturing,marketingandsalescapabilities;\n• thepriceofourorourcollaborators’productsrelativetoalternativeapprovedtherapies;\n• reimbursementcoverage;and\n• patentposition.\nWe are aware of product candidates in various stages of clinical development for the treatment of PH1 which would\ncompetewithOXLUMO,ourRNAitherapeuticapprovedintheU.S.andEUforthetreatmentofthisdisease,includingNovo\nNordisk’sproductRIVFLOZA(nedosiran),whichwasapprovedforthetreatmentofPH1inSeptember2023andisexpectedto\nlaunchin2024.RIVFLOZAisaonce-monthlysubcutaneousRNAitherapythatwasdevelopedbyDicerna.InApril2020,we\nand Dicerna granted each other a non-exclusive cross-license to our respective intellectual property related to lumasiran and\nDicerna’s nedosiran. In addition, several companies have investigational drugs in clinical development for the treatment of\nPH1,includingBridgeBio,ChinookTherapeutics,Inc.,andBioMarinPharmaceutical,Inc.\nOur competitors may develop or commercialize products with significant advantages over any products we or our\ncollaborators develop based on any of the factors listed above or on other factors. In addition, our competitors may develop\ncollaborations with or receive funding from larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, providing them with an\nadvantage over us and our collaborators. Our competitors may therefore be more successful in commercializing their products\nthan we or our collaborators are, which could adversely affect our competitive position and business, prospects, operating\nresults and financial condition. Competitive products may make any products we or our collaborators develop obsolete or\nnoncompetitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our product candidates.

In addition, we granted licenses or options for licenses to Ionis, Benitec Biopharma Ltd., Arrowhead, Arbutus,\n74\nQuark, Sylentis and other companies under which these companies may independently develop RNAi therapeutics against a\nlimited number of targets. Any one of these companies may develop its RNAi technology more rapidly and more effectively\nthan we do. In addition, as a result of agreements that we have entered into, Takeda has obtained a non-exclusive license, and\nArrowhead, as the assignee of Novartis, has obtained specific exclusive licenses for 30 gene targets, that include access to\ncertainaspectsofourtechnology.\nWe and our collaborators also compete with companies working to develop antisense-based drugs. Similar to RNAi\ntherapeutics, antisense drugs target mRNAs in order to suppress the activity of specific genes. Akcea Therapeutics, Inc., a\nwholly owned subsidiary of Ionis, has received marketing approval for an antisense drug, inotersen for the treatment of adult\nhATTR amyloidosis patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy. Several antisense drugs developed by Ionis have been\napproved and are currently marketed, and Ionis has multiple antisense product candidates in clinical trials.

Our\ncybersecurityprogramisbasedonindustrystandardCIScriticalsecuritycontrols.ThetoprisksfacingourCompany,including\nthose related to cybersecurity, are included in our overall enterprise risk management program that is managed by a cross-\nfunctionalgroupchairedbyourcomplianceandinternalauditfunctions.\nTo assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats to our information systems and the associated\ncosts, our cybersecurity program prioritizes vulnerability management and risk reduction, detection and prevention. As part of\nthis program, we conduct continuous monitoring for anomalous behavior using a third-party security operations center. In\naddition, we conduct an annual cybersecurity risk assessment in conjunction with our third-party consultant that specializes in\ninformation security, and we incorporate recommendations from the risk assessment into our cybersecurity strategy, as\nappropriate. This risk assessment process considers the nature of our business, requirements from our internal and external\nstakeholders, and industry trends and risks, including new and emerging risks. By continuously assessing the cybersecurity\nlandscape, we develop targeted strategies that identify and address the risks most likely to impact our company. We also\nconductatleastonecybersecurityincidenttabletopexerciseeachyeartotestandenhanceourincidentresponseplans.\nOurcybersecurityprogramisdesignedtodetectandpreventdisruptiontocriticalinformationsystems,minimizethelossor\nmanipulation of sensitive information, efficiently remediate and recover from cybersecurity incidents and ensure compliance\nwith regulations and disclosure requirements. Pursuant to our processes, when a cybersecurity incident occurs, we convene a\ncross-functional incident response team whose membership is dictated by the severity of the incident but in all instances\nincludes representatives from our information technology, legal and accounting departments. This cross-functional\nrepresentationallowsustoleveragediverseperspectivesandexpertisewhenaddressingcybersecurityeventsandtoanalyzethe\npotential financial, legal, operational, and reputational implications of an incident, thereby enabling us to make informed\ndecisions and take appropriate actions. This incident response framework further enables us to quickly assess the severity of\ncybersecurity incidents and the materiality of incidents based on pre-defined criteria that considers both quantitative and\nqualitative factors to determine the appropriate response. Identified incidents are then escalated to the relevant management\nteams based on their severity, allowing for a swift determination of materiality and an effective mitigation process.

For example, we collect,\nstore and transmit sensitive information including intellectual property, proprietary business information, including highly\nsensitiveclinicaltrialdata,andpersonalinformationinconnectionwithourbusinessoperations.Thesecuremaintenanceofthis\ninformation is critical to our operations and business strategy. If this information was subject to a cybersecurity attack or\nunauthorized access or use, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and could expose us to potential legal\nconsequences, liabilities, mitigation costs, and damage to our reputation. Managing cybersecurity incidents would also divert\nmanagement’sattentionandresourcesfromregularbusinessoperations.\nWebelievethatourcurrentcybersecurityprogramprovidesadequatemeasuresofprotectionagainstcybersecuritybreaches\nand generally reduces our risks. However, cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, becoming more frequent and more\nsophisticated and are being made by groups of individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives, which increases the\ndifficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. While we have implemented measures to safeguard our\noperational and technology systems and have established a culture of monitoring and improvement, the evolving nature of\ncybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities means that these protections may not always be effective. However, our management\nhas determined that, during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no cybersecurity threats, including as a\nresult of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our\ncompany,includingourbusinessstrategy,operatingresults,orfinancialcondition.\nGovernance\nOur board of directors is responsible for cybersecurity risk management and oversight of our cybersecurity program.

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements\nrequires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these\nestimates under different assumptions or conditions and could have a material impact on our reported results. While our\nsignificant accounting policies are more fully described in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in\nunderstandingthejudgmentsandestimatesweuseinpreparingourconsolidatedfinancialstatements:\nNetProductRevenues\nOur net product revenues are recognized, net of variable consideration related to certain allowances and accruals, at the\ntime the customer obtains control of our product. We record reserves, based on contractual terms, for components related to\nproductsoldduringthereportingperiod,aswellasourestimateofproductthatremainsinthedistributionchannelinventoryat\ntheendofthereportingperiodthatweexpectwillbesoldtoqualifiedhealthcareproviders.Onaquarterlybasis,weupdateour\nestimatesandrecordanyneededadjustmentsintheperiodweidentifytheadjustments.\nThe estimates for our product revenue allowances and accruals are most significantly affected by chargebacks, which are\ncontractual commitments with the government and other entities to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices\nlower than the list prices charged to the customer who directly purchases from us, and rebates that represent discount\nobligations under government programs, including Medicaid in the U.S. and similar programs in certain other countries,\nincluding countries in which we are accruing for estimated rebates because final pricing has not yet been negotiated. We are\nalsosubjecttopotentialrebatesinconnectionwithourvalue-basedagreements,orVBAs,withcertaincommercialpayors.\n89\nWeusetheexpectedvaluemethod,whichisthesumofprobability-weightedamountsinarangeofpossibleconsideration\namounts, or the most likely amount method, which is the single most likely amount in a range of possible considerations, to\nestimate variable consideration related to our product revenues. We use the expected value method to estimate variable\nconsideration for chargebacks, certain rebates, and other incentives and we use the most likely amount method for certain\nrebatesandtradediscountsandallowances.\nA10%increaseordecreaseintheseestimatesimpactsnetsalesbyacorrespondingincreaseordecreaseofapproximately\n$13.0million.\nNetRevenuesfromCollaborations\nWe earn revenue in connection with collaboration agreements which allow our collaborators to utilize our technology\nplatformsanddevelopproductcandidates.\nFor elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Topic\n606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, we identify the performance obligations and allocate the total\nconsiderationweexpecttoreceiveonarelativestandalonesellingpricebasistoeachperformanceobligation.Keyassumptions\nto determine the standalone selling price may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for\npersonnel costs, the expected number of targets or indications expected to be pursued under each license, discount rates and\nprobabilities of technical and regulatory success. We recognize revenue associated with each performance obligation as the\ncontrol over the promised goods or services transfer to our collaborator which occurs either at a point in time or over time.

Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the\nriskthatamaterialweaknessexists,andtestingandevaluatingthedesignandoperatingeffectivenessofinternalcontrolbased\non the assessed risk.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositionsoftheassetsofthecompany;(ii)providereasonableassurancethattransactionsarerecordedasnecessarytopermit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndispositionofthecompany’sassetsthatcouldhaveamaterialeffectonthefinancialstatements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecauseofchangesinconditions,orthatthedegreeofcompliancewiththepoliciesorproceduresmaydeteriorate.\nCriticalAuditMatters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or\ndisclosuresthatarematerialtotheconsolidatedfinancialstatementsand(ii)involvedourespeciallychallenging,subjective,or\n93\ncomplex judgments.

Interest on the liability related to the sale of future royalties will be recognized using\nthe effective interest rate method, resulting in the recognition of interest expense. Management periodically assesses the\nexpected payments and to the extent the amount or timing of the future estimated payments is materially different than the\nprevious estimates, management accounts for any such change by adjusting the liability related to the sale of future royalties\nand prospectively recognizing the related non-cash interest expense. Management’s estimate of the amount of expected future\npayments to Blackstone over the life of the arrangement is based on the estimated global net sales of Leqvio. The Company\nrecorded a liability related to the sale of future royalties of $1.38 billion as of December 31, 2023 and recognized interest\nexpenseontheliabilityrelatedtothesaleoffutureroyaltiesof$106.6millionfortheyearendedDecember31,2023.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the liability related to the sale of\nfuture royalties and commercial milestones is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when\ndevelopingtheestimateofthetimingandamountoffutureroyaltiesandcommercialmilestonestobepaid.Thisinturnledtoa\nhighdegreeofauditorjudgmentandeffortinperformingproceduresandinevaluatingauditevidencerelatingtomanagement’s\nestimate of the expected future royalties and commercial milestones to be paid and the selection of third party data used to\nestimateglobalnetsalesofLeqvio.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinionontheconsolidatedfinancialstatements.Theseproceduresincludedtestingtheeffectivenessofcontrolsrelatingtothe\nliability for future royalties and commercial milestones, including controls over management’s process for developing the\nestimateoftimingandamountoffutureroyaltiesandcommercialmilestonestobepaid.Theseproceduresalsoincluded,among\nothers (i) testing management’s process for developing the estimate of timing and amount of future royalties and commercial\nmilestones to be paid and (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management when developing\ntheestimateofexpectedfutureroyaltiesandcommercialmilestonestobepaidrelatedtotheselectionofthirdpartydatausedto\nestimate global net sales of Leqvio.
