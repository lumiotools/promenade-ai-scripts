Words like “believe,” “expect,” and “anticipate”\nmean that these are our best estimates as of this writing, but there can be no assurances that\nexpected or anticipated results or events will actually take place, so our actual future results could\ndiffer significantly from those statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences\ninclude, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully integrate the Pro-ficiency business with\nour own, as well as expenses we may incur in connection therewith, our ability to maintain our\ncompetitive advantages, acceptance of new software and improved versions of our existing\nsoftware by our customers, the general economics of the pharmaceutical industry, our ability to\nfinance growth, our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified technical staff, market\nconditions, macroeconomic factors, and a sustainable market.

These are international and\nlocal laws that prohibit bribery and corruption, and commonly require an organization to\nhave an adequate system of internal financial controls, and to keep accurate and\ndetailed books and records, to guard against bribery and corruption. Examples of such\nlaws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Violation of\nthese laws may give rise to criminal offenses punishable by fines and imprisonment,\nand may include individual liability for those participating in or condoning such\nviolations. Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws are strict when dealing with\ngovernment officials.\nA government official is any:\nIndividual elected or appointed to a\ngovernmental entity,\nOfficial or employee of a government,\nOfficial or employee of a company wholly or\npartially controlled by a government (such\nas state owned companies),\nCandidate for political office,\nPolitical party or official of a political party,\nor\nPerson acting in an official capacity for any\nof the above regardless of rank or position.\nReasonable corporate hospitality that is\nacceptable with other business associates\nmight not be allowable when government\nofficials are involved.\nCode of Conduct 09\n6. Anti-Bribery and\nAnti-Corruption Commitment (cont.)\nThus, a bribe to a government official is interpreted broadly and can occur even when\nthe benefit being offered is small, such as gifts, entertainment, and even business\nmeals. Also, facilitation payments to government officials are prohibited. Facilitation\npayments are payments that facilitate a normal governmental function, such as to\nexpedite processing paperwork.\nIf offered a bribe from a person or entity doing business with or seeking to do business\nwith Simulations Plus, report it immediately to your manager and Simulations Plus\nLegal. We must clearly convey to third parties working with Simulations Plus that we\nexpect them to comply with Anti-bribery and Anticorruption Laws. Employees should\nseek clarification with Simulations Plus management and Legal on any questions or\nconcerns regarding activities with or payments which could appear or could be\nconstrued to be an offer of something of value to gain an improper advantage for the\nbusiness of Simulations Plus or our customers. Violations or suspected violations of\nAnti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws in related to the business of Simulations Plus or\nour business with customers are to be reported to Simulations Plus Legal and/or\nSimulation Plus’s confidential whistleblower hotline (available at +1-661-383-0940).\n7. Fraud, Dishonesty,\nCriminal Conduct\nOur commitment to integrity begins with complying with laws, rules and regulations\napplicable to our business. If we are unsure of whether a contemplated action is\npermitted by law or Simulations Plus policy, we should seek the advice from\nSimulations Plus Management and/or Legal. We are responsible for preventing\nviolations of applicable law and for speaking up if we see possible violations.\nSimulations Plus values ethics and integrity in its operations and business transactions\nand, thus, does not tolerate fraud, dishonesty, or criminal conduct.\nWe expect our employees, customers and vendors to act ethically and honestly in all\nactivities for or on behalf of Simulations Plus. Simulations Plus prohibits fraud or\ndishonesty in connection with Simulations Plus business or while performing work for\nSimulations Plus, including taking unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation,\nconcealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or\nany other unfair dealing practice, or criminal conduct.\nCode of Conduct 10\n7.

Any use of fraudulent or illegal tactics violates the\nresponsibilities entrusted in our employees, and carries potentially severe\nconsequences, including discipline by Simulations Plus and/or prosecution under\napplicable laws.\n8.

Responsible Use of Company\nAssets and Resources\nSimulations Plus has devoted significant time and\nresources in developing our technology (e.g.,\nsoftware platforms, models, simulations,\ndatabases, processes, code, etc.) and related\nintellectual property. Use of any of these assets\nfor individual profit or any unlawful, unauthorized,\nor unethical purpose is prohibited. Such assets\nmay be used for Simulations Plus’s business\npurposes only, and be protected from potential\ndestruction, theft, or misuse using the appropriate\nphysical, technical and organizational security\nmeasures.\nCode of Conduct 12\n9. Responsible Use of\nCompany Assets and Resources (cont.)\nCompany resources such as computers, printers, and copiers, are provided for\nCompany business use. Nonetheless, occasional personal use is permissible as long as\nit does not violate specific policies of Simulations Plus, affect job performance or cause\na disruption to the workplace. Employees and those who represent Simulations Plus are\ntrusted to behave responsibly and use good judgment to conserve and protect\nCompany resources. Managers are responsible for such resources assigned to their\ndepartments and are empowered to resolve issues concerning their proper use.\n10. Personal\nData Privacy\nIn our business transactions with customers, and in our business operations, we are\nprovided access to personal information. We are committed to using personal\ninformation in an ethical, lawful, fair, and legitimate manner, and to respect the privacy\nof individuals whose personal information is entrusted to us. Any information related to\nan identified or identifiable person must be collected and processed in compliance with\napplicable personal data privacy laws.\nOur employees are trained to apply the personal data privacy principles of processing\npersonal information, including fair and lawful processing; processing for the purpose\nfor which the personal information was received or collected; and minimizing personal\ninformation collected for a specific purpose (“business purpose”) for use and storage\nonly to the extent necessary to accomplish the business purpose. Simulations Plus is\ncommitted to protect such personal information by implementing adequate technical\nand organizational measures, and by making all employees, agents, consultants,\nsuppliers, and contractors aware of their responsibility for proper use of personal\ninformation. Simulations Plus has a Data Protection Officer, a Personal Data Privacy\nCoordinator, and policies to ensure and support the integrity, privacy, protection and\nappropriate use of personal information.\nCode of Conduct 13\n11. Securities\nTransactions\nBecause Simulations Plus is a publicly listed company, trading Simulations Plus\nsecurities is governed by securities laws. In interacting with Simulations Plus,\nemployees, customers, and vendors may become aware of material non-public\ninformation about Simulations Plus (e.g., information about us that is not in the public\ndomain, and that an investor would find useful to decide whether to trade in securities\nof Simulation Plus). Some examples of such information include financial results,\nmergers or acquisitions, business expansion, or changes in key personnel of\nSimulations Plus.

Simulations Plus has an\nInsider Trading Policy providing more details on trading shares of Simulations Plus.\n12. International Trade Laws -\nExport Control\nCountries often have laws for controlling into which countries may be exported certain\nitems or data (“export control laws”). Under these laws, an ‘export’ occurs when a\nproduct, service, software, or technical knowledge is transferred from one country to\nanother country or to any citizen or representative of another country. An export can\nalso occur, for example, when a foreign citizen is given access to controlled information\nor software through a network. Simulations Plus’s products and services may be\nsubject to export control laws such as those maintained by the United States. In\nengaging customers or potential customers from countries outside of the United States,\nemployees should carefully consider the obligations of Simulations Plus and the\ncustomer with respect to export controls. There are certain countries sanctioned by the\nUS government (“sanctioned countries”), meaning that the US government prohibits\ntransfer of or access to our software to such sanctioned countries. Contact Simulations\nPlus Legal for more information on export controls applicable to our software.\nCode of Conduct 14\n13.
