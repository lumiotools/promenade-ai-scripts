Whether you are a seasoned security expert or\nsomeone with limited technical experience, the Command Hub's intuitive design makes it easy for any level of\nexpertise to navigate and leverage its powerful features, making it an ideal tool for both day-to-day operations and\nadvanced threat-hunting. The Command Hub o\u0000ers a high level of visibility and control over network activities,\nensuring administrators can monitor critical security metrics across multiple devices from a single interface.\nThe shining star of the Command Hub is its AI Insights engine. This feature provides meaningful, data-driven\ninsights by analyzing vast quantities of network activity. It identi\u0000es potential risks, unusual behavior, and areas that\nrequire attention, o\u0000ering actionable steps that administrators can take to improve their network's security\nposture. The AI engine also o\u0000ers multiple layers of abstraction, allowing visibility from individual device activity all\nthe way up to customer-wide summaries, making it that much more e\u0000ective for \u0000eet management. In addition, it\nprovides visual representations of the data, making it easier to interpret and act upon critical security insights.\n\"The future of cybersecurity relies on harnessing the power of AI-driven insights,\" said Tony Scott, CEO of Intrusion.\n1\n\"With Intrusion Shield Command Hub, we're delivering on that promise by providing administrators with\nmeaningful, data-driven insights to strengthen their network security posture.\"\nOther features such as near real-time reporting on killed threats (both inbound and outbound), geographic threat\nmapping, and high-risk category analysis, the Command Hub allows administrators to quickly assess the security\nstatus of their network. This is further complemented by top-requested domain tracking and detailed views of\ndevices that may be at risk due to suspicious activity.\nThe Command Hub presents critical data in a visually intuitive way. Network data is displayed through interactive\nmaps, graphs, and charts, which help to contextualize information like connection volumes, risk levels, and tra\u0000c\ndirection. This data can be \u0000ltered and customized by time intervals, device types, or speci\u0000c users, providing\n\u0000exibility to security teams that need to manage complex networks. Additionally, the Command Hub o\u0000ers\nadvanced reporting tools to analyze network tra\u0000c across di\u0000erent regions, giving administrators insights into both\ninbound and outbound tra\u0000c sources.\nAbout Intrusion Inc.\nIntrusion Inc. is a cybersecurity company based in Plano, Texas.

We're encouraged by the strong momentum we are seeing for our Shield technology, and we anticipate\nthis growth will help further improve our \u0000nancial results in both the fourth quarter and in 2025.\"\n1\nThird Quarter Financial Results\nRevenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.5 million, an increase of 3% on a sequential basis.

Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Item 10-01 of\nRegulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. All adjustments that,\nin the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the interim periods have been made and are of a recurring\nnature unless otherwise disclosed herein. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full\nyear. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”) on April 1, 2024. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments and includes this additional information in the\nnotes to condensed consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different from the carrying value of these financial instruments. The estimated fair\nvalue of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these\ninstruments. Notes payable and financing and operating leases approximate fair value as they bear market rates of interest. None of these instruments are held\nfor trading purposes.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 million and a working capital deficit of $1.0 million. In addition, the Company has incurred net operating\nlosses during the last four years. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the\ndate of these financial statements. The Company’s principal source of funding operations in 2024 has been proceeds received from the issuance of common\nstock in a series of transactions which include $4.8 million from ATM sales, $2.6 million from a private placement, and $0.6 million from the exercise of\nwarrants. Management plans to continue to fund the operations of the Company through the issuance of common stock using a combination of ATM and equity\nfinancings. If the Company is not able to raise adequate funds under the Company’s ATM program or obtain additional equity financing, the Company may be\nunable to implement the Company’s business plan, fund its liquidity needs or even continue its operations. The financial statements do not include any\nadjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going\nconcern.\nThe audit opinion that accompanied the Company’s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, was qualified in that the\nCompany’s auditors expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\n8\nReverse Stock Split\nThe Company effected a reverse stock split of 1-for-20 on March 22, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all share and per share amounts for all periods\npresented have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.\n3. Right-of-use Asset and Leasing Liabilities\nThe Company has operating and finance leases where it records the right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and related lease liabilities as required under the\nFinancial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842. The lease liabilities are determined by the net present\nvalue of total lease payments and amortized over the life of the lease. The Company’s leases are for the following types of assets:\n· Computer hardware and copy machines- The Company’s finance lease ROU assets consist of computer hardware and copy machines. These leases\nhave a three-year life and are near completion.\n· Office space - The Company’s operating lease ROU assets include its rental agreements for its offices in Plano, TX, and a data service center in\nAllen, TX. In October 2023, the Company signed a new lease with a remaining term of ten years and ten months and commenced upon completion\nof tenant improvements in April 2024. The data service center operating lease liability has a remaining life of one year as of September 30, 2024.\nIn accordance with ASC 842, the Company has elected practical expedients to combine lease and non-lease components, which consist principally of\ncommon area maintenance charges, for all classes of underlying assets and to exclude leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.\nAs the implicit rate is not readily determinable for the Company's lease agreements, the Company uses an estimated incremental borrowing rate to\ndetermine the initial present value of lease payments. This discount rate for the leases approximates the federal reserve’s prime rate.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in lease payments related to\noperating leases and had $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in lease payments related to financing leases.\nSchedule of Items Appearing on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating expense:\nAmortization expense – Finance ROU $ 172 $ 166 $ 501 $ 499\nLease expense – Operating ROU $ 101 $ 112 $ 302 $ 268\nOther expense:\nInterest expense – Finance ROU $ – $ 2 $ – $ 13\n9\nFuture minimum lease obligations consisted of the following as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nOperating Finance\nYear ending December 31, ROU Leases ROU Leases Total\nRemaining 2024 $ 118 $ 258 $ 376\n2025 256 3 259\n2026 196 – 196\n2027 165 – 165\n2028 223 – 223\nThereafter 1,517 – 1,517\n$ 2,475 $ 261 $ 2,736\nLess Interest* (849) –\n$ 1,626 $ 261\n* Interest is imputed for operating ROU leases and classified as lease expense and is included in operating expenses in the accompanying unaudited\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations.\n4. Notes Payable\nStreeterville Security Purchase Agreement\nOn March 10, 2022, Intrusion Inc. entered into an unsecured loan agreement (“SPA”) with Streeterville Capital, LLC (“Streeterville”) whereby the\nCompany issued two separate promissory notes of $5.4 million each with an initial rate of 7%. On March 10, 2022, the Company received $4.6 million in net\nfunds from the first tranche (Note 1) pursuant to a promissory note executed contemporaneously with the execution of the loan agreement. On June 29, 2022,\nthe Company received an additional $4.7 million in net funds from the second tranche (Note 2) pursuant to a promissory note. Each note has an 18-month\nmaturity, may be prepaid subject to varying prepayment premiums, and may be redeemed at any time after six months into the term of such note in amounts up\nto $0.5 million per calendar month upon the noteholder’s election. On January 11, 2023, the Company amended the promissory notes issued pursuant to the\nunsecured loan agreement with Streeterville whereby the noteholder agreed to waive their redemption rights through March 31, 2023, in exchange for a fee\nequal to 3.75% of the outstanding principal balance which increased the outstanding indebtedness due at maturity with Streeterville and increased the\nassociated debt issuance costs recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets by $0.4 million. On August 2, 2023, the Company entered into a\nForbearance Agreement with Streeterville which was subsequently amended on August 7, 2023. The Forbearance Agreement and amendment extended the\nmaturity dates for each Note by twelve months to September 2024 and December 2024. In consideration of the extension of the maturity dates, the Company\nentered into a Security Agreement with Streeterville, dated August 2, 2023 (the “Security Agreement”), under which Streeterville was granted a first-position\nsecurity interest in all assets of the Company.\nIn March 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Streeterville to exchange $0.2 million in principal for 52.2 thousand shares of common\nstock. Also in March 2024, the Company exchanged $9.3 million in Streeterville debt for 9.3 thousand shares of newly created Series A Preferred. The issuance\nof both common and preferred shares was made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements afforded by the Securities Act, as amended. The\ndesignations for the Series A Preferred preclude the Company from repaying any indebtedness for so long as any Series A Preferred shares are outstanding. The\nSeries A Preferred have a stated value of $1,100 per share and are subject to preferences and designations as more fully described in our Amended and Restated\nArticles of Incorporation filed on March 15, 2024, see also Note 6 Stockholders’ Equity. Following the exchanges noted herein, the remaining balance on Note\nOne was $0.5 million. The maturity date for Note One was September 10, 2024, which conflicts with the Series A Preferred designation prohibiting repayment\nof any indebtedness. Note One is pending an amendment to extend the maturity date.\nAs a result of exchanging $9.5 million principal in aggregate for equity, the Company reversed the interest accretion associated with the ability to\nstock-settle principal redemptions and wrote off the balance of unamortized debt issuance costs of $1.0 million in March 2024. Simple interest of $12 thousand\n$274 thousand was incurred for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.\n10\nStreeterville Notes Payable\nOn September 30, 2024, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with Streeterville where Streeterville purchased a note payable in the\nprincipal amount of $0.6 million in exchange for $0.5 million in cash after redemption of $0.1 million of Series A preferred stock. The note called for weekly\npayments of $25 thousand until the maturity on November 18, 2024. In the event the note is not repaid on the maturity date weekly payments increase to $50\nthousand. The note bears no interest.\nScott Notes Payable\nDuring the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company entered into two separate note purchase agreements with the Company’s Chief Executive\nOfficer, Anthony Scott. On January 2, 2024, Scott purchased a note payable in the principal amount of $1.1 million in exchange for $1.0 million in cash. The\nnote called for weekly payments of $40 thousand until maturity on June 15, 2024. Interest accrued on the balance of the note at 7% per annum compounding\ndaily. During the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company made $0.2 million in principal payments on the first note payable.\nOn March 20, 2024, Scott purchased a second note payable in the principal amount of $343 thousand in exchange for $340 thousand in cash. The note\nwas non-interest bearing and matured on April 19, 2024. On April 2, 2024, the Company reduced the principal balance due under the note by $101 thousand\nwhich reflected the amount due from Scott for the exercise of common stock purchase warrants.\nOn April 19, 2024, Scott entered into a private placement subscription agreement to convert the aggregate outstanding balance of $1.1 million for both\nnotes in exchange for common stock and common stock purchase warrants.\nThe Company recorded no interest expense for both notes in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months\nended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, $83 thousand in amortization of debt issuance cost was recorded.\n5. Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is periodically involved in various litigation claims asserted in the normal course of its business. The Company believes these actions are\nroutine and incidental to the business. While the outcome of these actions cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that any will have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company’s business.\nStockholder Derivative Claim\nOn June 3, 2022, a verified stockholder derivative complaint was filed in U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (the “Court”) by the Plaintiff\nStockholder on behalf of Intrusion against certain of the Company’s Defendants. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants through various actions breached their\nfiduciary duties, wasted corporate assets, and unjustly enriched Defendants by (a) incurring costs and expenses in connection with the ongoing SEC\ninvestigation, (b) incurring costs and expenses to defend the Company with respect to the consolidated class action, (c) settling class-wide liability with respect\nto the consolidated class action, as well as ancillary claims regarding sales of the Company’s common stock by certain of the Defendants. On September 28,\n2023, the Company agreed to settle the claim. On October 2, 2023, public notice of the settlement was given. The settlement agreement provides in part for (i)\nan amendment to the Company’s Bylaws, committee Charters, and other applicable corporate policies to implement certain measures set forth more fully\ntherein, to remain in effect for no less than three years; (ii) attorneys’ fees and expenses to plaintiff’s counsel of $0.3 million; and (iii) the dismissal of all\nclaims against the Defendants, including the Company, in connection with the action. The $0.3 million settlement payment was made by the Company’s\ninsurance provider under its insurance policy since the Company’s $0.5 million retention was previously exhausted. On April 3, 2024, the Court approved the\nsettlement.\nIn addition to these legal proceedings, the Company is subject to various other claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company\ndoes not believe that any claims exist where the outcome of such matters would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated\nfinancial position, operating results, or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance such legal proceedings will not have a material impact on the\nCompany’s future results.\n11\n6. Stockholder’s Equity\nStandby Equity Purchase Agreement\nOn July 3, 2024, the Company entered into a $10 million Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (“SEPA”) with Streeterville pursuant to which the\nCompany has the right to direct Streeterville during the 24 month term of the agreement to purchase common stock subject to certain limitations and conditions\nset forth in the SEPA.\nThe shares of common stock purchased pursuant to SEPA will be at a purchase price equal to 95% of the lowest daily VWAP of the shares of Common\nStock during the three consecutive trading days commencing on the date of the delivery of an advance notice. “VWAP” is defined as the daily volume weighted\naverage price of the shares of Common Stock for such trading day on the Nasdaq Stock Market during regular trading hours as reported by Bloomberg L.P. The\nCompany will use 10% of the proceeds associated with each Advance to redeem the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock held by Streeterville.\nUpon execution of the SEPA, the Company issued 93 thousand shares of common stock for payment of the commitment fee equal to 1% of the $10\nmillion commitment and Streeterville purchased 217 thousand shares for a purchase price of $0.01 per common share (“pre-delivery shares”). Following\ntermination of the SEPA Streeterville will deliver to the Company the same amount of pre delivery shares and the Company will pay $0.01 per pre delivery\nshare.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, pursuant to the SEPA, Streeterville purchased 150,000 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate\npurchase price of $131,460.\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nOn March 15, 2024, the Company filed a certificate of designation of preferences and rights (the “Certificate of Designation”) of Series A Preferred\nStock (the “Series A Stock”), with the Secretary of State of Delaware, designating 20,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 of the Company, as Series\nA Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Stock shall have a stated face value of $1,100.00 (“Stated Value”). The Series A Stock is not convertible into\ncommon shares of the capital stock of the Company and as such is non-dilutive to current stockholders.\nEach share of Series A Stock shall accrue a rate of return on the Stated Value at the rate of 10% per year, compounded annually from the date of\nissuance and payable quarterly in cash or the issuance of additional shares of Series A Stock.\nCommencing on the one-year anniversary of the issuance date of each share of Series A Stock to the two-year anniversary, each share of Series A\nStock shall accrue an automatic quarterly dividend, calculated on the Stated Value at a rate of 2.5% per quarter. For all periods following the two-year\nanniversary of the issuance date of each share of Series A Stock, the quarterly dividend shall be 5%. The quarterly dividend shall be payable quarterly in cash\nor the issuance of additional shares of Series A Stock. In the event the Company is unable to pay the Quarterly Dividend of Preferred Return in cash and no\nremaining shares of Series A Stock are available for issuance, the Quarterly Dividend and Preferred Return will continue to accrue until such time the Company\ncan make payment. The Company classified the Series A Preferred Stock as equity as all events that could trigger redemption are fully within the Company’s\ncontrol.\nOn March 15, 2024, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with Streeterville Capital that exchanged $9.3 million in debt for 9,275 shares\nof newly created Series A Preferred Stock.\nOn April 3, 2024, the Company exchanged 91 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for 32,248 shares of our common stock. On May 10, 2024, the\nCompany exchanged 125 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for 90,460 shares of our common stock. On May 30, 2024, the Company exchanged 339 shares of\nSeries A Preferred Stock for 243,725 shares of our common stock. On August 22, 2024, the Company exchanged 130 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for\n110,852 shares of our common stock. All of these exchanges were made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements afforded by Section 3(a)\n(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\n12\nOn September 18, 2024, the Company redeemed 11 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in conjunction with the sale of Common Stock under the SEPA.\nAlso, during the quarter ended September 2024, the Company redeemed 90 shares of Series A Preferred Stock.\nThrough September 30, 2024, the Company has paid a preferred return of $0.5 million through the issuance of 489 additional shares of Series A\nPreferred Stock.\nPrivate Offering\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company sold to certain purchasers 1,348,569 shares of the Company’s common stock together with accompanying common\nstock purchase warrants to purchase 2,697,138 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $1.95 per share (or common stock equivalent) and two\naccompanying Common Stock Purchase Warrants, for net proceeds of approximately $2.6 million. The Common Stock Purchase Warrants will be exercisable\nat any time following the date of issuance, expire five years following the date of issuance, and have an exercise price of $1.70 per share. None of the shares of\nCommon Stock and shares underlying the Common Stock Purchase Warrants have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and do not\ncarry registration rights.\nATM Offering\nB. Riley Securities, Inc. acts as sales agent for the Company’s ATM program, which allows the Company to potentially sell up to $50.0 million of the\nCompany’s common stock using a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed on August 5, 2021. On March 31, 2023, the date the Company filed its Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company became subject to the offering limits in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-\n3. As a result, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus relating to the registration of offerings under the program that reduced the amount\nthe Company may sell to aggregate proceeds of up to $15 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received proceeds of\napproximately $4.8 million net of fees from the sale of common stock pursuant to the program. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has received proceeds\nof approximately $17.0 million net of fees from the sales of 3.5 million shares of common stock since the inception of the program.\nCommon Stock Warrants\nOn April 1, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved entry into a warrant inducement offering that provided, during the period beginning on\nApril 2, 2024 and continuing through April 23, 2024, for the lowering of the exercise price of all outstanding warrants and, for each share of common stock\nexercised under the warrants, providing the participating warrant holder with a new warrant for that same number of shares of common stock. The reduced\nexercise price of the warrants was $3.04. The new warrant exercise price is $2.91 with an exercise period of five years. On April 8, 2024, certain holders of the\nwarrants exercised 186 thousand shares of the Company’s common stock resulting in gross proceeds of $0.6 million and the issuance of 186 thousand new\nwarrants. The issuance of the new Warrants was undertaken pursuant to the exemption from registration provided in Rule 506(b) under Regulation D pursuant\nto the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nOn September 30, 2024, the Company had 52,471 warrants to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $104.40, 257,604 warrants\nto purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $12.00, 186,492 warrants to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $2.91,\nand 2,697,138 warrants to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $1.70.\n13\n7. Revenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes product revenue upon shipment or after meeting certain performance obligations. These products can include hardware,\nsoftware subscriptions and consulting services. The Company also offers software on a subscription basis subject to software as a service (“SaaS”). Warranty\ncosts have not been material.\nThe Company recognizes sales of the Company’s datasets in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 606 whereby revenue from contracts with customers\nare recognized once the criteria under the five steps below have been met:\ni) identification of the contract with a customer;\nii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\niii) determination of the transaction price;\niv) allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance obligations; and\nv) recognize revenue upon satisfaction of a performance obligation.\nConsulting services include reporting and are typically done monthly, and revenue is matched accordingly. Product sales may include maintenance and\ncustomer support allocated revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy\nusing the relative selling price method. All product offering and service offering market values are readily determined based on current and prior stand-alone\nsales. The Company defers and recognizes maintenance, updates, and support revenue over the term of the contract period, which is generally one year.\nNormal payment terms offered to customers, distributors and resellers are net 30 days domestically. The Company does not offer payment terms that\nextend beyond one year and rarely does it extend payment terms beyond its normal terms. If certain customers do not meet its credit standards, the Company\ntypically requires payment in advance to limit its credit exposure.\nWith the Company’s newest product, INTRUSION Shield, the Company began offering software on a subscription basis. INTRUSION Shield is a\nhosted arrangement subject to SaaS guidance under ASC 606. SaaS arrangements are accounted for as subscription services, not arrangements that transfer a\nlicense of intellectual property.\nThe Company utilizes the five-step process, mentioned above, per FASB ASC Topic 606 to recognize sales and will follow that directive, also, to\ndefine revenue items as individual and distinct. INTRUSION Shield services provided to its customers for a fixed monthly subscription fee include:\n· access to Intrusion’s proprietary software and database to detect and prevent unauthorized access to its clients’ information networks;\n· use of all software, associated media, printed materials, data, files, online documentation, and any equipment that Intrusion provides for customers\nto access the INTRUSION Shield; and\n· tech support, post contract customer support (PCS) includes daily program releases or corrections provided by Intrusion without additional charge.\n14\nINTRUSION Shield contracts provide for no other services, and the Company’s customers have no rebates or return rights, nor are any such rights\nanticipated to be offered as part of this service.\nThe Company satisfies its performance obligation when the INTRUSION Shield solution is available to detect and prevent unauthorized access to a\nclient’s information networks. Revenue should be recognized monthly over the term of the contract. The Company’s standard initial contract terms\nautomatically renew unless notice is given 30 days before renewal. Upfront payment of fees is deferred and amortized into income over the period covered by\nthe contract.\nThe Company’s accounts receivable represents unconditional contract billings for sales per contracts with customers and are classified as current\nassets. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had accounts receivable balances of $0.9 million and $0.4 million, respectively. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had an allowance for credit losses of $0.1 million.\nThe Company classifies its contract assets as receivables because the Company generally has an unconditional right to payment for the Company’s\nsales or services performed at the end of the reporting period.\nContract liabilities consist of cash payments in advance of the Company satisfying performance obligations and recognizing revenue. The Company\ncurrently classifies deferred revenue as a contract liability.\nThe following table presents changes in the Company’s contract liability during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nBalance at beginning of period $ 439 $ 455\nAdditions 1,876 4,727\nRevenue recognized (2,017) (4,743)\nBalance at end of period $ 298 $ 439\n8. Capitalized Software Development\nThe Company capitalizes internally developed software using the Agile software development methodology which allows the Company to accurately\ntrack, and record costs associated with new software development and enhancements.\nPursuant to ASC Topic 350-40 Internal Use Software Accounting Capitalization, certain development costs related to the Company’s products during\nthe application development stage are capitalized as part of property and equipment. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as\nincurred. The preliminary stage includes such activities as conceptual formulation of alternatives, evaluation of alternatives, determination of existence of\nneeded technology, and the final selection of alternatives. Once the application development stage is reached, internal and external costs are capitalized until\nthe software is complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized internal use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life,\nwhich is generally three years.\n15\n9. Net Loss Per Share\nThe Company reports two separate net loss per share numbers, basic and diluted. Basic net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is\ncomputed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the\nperiod. Diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the period\nby the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. The common stock equivalents include\nall common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants, options and vesting of restricted stock awards. The aggregate number of common stock\nequivalents excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 totaled 3,334 thousand and 123\nthousand shares, respectively. The aggregate number of common stock equivalents excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, and 2023 totaled 2,078 thousand and 117 thousand shares, respectively. Since the Company is in a net loss position for the periods\nended September 30, 2024, and 2023, basic and dilutive net loss per share is the same.\n10. Related Party Transactions\nOn January 2, 2024, the Company entered into an invoice financing arrangement pursuant to a note purchase agreement with Anthony Scott, President,\nand Chief Executive Officer of the Company (“Scott”), according to which, among other things, Scott purchased from the Company a promissory note (the\n“Promissory Note”) in the aggregate principal amount of $1.1 million in exchange for $1.0 million to the Company. Under the Promissory Note, the Company\nshall make Weekly Payments to Scott in the amount of $40 thousand per week. Interest accrues on the balance of the Promissory Note at a rate of 7.0% per\nannum, compounded daily. In connection with the issuance of the Promissory Note, the Company and Scott also entered into a security agreement, which\nprovides, according to its terms, a security interest in all accounts receivable or other receivables now existing or subsequently created prior to the payment of\nthe Promissory Note, subject to prior permitted liens. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made $0.0 and $0.2\nmillion in principal payments on the Promissory Note.\nOn March 20, 2024, the Company entered into an additional invoice financing arrangement pursuant to a note purchase agreement with Scott,\naccording to which, among other things, Scott purchased from the Company a second Promissory Note 2 in the aggregate principal amount of $343 thousand in\nexchange for $340 thousand to the Company. The Promissory Note 2 is non-interest bearing and matures on April 19, 2024.\nOn April 2, 2024, the Company reduced the principal balance due under the Promissory Note by $0.1 million which reflected the amount due from\nScott for the exercise of common stock purchase warrants.\nOn April 19, 2024, Scott entered into a private placement subscription agreement to convert the aggregate outstanding balance of $1.1 million for both\nnotes in exchange for common stock and common stock purchase warrants.\nThe Company recorded interest expense of $0 and $20 thousand for both notes in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations\nfor the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, $0 and $83\nthousand in amortization of debt issuance cost was recorded, respectively.\n11. Subsequent Events\nOn October 28, 2024, the Company received a written notice (the “Bid Price Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications department (the “Nasdaq\nStaff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth in\nNasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The notification of\nnoncompliance has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company’s common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “INTZ,”\nand the Company is currently monitoring the closing bid price of its common stock and evaluating its alternatives, if appropriate, to resolve the deficiency\nand regain compliance with this rule.\n16\nItem 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including, without limitation, the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations,” contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities\nAct\"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties.\nAll statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our financial position;\nour ability to continue our business as a going concern; our business, sales, and marketing strategies and plans; our ability to successfully market, sell, and\ndeliver our INTRUSION Shield commercial product and solutions to an expanding customer base; and our ability to secure additional financing; are forward-\nlooking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,”\n“continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” or “would” or the negative of\nthese words or other similar terms or expressions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to,\nsuch statements.\nYou should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and operating results. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other\nfactors described in the section titled “Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as the same may\nbe amended or updated from time to time.\nIn addition, statements such as \"we believe\" and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based\non information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While we believe that such information provides a reasonable basis for\nthese statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements do not indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review\nof, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements.\nThe forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We\nundertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date\nof this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.\nOverview\nIntrusion offers businesses of all sizes and industries products and services that leverage the Company’s exclusive threat intelligence database of over\n8.5 billion IP addresses and domain names. After many years of gathering intelligence and providing our INTRUSION TraceCop and Savant solutions\nexclusively to government entities, we released our first commercial product in 2021, the INTRUSION Shield. INTRUSION Shield was designed to allow\nbusinesses to incorporate a Zero Trust, reputation-based security solution into their existing infrastructure to observe traffic flow and instantly block known\nmalicious or unknown connections from both entering or exiting a network, making it an ideal solution for protecting from Zero-Day and ransomware attacks.\nAs discussed in more detail below on September 30, 2024, we had $1.1 million in cash. If we are not able to raise adequate funds under the Company’s\nATM program or obtain additional equity financing, the Company may be unable to implement the Company’s business plan, fund its liquidity needs or even\ncontinue its operations.\n17\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nRevenue $ 1,504 $ 1,468 $ 36 2% $ 4,095 $ 4,245 $ (150) -4%\nCost of revenue 344 324 20 6% 920 967 (47) -5%\nGross profit 1,160 1,144 16 1% 3,175 3,278 (103) -3%\n77.1% 77.9% 77.5% 77.2%\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 1,207 1,357 (150) -11% 3,542 4,518 (976) -22%\nResearch and development 1,150 1,171 (21) -2% 3,204 4,418 (1,214) -27%\nGeneral and administrative 841 1,309 (468) -36% 2,972 4,000 (1,028) -26%\nTotal operating expenses 3,198 3,837 (639) -17% 9,718 12,936 (3,218) -25%\nOperating loss (2,038) (2,693) 655 24% (6,543) (9,658) 3,115 32%\nInterest expense (12) (211) 199 -94% (274) (729) 455 -62%\nInterest accretion and amortization of debt issuance\ncosts, net – (309) 309 -100% 990 (730) 1,720 -236%\nOther income (expense), net – 2 (2) 100% (6) 43 (49) 114%\nNet loss $ (2,050) $ (3,211) $ 1,161 36% $ (5,833) $ (11,074) $ 5,241 47%\nRevenues. Revenue for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, was $1.5 and $4.1 million compared to $1.5 and $4.2 million for\nthe same periods in 2023. Revenue from consulting totaled $1.1 and $2.9 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n$1.0 and $3.1 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023. The continuing resolution and delay in the approval of a federal budget\nfor the 2024 year which did not occur until March 22, 2024, impacted the timing of renewals and task orders received for long-standing contracts which\nresulted in a decline in consulting revenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. INTRUSION Shield revenues were $0.4 and $1.2 million for\nthe three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, which is flat when compared to the prior year periods but represents a 49% increase over the June\n2024 quarter. Shield revenues for the June 2024 quarter had declined as a result of the loss of a large early INTRUSION Shield customer that had\nimplemented a highly customized and non-standard configuration of the product. The loss of revenues from this customer has been fully offset by revenues\nfrom new customers signed in recent quarters. We believe the revenues from these new customers and several transactions that we anticipate will close in the\nfourth quarter will drive INTRUSION Shield revenue growth into 2025.\nConcentration of Revenues. For the three and nine month periods ended and September 30, 2024, revenues from sales to various U.S. government\nentities totaled $1.3 and $3.3 million, or 86% and 80% of revenues compared to $0.6 and $1.9 million, or 43% and 46% of revenues, for the same periods in\n2023. Although we expect our concentration of revenues to vary among customers in future periods depending upon the timing of certain sales, we anticipate\nthat sales to government customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods. Sales to the government present risks in\naddition to those involved in sales to commercial customers which could adversely affect our revenues, including, without limitation, potential disruption to\nappropriation and spending patterns and the government’s reservation of the right to cancel contracts and purchase orders for its convenience. Although we do\nnot anticipate that any of our revenues from government customers will be renegotiated, any cancelled or renegotiated government orders could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial results. As a result of sales to U.S. government entities representing a higher percentage of our revenues in 2024, no commercial\ncustomer individually represented more than 10% of our total revenues as compared to two commercial customers in the 2023 period. Our similar product and\nservice offerings are not viewed as individual segments, as management analyzes the business as a whole and expenses are not allocated to each product\noffering.\n18\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $1.2 and $3.2 million or 77.1% and 77.5% of revenues for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $1.1 and $3.3 million or 77.9% and 77.2% of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gross profit margin will vary\ndepending on product mix. INTRUSION Shield revenues represent between 27% to 30% of revenues for the three and nine month periods ended September\n30, 2024, and 2023.\nOperating Expenses. Operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $3.2 and $9.7 million, representing a\ndecrease of 17% and 25% when compared to $3.8 and $12.9 million for the same periods in 2023. The decrease was most notably due to a reduction in staffing\nand contract labor expenses in addition to reduced spend on litigation defense costs, sales, and marketing.\nIn late March 2023 we implemented cost reduction measures that resulted in the reduction of sixteen permanent positions, the reduced use of\ncontractors and renegotiating or replacing spend on certain sales support and marketing services with less costly programs. Many of the reductions were in\nResearch and Development, which will impact the number and frequency of product releases. As we grow our customer base and increase our revenues, we\nmay choose to accelerate our product development in future periods, which would result in increased spending. Headcount on September 30, 2024, and 2023\nwas 50 and 49, respectively.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $1.2 and $3.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $1.4 and $4.5 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023. The 2024 nine month period includes approximately $0.2\nmillion in one-time negotiated contract savings. Certain discretionary spend, inclusive of participation in trade shows, utilization of third-party contractors for\ncontent and product messaging and travel, are likely to vary over time based on savings initiatives that may be necessary.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses totaled $1.2 and $3.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, compared to $1.2 and $4.4 million for the same periods in 2023. The savings for the nine month period is a result of cost reduction measures\nimplemented in late March 2023 which included the reduction of 13 FTEs and the reduced use of contractors. Research and development costs may vary over\ntime as we determine the frequency of new releases, improved functionality and enhancements needed to be competitive with our product offering.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses totaled $0.8 and $3.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, compared to $1.3 and $4.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The $1.0 million reduction in the nine month period relates\nto the elimination of two positions, reduced share-based compensation, and one-time negotiated cost savings of $0.2 million.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $12 thousand and $274 thousand consisting\nprincipally of the stated interest related to the Streeterville and Scott notes, and finance leases. Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023, was $211 thousand and $729 thousand. The decreased interest expense resulted principally from the aggregate exchange of the Streeterville debt to\nboth common and preferred stock. On September 30, 2024, only $520 thousand of the Streeterville Note One remains outstanding. Interest expenses will vary\nin the future based on our cash flow and borrowing needs.\nInterest Accretion and Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company entered into exchange\nagreements to convert $9.5 million in Streeterville debt to $9.3 million of Series A preferred stock and $0.2 million to common stock and, as a result, the\nCompany reversed the interest accretion associated with the ability to stock-settle principal redemptions and wrote-off the remaining deferred debt issue costs\nresulting in a net credit to interest expense of $1.0 million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the interest accretion and amortization of\ndebt issuance costs totaled $0.3 and $0.7 million.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net. Other income and expenses were nominal amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023.\n19\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 million and a working capital deficit of $(1.0) million. Management plans to fund\nthe operations of the Company through the continued use of the ATM and or additional equity financings. If the Company is not able to raise adequate funds,\nthe Company may be unable to implement the Company’s business plan, fund its liquidity needs or even continue its operations.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur principal sources of cash for funding operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, has been proceeds received from the issuance of\ncommon stock in a series of transactions which include $4.8 million from ATM sales, $2.6 million from a private placement, and $0.6 million from the exercise\nof warrants. Our principal source of cash for funding operations in 2023 was $3.0 million from sales of common stock utilizing the ATM program and changes\nin working capital which includes the receipt of $1.4 million in Employee Retention Tax Credit refunds recorded in 2022.\nStandby Equity Purchase Agreement\nOn July 3, 2024, we entered into a $10 million Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (“SEPA”) with Streeterville Capital, LLC (“Streeterville”)\npursuant to which the Company has the right to direct Streeterville during the 24 month term of the agreement to purchase common stock subject to certain\nlimitations and conditions set forth in the SEPA.\nThe shares of common stock purchased pursuant to SEPA will be at a purchase price equal to 95% of the lowest daily VWAP of the shares of Common\nStock during the three consecutive trading days commencing on the date of the delivery of an advance notice. “VWAP” is defined as the daily volume weighted\naverage price of the shares of Common Stock for such trading day on the Nasdaq Stock Market during regular trading hours as reported by Bloomberg L.P.\nUnder applicable Nasdaq rules and the terms of the SEPA, in no event may the Company issue to Streeterville under the SEPA shares of Common\nStock equal to greater than 19.99% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the SEPA (the “Exchange Cap”), unless\n(i) the Company obtains stockholder approval to issue shares of Common Stock in excess of the Exchange Cap in accordance with applicable Nasdaq rules, or\n(ii) the average price per share paid by Streeterville for all of the shares of Common Stock that the Company directs Streeterville to purchase from the\nCompany pursuant to the SEPA, if any, equals or exceeds the lower of (a) the official closing price of the Common Stock on Nasdaq immediately preceding the\nexecution of the SEPA or (b) the average official closing price of the Common Stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding\nthe execution of the SEPA, adjusted as required by Nasdaq. Moreover, the Company may not issue or sell any shares of Common Stock to Streeterville under\nthe SEPA which, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by Streeterville and its affiliates (as calculated pursuant to\nSection 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-3 thereunder), would result in Streeterville beneficially owning more than 19.99% of the outstanding shares of\nCommon Stock. At the 2024 annual meeting stockholders approved the sale, issuance or potential issuance by the Company of Common Stock (or securities\nconvertible into or exercisable for our Common Stock) in excess of 20% of the shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the SEPA at an\nexercise price less than the Minimum Price in connection with the SEPA.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we sold 150,000 shares of Common Stock to Streeterville for an aggregate purchase price of $131,460.\nFuture sales of shares of Common Stock to Streeterville as an advance under the SEPA will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company\nfrom time to time, which may include, among other things, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by the Company as\nto the appropriate sources of funding for our business and operations. The Company will use 10% of the proceeds associated with each Advance to redeem the\noutstanding Series A Preferred Stock held by Streeterville.\n20\nAt-The-Market Program\nB. Riley Securities, Inc. acts as sales agent under the Company’s at-the-market program, which allowed us to potentially sell up to $50.0 million of its\ncommon stock using the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed on August 5, 2021. On April 11, 2023, Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 and in agreement\nwith the terms of the sales agreement, the company revised the aggregate offering price of shares of common stock that we can sell pursuant to the ATM\nprogram to $15 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received $4.8 million, net of fees for sales of common stock were made\npursuant to the program. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining aggregate offering price of shares of common stock that we can sell pursuant to the ATM\nprogram based on gross proceeds was $5.2 million.\nNotes Payable\nIn March 2024, we entered into an agreement with Streeterville to exchange $0.2 million in principal for 52.2 thousand shares of common stock. Also\nin March 2024, we exchanged $9.3 million in Streeterville debt for 9,275 shares of our newly created Series A Preferred. The issuance of both common and\npreferred shares was made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements afforded by the Securities Act, as amended. The designations for the\nSeries A Preferred preclude the Company from repaying any indebtedness for so long as any Series A Preferred shares are outstanding. The Series A Preferred\nshares have a stated value of $1,100 per share and are subject to preferences and designations as more fully described in our Amended and Restated Articles of\nIncorporation filed on March 15, 2024. Following the exchanges noted herein, the remaining balance on Note One was $0.5 million on September 30, 2024.\nThe maturity date for Note One is September 2024 which conflicts with the Series A Preferred designation prohibiting repayment of any indebtedness. We are\nin discussions with Streeterville to modify the terms of the Note One agreement.\nOn September 30, 2024, we entered into a note purchase agreement with Streeterville where Streeterville purchased a note payable in the principal\namount of $0.6 million in exchange for $0.5 million in cash after redemption of $0.1 million of Series A preferred stock. The note called for weekly payments\nof $25 thousand until the maturity on November 18, 2024. In the event the note is not repaid on the maturity date weekly payments increase to $50 thousand.\nThe note bears no interest.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we entered into two separate note purchase agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Scott. On\nJanuary 2, 2024, Scott purchased a note payable in the principal amount of $1.1 million in exchange for $1.0 million in cash. The note called for weekly\npayments of $40,000 until maturity on June 15, 2024. Interest accrued on the balance of the note at 7% per annum compounding daily. During the quarter\nended March 31, 2024, we made $200 thousand in principal payments. On March 20, 2024, Scott purchased a second note payable in the principal amount of\n$343 thousand in exchange for $340 thousand in cash. The note was non-interest bearing and matured on April 19, 2024. On April 2, 2024, we reduced the\nprincipal balance due under the note by $101 thousand which reflected the amount due from Scott for the exercise of common stock purchase warrants. On\nApril 19, 2024, Scott entered into a private placement subscription agreement to convert the aggregate remaining outstanding balance of $1.1 million for both\nnotes in exchange for common stock and common stock purchase warrants.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nOur cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 were:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (6,115) $ (4,779)\nNet cash used in investing activities (1,051) (1,041)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 8,078 2,982\nChange in cash and cash equivalents $ 912 $ (2,838)\n21\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was ($6.1) million primarily resulting from 1) a net loss of ($5.8) million\noffset by adjustments for non-cash items of $1.0 million which are mostly comprised of depreciation, stock-based compensation and non-cash interest related\nto the Streeterville notes, and 2) changes in working capital of ($1.3) million resulting principally from increased accounts receivable.\nNet cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was ($4.8) million due primarily to a net loss of ($11.1) million partially\noffset by 1) adjustments for non-cash items of $3.5 million which are mostly comprised of depreciation, stock-based compensation and interest related to\nStreeterville notes, and 2) $2.8 million provided from working capital principally related to Employee Retention Credit and increased accounts payable of $1.0\nmillion.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was ($1.1) million, which was comprised of capitalization of\ninternally developed software and hardware purchases. Net cash used by investing activities, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was ($1.0) million\nprincipally for capitalization of internally developed software.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $8.1 million which resulted from $8.0 million in net\nproceeds from the sale of common stock through the use our ATM program, private placement offering, and the exercise of warrants partially offset by finance\nlease payments. Net proceeds from financing activities of $3.0 million for nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulted principally from sales of common\nstock using our ATM program.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related\ndisclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We\nevaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences\nbetween these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nWe believe the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, reflect our more\nsignificant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes to our\ncritical accounting policies and estimates as filed in such report.\n22\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable.\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive\nofficer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply our reasonable judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of\npotential disclosure controls and procedures.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the\ndesign and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30,\n2024.\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n23\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nStockholder Derivative Claim\nOn June 3, 2022, a stockholder derivative complaint was filed in U.S. District Court, District of Delaware the Court by the Plaintiff Stockholder on\nbehalf of Intrusion against Defendants. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants through various actions breached their fiduciary duties, wasted corporate assets, and\nunjustly enriched Defendants by (a) incurring costs and expenses in connection with the ongoing SEC investigation, (b) incurring costs and expenses to defend\nus with respect to the consolidated class action, (c) settling class-wide liability with respect to the consolidated class action, as well as ancillary claims\nregarding sales of our common stock by certain of the Defendants. On September 28, 2023, we agreed to settle the claim. On October 2, 2023, public notice of\nthe settlement agreement was given. The settlement agreement provides in part for (i) an amendment to our Bylaws, committee Charters, and other applicable\ncorporate policies to implement certain measures set forth more fully therein, to remain in effect for no less than three years; (ii) attorneys’ fees and expenses to\nplaintiff’s counsel of $0.3 million; and (iii) the dismissal of all claims against the Defendants, including the Company, in connection with the action. The $0.3\nmillion settlement payment was made by our insurance provider under our insurance policy since our $0.5 million retention was previously exhausted. On\nApril 3, 2024, the Court approved the settlement.\nIn addition to these legal proceedings, we are subject to various other claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that\nany claims exist where the outcome of such matters would have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial position, operating results, or\ncash flows. However, there can be no assurance such legal proceedings will not have a material impact on our future results.\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the risk factor set forth below, you should carefully\nconsider the risk factors we previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 (the “Annual Report”). These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash\nflows. However, these risks are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial\nalso may impair our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nNasdaq may delist our common stock from trading on its exchange, which could limit stockholders’ ability to trade our common stock.\nOn October 28, 2024, the Company received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications department of Nasdaq Stock Market indicating that the\nCompany is not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on the Nasdaq\nCapital Market.\nIf the Company is not able to resolve the minimum bid price requirement the Company’s stock may be delisted.\n24\nOur stock price is likely to be highly volatile because of several factors, including a limited public float.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile in the\nfuture. You may not be able to resell shares of our common stock following periods of volatility because of the market’s adverse reaction to volatility.\nOther factors that could cause such volatility may include, among other things:\n· actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n· the absence of securities analysts covering us and distributing research and recommendations about us;\n· we may have a low trading volume for a number of reasons, including that a large portion of our stock is closely held;\n· overall stock market fluctuations;\n· announcements concerning our business or those of our competitors;\n· actual or perceived limitations on our ability to raise capital when we require it, and to raise such capital on favorable terms;\n· conditions or trends in the industry;\n· litigation;\n· changes in market valuations of other similar companies;\n· future sales of common stock;\n· departure of key personnel or failure to hire key personnel; and\n· general market conditions.\nAny of these factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general has\nat times experienced extreme volatility and rapid decline that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular\ncompanies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of common stock could cause the market price of our shares of common stock to decline.\nWe have agreed, at our expense, to prepare and file with the SEC certain registration statements providing for the resale of shares of common stock,\nincluding this registration statement. The resale, or expected or potential resale, of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market\ncould adversely affect the market price for our shares of common stock and make it more difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock at times and\nprices that you feel are appropriate. In particular, as a result of the SEPA, Streeterville is an “underwriter” as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(11) of\nSecurities Act, and the SEPA contemplates that Streeterville expects to resell any shares of common stock we may issue and sell pursuant thereto. Furthermore,\nwe expect that, because there will be a large number of shares registered, Streeterville will continue to offer such covered securities for a significant period of\ntime, the precise duration of which cannot be predicted. Accordingly, the adverse market and price pressures resulting from an offering pursuant to a\nregistration statement may continue for an extended period of time.\n25\nThe issuances of additional shares of common stock under the SEPA may result in dilution of holders of common stock and have a negative impact on the\nmarket price of the common stock.\nPursuant to the SEPA, we may issue and sell up to $10 million worth of shares of common stock (“Advance Shares”) to Streeterville. The price at\nwhich we may issue and sell shares is at 95% of the lowest daily VWAP of the common stock during the three trading days following a notice to sell to\nStreeterville. Assuming that (a) we issue and sell the full $10 million worth of shares of common stock under the SEPA to Streeterville, (b) no beneficial\nownership limitations, and (c) the issue price for such sales is $1.08 per share, such additional issuances would represent in the aggregate approximately\n1,195,666 additional shares of common stock or approximately 16.5% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the date hereof, after\ngiving effect to such issuance. In addition, the Company issued 92,592 shares of common stock (the “Streeterville Commitment Shares”) to Streeterville upon\nthe effective date of the SEPA as consideration for its irrevocable commitment to purchase shares of common stock at our direction, from time to time after the\ndate of this prospectus. Furthermore, the Company issued 216,921 shares of common stock (the “Pre-Delivery Shares”) to Streeterville for the purchase price\nof $0.01 per share upon the effective date of the SEPA as further consideration for its irrevocable commitment to purchase shares of common stock at our\ndirection, from time to time after the date of this prospectus. If the beneficial ownership limitation is not waived, we may issue approximately 670,365 shares\nof common stock, or approximately 9.99% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the date hereof, after giving effect to such issuance.\nThe timing, frequency, and the price at which we issue shares of common stock are subject to market prices and management’s decision to sell shares of\ncommon stock, if at all.\nUpon effectiveness of this registration statement, Streeterville may resell all, some or none of their shares of common stock beneficially owned by\nthem from time to time in their discretion and at different prices subject to the terms of the SEPA. As a result, investors will likely pay different prices for those\nshares, and so may experience different levels of dilution (and in some cases substantial dilution) and different outcomes in their investment results. Investors\nmay experience a decline in the value of the shares they purchase as a result of future issuances by the Company, whether to Streeterville or others at prices\nlower than the prices such investors paid for their shares. In addition, if we issue a substantial number of shares to such parties, or if investors expect that we\nwill do so, the actual sales of shares or the mere existence of the SEPA may adversely affect the price of our common stock or make it more difficult for us to\nsell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a desirable time and price, or at all.\nThe issuance, if any, of common stock would not affect the rights or privileges of the Company’s existing stockholders, except that the economic and\nvoting interests of existing stockholders would be diluted. Although the number of shares of common stock that existing stockholders own would not decrease\nas a result of these additional issuances, the shares of common stock owned by existing stockholders would represent a smaller percentage of the total\noutstanding shares of common stock after any such issuance, potentially significantly smaller.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our share price.\nAs of November 14, 2024, we had 8,056,021 shares of our common stock outstanding. Sales of a number of shares of common stock in the public\nmarket or issuances of additional shares pursuant to the exercise of our outstanding warrants, or the expectation of such sales or exercises, could cause the\nmarket price of our common stock to decline. We may also sell additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable\nfor common stock in subsequent public or private offerings or other transactions, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nItem 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nOn August 22, 2024, we agreed to exchange 130 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for 110,852 shares of our common stock.\nThis exchange and sale was made pursuant to an exemption from registration as set forth as set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or\nRule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.\nOn July 10, 2024, we agreed to exchange 123,740 shares of common stock to settle a vendor liability of $0.1 million.\nItem 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\nItem 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\n27\nItem 5. OTHER INFORMATION\n(a) None.\n(b) There have been no material changes to procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to the Company’s Board of Directors\nsince the Company last provided disclosure in response to the requirements of Item 407(c)(3) of Regulation S-K.\n(c) During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer adopted or terminated any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nItem 6.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Description of Business\nIntrusion Inc. (together with its condensed consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Intrusion”, “Intrusion Inc.”, “we”, “us”, “our”, or similar terms)\nwas organized in Texas in September 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in October 1995. Our principal executive offices are located at 101 East Park\nBoulevard, Suite 1200, Plano, Texas 75074, and our telephone number is (972) 234-6400. Our website URL is www.intrusion.com.\nThe Company develops, sells, and supports products that protect any-sized company or government organization by fusing advanced threat intelligence\nwith real-time mitigation to kill cyberattacks as they occur – including Zero-Days. The Company markets and distributes the Company’s solutions through\nvalue-added resellers, managed service providers and a direct sales force. The Company’s end-user customers include United States (“U.S.”) federal\ngovernment entities, state and local government entities, and companies ranging in size from mid-market to large enterprises.\nTraceCop (“TraceCop™”) and Savant (“Savant™”) are registered trademarks of Intrusion Inc. The Company has applied for trademark protection for\nthe Company’s new INTRUSION Shield cybersecurity solution.\n2. Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Item 10-01 of\nRegulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. All adjustments that,\nin the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the interim periods have been made and are of a recurring\nnature unless otherwise disclosed herein. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full\nyear. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”) on April 1, 2024. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments and includes this additional information in the\nnotes to condensed consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different from the carrying value of these financial instruments. The estimated fair\nvalue of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these\ninstruments. Notes payable and financing and operating leases approximate fair value as they bear market rates of interest. None of these instruments are held\nfor trading purposes.\n7\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of June 30, 2024, the\nCompany had cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 million and a working capital deficit of $0.5 million. In addition, the Company has incurred net operating\nlosses during the last four years. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the\ndate of these financial statements. The Company’s principal source of funding operations in 2024 has been proceeds received from the issuance of common\nstock in a series of transactions which include $3.3 million from ATM sales, $2.6 million from a private placement, and $0.6 million from the exercise of\nwarrants. Management plans to continue to fund the operations of the Company through the issuance of common stock using a combination of the ATM and\nequity financings. If the Company is not able to raise adequate funds under the Company’s ATM program or obtain additional equity financing, the Company\nmay be unable to implement the Company’s business plan, fund its liquidity needs or even continue its operations. The financial statements do not include any\nadjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going\nconcern.\nThe audit opinion that accompanied the Company’s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, was qualified in that the\nCompany’s auditors expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nReverse Stock Split\nThe Company effected a reverse stock split of 1-for-20 on March 22, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all share and per share amounts for all periods\npresented have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.\n3. Right-of-use Asset and Leasing Liabilities\nThe Company has operating and finance leases where it records the right-of-use assets and a related lease liabilities as required under the Financial\nAccounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842. The lease liabilities are determined by the net present value of total\nlease payments and amortized over the life of the lease. The Company’s leases are for the following types of assets:\n· Computer hardware and copy machines- The Company’s finance lease right-of-use assets consist of computer hardware and copy machines. These\nleases have a three-year life and are near completion.\n· Office space - The Company’s operating lease right-of-use assets include its rental agreements for its offices in Plano, TX, and a data service\ncenter in Allen, TX. The Plano offices operating lease expired on September 30, 2023. In October 2023, the Company signed a new lease with a\nterm of eleven years and one month and commenced upon completion of tenant improvements in April 2024. The data service center operating\nlease liability has a life of one year and three months as of June 30, 2024.\nIn accordance with ASC 842, the Company has elected practical expedients to combine lease and non-lease components, which consist principally of\ncommon area maintenance charges, for all classes of underlying assets and to exclude leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.\nAs the implicit rate is not readily determinable for the Company's lease agreements, the Company uses an estimated incremental borrowing rate to\ndetermine the initial present value of lease payments. This discount rate for the leases approximates the federal reserve’s prime rate.\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had $32 thousand and $37 thousand, respectively, in lease payments related to\noperating leases and had $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in lease payments related to financing leases.\n8\nSchedule of Items Appearing on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nOperating expense:\nAmortization expense – Finance ROU $ 163 $ 167 $ 329 $ 333\nLease expense – Operating ROU $ 118 $ 79 $ 201 $ 156\nOther expense:\nInterest expense – Finance ROU $ – $ 5 $ – $ 11\nFuture minimum lease obligations consisted of the following as of June 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nOperating Finance\nYear ending December 31, ROU Leases ROU Leases Total\nRemaining 2024 $ 207 $ 119 $ 326\n2025 256 3 259\n2026 196 – 196\n2027 165 – 165\n2028 223 – 223\nThereafter 1,517 – 1,517\n$ 2,564 $ 122 $ 2,686\nLess Interest* (884) –\n$ 1,680 $ 122\n* Interest is imputed for operating ROU leases and classified as lease expense and is included in operating expenses in the accompanying unaudited\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations.\n4. Notes Payable\nSecurity Purchase Agreement\nOn March 10, 2022, Intrusion Inc. entered into an unsecured loan agreement (“SPA”) with Streeterville Capital, LLC (“Streeterville”) whereby the\nCompany issued two separate promissory notes of $5.4 million each with an initial rate of 7%. On March 10, 2022, the Company received $4.6 million in net\nfunds from the first tranche (Note 1) pursuant to a promissory note executed contemporaneously with the execution of the loan agreement. On June 29, 2022,\nthe Company received an additional $4.7 million in net funds from the second tranche (Note 2) pursuant to a promissory note. Each note has an 18-month\nmaturity, may be prepaid subject to varying prepayment premiums, and may be redeemed at any time after six months into the term of such note in amounts up\nto $0.5 million per calendar month upon the noteholder’s election. On January 11, 2023, the Company amended the promissory notes issued pursuant to the\nunsecured loan agreement with Streeterville whereby the noteholder agreed to waive their redemption rights through March 31, 2023, in exchange for a fee\nequal to 3.75% of the outstanding principal balance which increased the outstanding indebtedness due at maturity with Streeterville and increased the\nassociated debt issuance costs recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets by $0.4 million. On August 2, 2023, the Company entered into a\nForbearance Agreement with Streeterville which was subsequently amended on August 7, 2023. The Forbearance Agreement and amendment extended the\nmaturity dates for each Note by twelve months to September 2024 and December 2024. In consideration of the extension of the maturity dates, the Company\nentered into a Security Agreement with Streeterville, dated August 2, 2023 (the “Security Agreement”), under which Streeterville was granted a first-position\nsecurity interest in all assets of the Company.\n9\nIn March 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Streeterville to exchange $0.2 million in principal for 52.2 thousand shares of common\nstock. Also in March 2024, the Company exchanged $9.3 million in Streeterville debt for 9.3 thousand shares of newly created Series A Preferred. The issuance\nof both common and preferred shares was made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements afforded by the Securities Act, as amended. The\ndesignations for the Series A Preferred preclude the Company from repaying any indebtedness for so long as any Series A Preferred shares are outstanding. The\nSeries A Preferred have a stated value of $1,100 per share and are subject to preferences and designations as more fully described in our Amended and Restated\nArticles of Incorporation filed on March 15, 2024, see also Note 6 Stockholders’ Equity. Following the exchanges noted herein, the remaining balance on Note\nOne was $0.5 million. The maturity date for Note One is September 2024 which conflicts with the Series A Preferred designation prohibiting repayment of any\nindebtedness.\nAs a result of exchanging $9.5 million principal in aggregate for equity, the Company reversed the interest accretion associated with the ability to\nstock-settle principal redemptions and wrote off the balance of unamortized debt issuance costs of $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nSimple interest of $9 thousand $153 thousand was incurred for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.\nScott Notes Payable\nDuring the period ended March 2024, the Company entered into two separate note purchase agreements with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer,\nAnthony Scott. On January 2, 2024, Scott purchased a note payable in the principal amount of $1.1 million in exchange for $1.0 million in cash. The note\ncalled for weekly payments of $40 thousand until maturity on June 15, 2024. Interest accrued on the balance of the note at 7% per annum compounding daily.\nDuring the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company made $0.2 million in principal payments on the first note payable.\nOn March 20, 2024, Scott purchased a second note payable in the principal amount of $343 thousand in exchange for $340 thousand in cash. The note\nwas non-interest bearing and matured on April 19, 2024. On April 2nd, the Company reduced the principal balance due under the note by $101 thousand which\nreflected the amount due from Scott for the exercise of common stock purchase warrants.\nOn April 19, 2024, Scott entered into a private placement subscription agreement to convert the aggregate outstanding balance of $1.1 million for both\nnotes in exchange for common stock and common stock purchase warrants.\nThe Company recorded interest expense of $20 thousand for both notes in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the\nsix months ended June 30, 2024. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, $83 thousand in amortization of debt issuance cost was recorded.\n5. Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is periodically involved in various litigation claims asserted in the normal course of its business. The Company believes these actions are\nroutine and incidental to the business. While the outcome of these actions cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that any will have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company’s business.\nStockholder Derivative Claim\nOn June 3, 2022, a verified stockholder derivative complaint was filed in U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (the “Court”) by the Plaintiff\nStockholder on behalf of Intrusion against certain of the Company’s Defendants. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants through various actions breached their\nfiduciary duties, wasted corporate assets, and unjustly enriched Defendants by (a) incurring costs and expenses in connection with the ongoing SEC\ninvestigation, (b) incurring costs and expenses to defend the Company with respect to the consolidated class action, (c) settling class-wide liability with respect\nto the consolidated class action, as well as ancillary claims regarding sales of the Company’s common stock by certain of the Defendants. On September 28,\n2023, the Company agreed to settle the claim. On October 2, 2023, public notice of the settlement was given. The settlement agreement provides in part for (i)\nan amendment to the Company’s Bylaws, committee Charters, and other applicable corporate policies to implement certain measures set forth more fully\ntherein, to remain in effect for no less than three years; (ii) attorneys’ fees and expenses to plaintiff’s counsel of $0.3 million; and (iii) the dismissal of all\nclaims against the Defendants, including the Company, in connection with the action. The $0.3 million settlement payment was made by the Company’s\ninsurance provider under its insurance policy since the Company’s $0.5 million retention was previously exhausted. On April 3, 2024, the Court approved the\nsettlement.\nIn addition to these legal proceedings, the Company is subject to various other claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company\ndoes not believe that any claims exist where the outcome of such matters would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated\nfinancial position, operating results, or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance such legal proceedings will not have a material impact on the\nCompany’s future results.\n10\n6. Stockholder’s Equity\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nOn March 15, 2024, the Company filed a certificate of designation of preferences and rights (the “Certificate of Designation”) of Series A Preferred\nStock (the “Series A Stock”), with the Secretary of State of Delaware, designating 20,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 of the Company, as Series\nA Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Stock shall have a stated face value of $1,100.00 (“Stated Value”). The Series A Stock is not convertible into\ncommon shares of capital stock of the Company and as such is non-dilutive to current stockholders.\nEach share of Series A Stock shall accrue a rate of return on the Stated Value at the rate of 10% per year, compounded annually from the date of\nissuance and payable quarterly in cash or the issuance of additional shares of Series A Stock.\nCommencing on the one-year anniversary of the issuance date of each share of Series A Stock to the two-year anniversary, each share of Series A\nStock shall accrue an automatic quarterly dividend, calculated on the Stated Value at a rate of 2.5% per quarter. For all periods following the two-year\nanniversary of the issuance date of each share of Series A Stock, the quarterly dividend shall be 5%. The quarterly dividend shall be payable quarterly in cash\nor the issuance of additional shares of Series A Stock. In the event the Company is unable to pay the Quarterly Dividend of Preferred Return in cash and no\nremaining shares of Series A Stock are available for issuance, the Quarterly Dividend and Preferred Return will continue to accrue until such time the Company\ncan make payment. The Company classified the Series A Preferred Stock as equity as all events that could trigger redemption are fully within the Company’s\ncontrol.\nOn March 15, 2024, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with Streeterville Capital that exchanged $9.3 million in debt for 9,275 shares\nof newly created Series A Preferred Stock.\nOn April 3, 2024, the Company exchanged 91 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for 32,248 shares of our common stock. On May 10, 2024, the\nCompany exchanged 125 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for 90,460 shares of our common stock. On May 30, 2024, the Company exchanged 339 shares of\nSeries A Preferred Stock for 243,725 shares of our common stock. All of these exchanges were made pursuant to the exemption from the registration\nrequirements afforded by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nThrough June 30, 2024, the Company has paid a preferred return of $290 thousand through the issuance of 265 additional shares of Series A Preferred\nStock.\nPrivate Offering\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company sold to certain purchasers 1,348,569 shares of the Company’s common stock together with accompanying common\nstock purchase warrants to purchase 2,697,138 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $1.95 per share (or common stock equivalent) and two\naccompanying Common Stock Purchase Warrants, for net proceeds of approximately $2.6 million. The Common Stock Purchase Warrants will be exercisable\nat any time following the date of issuance, expire five years following the date of issuance, and have an exercise price of $1.70 per share. None of the shares of\nCommon Stock and shares underlying the Common Stock Purchase Warrants have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and do not\ncarry registration rights.\n11\nATM Offering\nB. Riley Securities, Inc. acts as sales agent for the Company’s ATM program, which allows the Company to potentially sell up to $50.0 million of the\nCompany’s common stock using a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed on August 5, 2021. On March 31, 2023, the date the Company filed its Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company became subject to the offering limits in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-\n3. As a result, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus relating to the registration of offerings under the program that reduced the amount\nthe Company may sell to aggregate proceeds of up to $15 million. For the period ended June 30, 2024, the Company received proceeds of approximately $3.3\nmillion net of fees from the sale of common stock pursuant to the program. As of June 30, 2024, the Company has received proceeds of approximately $15.5\nmillion net of fees from the sales of 4.3 million shares of common stock since the inception of the program.\nCommon Stock Warrants\nOn April 1, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved entry into a warrant inducement offering that provided, during the period beginning on\nApril 2, 2024 and continuing through April 23, 2024, for the lowering of the exercise price of all outstanding warrants and, for each share of common stock\nexercised under the warrants, providing the participating warrant holder with a new warrant for that same number of shares of common stock. The reduced\nexercise price of the warrants was $3.04. The new warrant exercise price is $2.91 with an exercise period of five years. On April 8, 2024, certain holders of the\nwarrants exercised 186 thousand shares of the Company’s common stock resulting in gross proceeds of $0.6 million and the issuance of 186 thousand new\nwarrants. The issuance of the new Warrants was undertaken pursuant to the exemption from registration provided in Rule 506(b) under Regulation D pursuant\nto the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nOn June 30, 2024, the Company had 52,471 warrants to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $104.40, 257,604 warrants to\npurchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $12.00, 186,492 warrants to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $2.91, and\n2,697,138 warrants to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $1.70.\n7. Revenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes product revenue upon shipment or after meeting certain performance obligations. These products can include hardware,\nsoftware subscriptions and consulting services. The Company also offers software on a subscription basis subject to software as a service (“SaaS”). Warranty\ncosts have not been material.\nThe Company recognizes sales of the Company’s datasets in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 606 whereby revenue from contracts with customers\nare recognized once the criteria under the five steps below have been met:\ni) identification of the contract with a customer;\nii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\niii) determination of the transaction price;\niv) allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance obligations; and\nv) recognize revenue upon satisfaction of a performance obligation.\nConsulting services include reporting and are typically done monthly, and revenue is matched accordingly. Product sales may include maintenance and\ncustomer support allocated revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy\nusing the relative selling price method. All product offering and service offering market values are readily determined based on current and prior stand-alone\nsales. The Company defers and recognizes maintenance, updates, and support revenue over the term of the contract period, which is generally one year.\n12\nNormal payment terms offered to customers, distributors and resellers are net 30 days domestically. The Company does not offer payment terms that\nextend beyond one year and rarely does it extend payment terms beyond its normal terms. If certain customers do not meet its credit standards, the Company\ntypically requires payment in advance to limit its credit exposure.\nWith the Company’s newest product, INTRUSION Shield, the Company began offering software on a subscription basis. INTRUSION Shield is a\nhosted arrangement subject to SaaS guidance under ASC 606. SaaS arrangements are accounted for as subscription services, not arrangements that transfer a\nlicense of intellectual property.\nThe Company utilizes the five-step process, mentioned above, per FASB ASC Topic 606 to recognize sales and will follow that directive, also, to\ndefine revenue items as individual and distinct. INTRUSION Shield services provided to its customers for a fixed monthly subscription fee include:\n· access to Intrusion’s proprietary software and database to detect and prevent unauthorized access to its clients’ information networks;\n· use of all software, associated media, printed materials, data, files, online documentation, and any equipment that Intrusion provides for customers\nto access the INTRUSION Shield; and\n· tech support, post contract customer support (PCS) includes daily program releases or corrections provided by Intrusion without additional charge.\nINTRUSION Shield contracts provide for no other services, and the Company’s customers have no rebates or return rights, nor are any such rights\nanticipated to be offered as part of this service.\nThe Company satisfies its performance obligation when the INTRUSION Shield solution is available to detect and prevent unauthorized access to a\nclient’s information networks. Revenue should be recognized monthly over the term of the contract. The Company’s standard initial contract terms\nautomatically renew unless notice is given 30 days before renewal. Upfront payment of fees is deferred and amortized into income over the period covered by\nthe contract.\nThe Company’s accounts receivable represents unconditional contract billings for sales per contracts with customers and are classified as current\nassets. As of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had accounts receivable balances of $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively. As of June\n30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had an allowance for credit losses of $0.1 million.\nThe Company classifies its contract assets as receivables because the Company generally has an unconditional right to payment for the Company’s\nsales or services performed at the end of the reporting period.\nContract liabilities consist of cash payments in advance of the Company satisfying performance obligations and recognizing revenue. The Company\ncurrently classifies deferred revenue as a contract liability.\nThe following table presents changes in the Company’s contract liability during the period ended June 30, 2024, and the year ended December 31,\n2023 (in thousands):\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBalance at beginning of period $ 439 $ 455\nAdditions 1,699 4,727\nRevenue recognized (1,560) (4,743)\nBalance at end of period $ 578 $ 439\n13\n8. Capitalized Software Development\nThe Company capitalizes internally developed software using the Agile software development methodology which allows the Company to accurately\ntrack, and record costs associated with new software development and enhancements.\nPursuant to ASC Topic 350-40 Internal Use Software Accounting Capitalization, certain development costs related to the Company’s products during\nthe application development stage are capitalized as part of property and equipment. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as\nincurred. The preliminary stage includes such activities as conceptual formulation of alternatives, evaluation of alternatives, determination of existence of\nneeded technology, and the final selection of alternatives. Once the application development stage is reached, internal and external costs are capitalized until\nthe software is complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized internal use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life,\nwhich is generally three years.\n9. Net Loss Per Share\nThe Company reports two separate net loss per share numbers, basic and diluted. Basic net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is\ncomputed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the\nperiod. Diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the period\nby the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. The common stock equivalents include\nall common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants, options and vesting of restricted stock awards. The aggregate number of common stock\nequivalents excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 totaled 3,117 and 125 thousand shares,\nrespectively. The aggregate number of common stock equivalents excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation for the six months ended June 30, 2024,\nand 2023 totaled 1,743 and 114 thousand shares, respectively. Since the Company is in a net loss position for the periods ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, basic\nand dilutive net loss per share is the same.\n10. Related Party Transactions\nOn January 2, 2024, the Company entered into an invoice financing arrangement pursuant to a note purchase agreement with Anthony Scott, President,\nand Chief Executive Officer of the Company (“Scott”), according to which, among other things, Scott purchased from the Company a promissory note (the\n“Promissory Note”) in the aggregate principal amount of $1.1 million in exchange for $1.0 million to the Company. Under the Promissory Note, the Company\nshall make Weekly Payments to Scott in the amount of $40 thousand per week. Interest accrues on the balance of the Promissory Note at a rate of 7.0% per\nannum, compounded daily. In connection with the issuance of the Promissory Note, the Company and Scott also entered into a security agreement, which\nprovides, according to its terms, a security interest in all accounts receivable or other receivables now existing or subsequently created prior to the payment of\nthe Promissory Note, subject to prior permitted liens. During the six months ended June 20, 2024, the Company made $0.2 million in principal payments on the\nPromissory Note.\nOn March 20, 2024, the Company entered into an additional invoice financing arrangement pursuant to a note purchase agreement with Scott,\naccording to which, among other things, Scott purchased from the Company a second Promissory Note 2 in the aggregate principal amount of $343 thousand in\nexchange for $340 thousand to the Company. The Promissory Note 2 is non-interest bearing and matures on April 19, 2024.\nOn April 2, 2024 the Company reduced the principal balance due under the Promissory Note by $0.1 million which reflected the amount due from\nScott for the exercise of common stock purchase warrants.\nOn April 19, 2024, Scott entered into a private placement subscription agreement to convert the aggregate outstanding balance of $1.1 million for both\nnotes in exchange for common stock and common stock purchase warrants.\nThe Company recorded interest expense of $20 thousand for both notes in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the\nsix months ended June 30, 2024. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, $83 thousand in amortization of debt issuance cost was recorded.\n11. Subsequent Events\nOn July 3, 2024, the Company entered into a $10 million Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (“SEPA”) with Streeterville Capital, LLC\n(“Streeterville”) pursuant to which the Company has the right to direct Streeterville during the 24 month term of the agreement to purchase common stock\nsubject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the SEPA.\n14\nItem 2.

After many years of gathering intelligence and providing our INTRUSION TraceCop and Savant solutions\nexclusively to government entities, we released our first commercial product in 2021, the INTRUSION Shield. INTRUSION Shield was designed to allow\nbusinesses to incorporate a Zero Trust, reputation-based security solution into their existing infrastructure to observe traffic flow and instantly block known\nmalicious or unknown connections from both entering or exiting a network, making it an ideal solution for protecting from Zero-Day and ransomware attacks.\nAs discussed in more detail below on June 30, 2024, we had $1.5 million in cash. If we are not able to raise adequate funds under the Company’s ATM\nprogram or obtain additional equity financing, the Company may be unable to implement the Company’s business plan, fund its liquidity needs or even\ncontinue its operations.\n15\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nRevenue $ 1,460 $ 1,468 $ (8) -1% $ 2,591 $ 2,777 $ (186) -7%\nCost of revenue 350 330 20 6% 576 643 (67) -10%\nGross profit 1,110 1,138 (28) -2% 2,015 2,134 (119 -6%\nGross profit percentage 76.0% 77.5% 77.8% 76.8%\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 1,158 1,423 (265) -68% 2,335 3,161 (826) -26%\nResearch and development 1,035 1,451 (416) -29% 2,054 3,247 (1,193) -37%\nGeneral and administrative 950 1,185 (235) -20% 2,131 2,691 (560) -21%\nTotal operating expenses 3,143 4,059 (916) -23% 6,520 9,099 (2,579) -28%\nOperating Loss (2,033) (2,921) 888 30% (4,505) (6,965) 2,460 35%\nInterest expense (34) (233) 199 -85% (262) (518) 256 -49%\nInterest accretion and amortization of debt issuance\ncosts, net – 25 (25) -100% 990 (421) 1,399 -334%\nOther (expense) income, net – – – 0% (6) 41 (47) 115%\nNet loss $ (2,067) $ (3,129) $ 1,062 34% $ (3,783) $ (7,863) $ 4,080 52%\nRevenues. Revenue for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024, was $1.5 and $2.6 million compared to $1.5 and $2.8 million for the\nsame periods in 2023. Revenue from consulting totaled $1.2 and $1.9 million for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024, compared to $1.1 and\n$2.1 million for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2023. The continuing resolution and delay in the approval of a federal budget for the 2024 year\nwhich did not occur until March 22, 2024, impacted the timing of renewals and task orders received for long-standing contracts which resulted in a decline in\nconsulting revenues for the six month period ended June 30, 2024. INTRUSION Shield revenues were $0.3 and $0.7 million for the three and six month\nperiods ended June 30, 2024, compared to $0.4 million and $0.7 million for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2023. The decline in Shield\nrevenues for the three month period resulted from the loss of a large early INTRUSION Shield customer that had implemented a highly customized and non-\nstandard configuration of the product. The loss of revenues from this customer was partially offset by revenues from new customers signed in recent quarters.\nWe believe the revenues from these new customers and several transactions that we anticipate will close in the second half of this year will fully offset this loss\nand drive INTRUSION Shield revenue growth in 2024.\nConcentration of Revenues. For the three and six month periods ended and June 30, 2024, revenues from sales to various U.S. government entities\ntotaled $1.3 and $2.0 million, or 89.0% and 75.7% of revenues compared to $0.7 and $1.3 million, or 46.7% and 47.5% of revenues, for the same periods in\n2023. Although we expect our concentration of revenues to vary among customers in future periods depending upon the timing of certain sales, we anticipate\nthat sales to government customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods. Sales to the government present risks in\naddition to those involved in sales to commercial customers which could adversely affect our revenues, including, without limitation, potential disruption to\nappropriation and spending patterns and the government’s reservation of the right to cancel contracts and purchase orders for its convenience. Although we do\nnot anticipate that any of our revenues from government customers will be renegotiated, any cancelled or renegotiated government orders could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial results. We had one commercial customer in the six months ended June 30, 2024, and two commercial customers in the 2023\nperiod, that each contributed individually to more than 10% of our total revenue. Our similar product and service offerings are not viewed as individual\nsegments, as its management analyzes the business as a whole and expenses are not allocated to each product offering.\n16\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $1.1 and $2.0 million or 76.0% and 77.8% of revenues for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024,\ncompared to $1.1 and $2.1 million or 77.5% and 76.8% of revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The gross profit margin will vary\ndepending on product mix. INTRUSION Shield revenues represented 20.5% and 28.3% of revenues for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024,\ncompared to 28.6% and 26.3% in the same periods 2023.\nOperating Expenses. Operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, totaled $3.1 and $6.5 million, representing a decrease of\n23% and 28% when compared to $4.1 and $9.1 million for the same periods in 2023. The decrease was most notably due to a reduction in staffing and contract\nlabor expenses in addition to reduced spend on sales and marketing and reduced litigation defense costs.\nIn late March 2023 we implemented cost reduction measures that resulted in the reduction of sixteen permanent positions, the reduced use of\ncontractors and renegotiating or replacing spend on certain sales support and marketing services with less costly programs. Headcount at June 30, 2024, and\n2023 was fifty and forty-nine, respectively. Many of the reductions were in Research and Development, which will impact the number and frequency of\nproduct releases. As we grow our customer base and increase our revenues, we may choose to accelerate our product development in future periods, which\nwould result in increased spending.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $1.2 and $2.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to\n$1.4 and $3.2 million for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2023. The 2024 six month period includes approximately $0.2 million in one-time\nnegotiated contract savings. Certain discretionary spend, inclusive of participation in trade shows, utilization of third-party contractors for content and product\nmessaging and travel, are likely to vary over time based on savings initiatives that may be necessary.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses totaled $1.0 and $2.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, a\n$0.4 and $1.2 million decrease compared to the same periods in 2023. The savings are a result of cost reduction measures implemented in late March 2023\nwhich included the reduction of 13 FTEs and the reduced use of contractors. Research and development costs may vary over time as we determine the\nfrequency of new releases, improved functionality and enhancements needed to be competitive with our product offering.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses totaled $1.0 and $2.1 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024,\ncompared to $1.2 and $2.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The $0.6 million reduction in the six month period relates to the\nelimination of two positions, reduced share-based compensation and one-time negotiated cost savings of $0.1 million.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, was $34 thousand and $262 thousand consisting principally of\nthe stated interest related to the Streeterville notes, interest associated with the note’s payable issued to Scott, our CEO and finance leases. Interest expense for\nthe three and six months ended June 30, 2023, was $233 thousand and $530 thousand. The decreased interest expense resulted principally from the aggregate\nexchange of the Streeterville debt to both common and preferred stock. At June 30, 2024, only $511 thousand of Streeterville debt remains outstanding. Interest\nexpense will vary in the future based on our cash flow and borrowing needs.\nInterest Accretion and Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs. During the March 2024 quarter, the Company entered into exchange agreements to\nconvert $9.5 million in Streeterville debt to $9.3 million of Series A preferred stock and $0.2 million to common stock and, as a result, the Company reversed\nthe interest accretion associated with the ability to stock-settle principal redemptions and wrote-off the remaining deferred debt issue costs resulting in a net\ncredit to interest expense of $1.0 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the interest accretion and amortization of debt issuance costs totaled $0.4\nmillion.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net. Other income and expense were nominal amounts for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023.\n17\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 million and a working capital deficit of $(0.5) million. Management plans to fund the\noperations of the Company through the continued use of the ATM and or additional equity financings. If the Company is not able to raise adequate funds, the\nCompany may be unable to implement the Company’s business plan, fund its liquidity needs or even continue its operations.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur principal sources of cash for funding operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024, has been proceeds received from the issuance of common\nstock in a series of transactions which include $3.3 million from ATM sales, $2.6 million from a private placement, and $0.6 million from the exercise of\nwarrants. Our principal source of cash for funding operations in 2023 was $1.3 million from sales of common stock utilizing the ATM program and changes in\nworking capital which includes the receipt of $1.2 million in Employee Retention Tax Credit refunds recorded in 2022.\nStand-by Equity Purchase Agreement\nOn July 3, 2024, we entered into a $10 million Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (“SEPA”) with Streeterville Capital, LLC (“Streeterville”)\npursuant to which the Company has the right to direct Streeterville during the 24 month term of the agreement to purchase common stock subject to certain\nlimitations and conditions set forth in the SEPA.\nThe shares of common stock purchased pursuant to SEPA will be at a purchase price equal to 95% of the lowest daily VWAP of the shares of Common\nStock during the three consecutive trading days commencing on the date of the delivery of an advance notice. “VWAP” is defined as the daily volume weighted\naverage price of the shares of Common Stock for such trading day on the Nasdaq Stock Market during regular trading hours as reported by Bloomberg L.P.\nUnder applicable Nasdaq rules and the terms of the SEPA, in no event may the Company issue to Streeterville under the SEPA shares of Common\nStock equal to greater than 19.99% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the execution of the SEPA (the “Exchange Cap”), unless\n(i) the Company obtains stockholder approval to issue shares of Common Stock in excess of the Exchange Cap in accordance with applicable Nasdaq rules, or\n(ii) the average price per share paid by Streeterville for all of the shares of Common Stock that the Company directs Streeterville to purchase from the\nCompany pursuant to the SEPA, if any, equals or exceeds the lower of (a) the official closing price of the Common Stock on Nasdaq immediately preceding the\nexecution of the SEPA or (b) the average official closing price of the Common Stock on Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding\nthe execution of the SEPA, adjusted as required by Nasdaq. Moreover, the Company may not issue or sell any shares of Common Stock to Streeterville under\nthe SEPA which, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by Streeterville and its affiliates (as calculated pursuant to\nSection 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-3 thereunder), would result in Streeterville beneficially owning more than 19.99% of the outstanding shares of\nCommon Stock. The Company is seeking stockholder approval under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d) for the sale, issuance or potential issuance by the Company\nof Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for our Common Stock) in excess of 20% of the shares of our Common Stock outstanding\nimmediately prior to the SEPA at an exercise price less than the Minimum Price in connection with the SEPA.\nActual sales of shares of Common Stock to Streeterville as an advance under the SEPA will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the\nCompany from time to time, which may include, among other things, market conditions, the trading price of the Common Stock and determinations by the\nCompany as to the appropriate sources of funding for our business and operations. The Company will use 10% of the proceeds associated with each Advance to\nredeem the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock held by Streeterville.\n18\nAt-The-Market Program\nB. Riley Securities, Inc. acts as sales agent under the Company’s at-the-market program, which allowed us to potentially sell up to $50.0 million of its\ncommon stock using the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed on August 5, 2021. On April 11, 2023, Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 and in agreement\nwith the terms of the sales agreement, the company revised the aggregate offering price of shares of common stock that we can sell pursuant to the ATM\nprogram to $15 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, we received $3.3 million, net of fees for sales of common stock were made pursuant to the\nprogram. As of June 30, 2024, the remaining aggregate offering price of shares of common stock that we can sell pursuant to the ATM program based on gross\nproceeds was $6.7 million.\nNotes Payable\nIn March 2024, we entered into an agreement with Streeterville to exchange $0.2 million in principal for 52.2 thousand shares of common stock. Also\nin March 2024, we exchanged $9.3 million in Streeterville debt for 9,275 shares of our newly created Series A Preferred. The issuance of both common and\npreferred shares was made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements afforded by the Securities Act, as amended. The designations for the\nSeries A Preferred preclude the Company from repaying any indebtedness for so long as any Series A Preferred shares are outstanding. The Series A Preferred\nshares have a stated value of $1,100 per share and are subject to preferences and designations as more fully described in our Amended and Restated Articles of\nIncorporation filed on March 15, 2024. Following the exchanges noted herein, the remaining balance on Note One was $0.5 million at June 30, 2024. The\nmaturity date for Note One is September 2024 which conflicts with the Series A Preferred designation prohibiting repayment of any indebtedness. We are in\ndiscussions with Streeterville to modify the terms of the Note One agreement.\nDuring the March 2024 quarter we entered into two separate note purchase agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Scott. On January 2,\n2024, Scott purchased a note payable in the principal amount of $1.1 million in exchange for $1.0 million in cash. The note called for weekly payments of\n$40,000 until maturity on June 15, 2024. Interest accrued on the balance of the note at 7% per annum compounding daily. During the March quarter we made\n$200 thousand in principal payments. On March 20, 2024, Scott purchased a second note payable in the principal amount of $343 thousand in exchange for\n$340 thousand in cash. The note was non-interest bearing and matured on April 19, 2024. On April 2nd, we reduced the principal balance due under the note by\n$101 thousand which reflected the amount due from Scott for the exercise of common stock purchase warrants. On April 19, 2024, Scott entered into a private\nplacement subscription agreement to convert the aggregate remaining outstanding balance of $1.1 million for both notes in exchange for common stock and\ncommon stock purchase warrants.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nOur cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 were:\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (4,036) $ (3,275)\nNet cash used in investing activities (697) (717)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 6,100 1,277\nChange in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,367 $ (2,715)\n19\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was ($4.0) million primarily resulting from 1) a net loss of ($3.8) million offset\npartially offset by adjustments for non-cash items of $0.4 million which are mostly comprised of depreciation, stock-based compensation and non-cash interest\nrelated to the Streeterville notes, and 2) changes in working capital of ($0.7) million which consisted principally of increased accounts receivable and decreased\nvendor payables.\nNet cash used in operations for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was ($3.3) million due primarily to a net loss of ($7.9) million partially offset by\n1) adjustments for non-cash items of $2.2 million which are mostly comprised of depreciation, stock-based compensation and interest related to Streeterville\nnotes, and 2) changes in working capital of $2.4 million consisting principally of the cash receipt of amounts due relating to Employee Retention Credit and\namounts received as prepayment for a one year customer contract.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $0.7 million, which was comprised of capitalization of internally\ndeveloped software and hardware purchases. Net cash used by investing activities, for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was $0.7 million principally for\ncapitalization of internally developed software.\nFinancing Activities\nFor six months ended June 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $6.1 million which resulted from $6.5 million in net proceeds\nfrom the sale of common stock through the use our ATM program, private placement offering, and the exercise of warrants partially offset by finance lease\npayments. Net proceeds from financing activities of $1.3 million for six months ended June 30, 2023, resulted principally from sales of common stock using\nour ATM program.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related\ndisclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We\nevaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences\nbetween these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nWe believe the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, reflect our more\nsignificant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes to our\ncritical accounting policies and estimates as filed in such report.\n20\nItem 3.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive\nofficer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply our reasonable judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of\npotential disclosure controls and procedures.\nAs of June 30, 2024, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design\nand operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2024.\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n21\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nStockholder Derivative Claim\nOn June 3, 2022, a stockholder derivative complaint was filed in U.S. District Court, District of Delaware the Court by the Plaintiff Stockholder on\nbehalf of Intrusion against Defendants. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants through various actions breached their fiduciary duties, wasted corporate assets, and\nunjustly enriched Defendants by (a) incurring costs and expenses in connection with the ongoing SEC investigation, (b) incurring costs and expenses to defend\nus with respect to the consolidated class action, (c) settling class-wide liability with respect to the consolidated class action, as well as ancillary claims\nregarding sales of our common stock by certain of the Defendants. On September 28, 2023, we agreed to settle the claim. On October 2, 2023, public notice of\nthe settlement agreement was given. The settlement agreement provides in part for (i) an amendment to our Bylaws, committee Charters, and other applicable\ncorporate policies to implement certain measures set forth more fully therein, to remain in effect for no less than three years; (ii) attorneys’ fees and expenses to\nplaintiff’s counsel of $0.3 million; and (iii) the dismissal of all claims against the Defendants, including the Company, in connection with the action. The $0.3\nmillion settlement payment was made by our insurance provider under our insurance policy since our $0.5 million retention was previously exhausted. On\nApril 3, 2024, the Court approved the settlement.\nIn addition to these legal proceedings, we are subject to various other claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that\nany claims exist where the outcome of such matters would have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial position, operating results, or\ncash flows. However, there can be no assurance such legal proceedings will not have a material impact on our future results.\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the risk factor set forth below, you should carefully\nconsider the risk factors we previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 (the “Annual Report”). These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash\nflows. However, these risks are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial\nalso may impair our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur stock price is likely to be highly volatile because of several factors, including a limited public float.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile in the\nfuture. You may not be able to resell shares of our common stock following periods of volatility because of the market’s adverse reaction to volatility.\nOther factors that could cause such volatility may include, among other things:\n· actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n· the absence of securities analysts covering us and distributing research and recommendations about us;\n· we may have a low trading volume for a number of reasons, including that a large portion of our stock is closely held;\n· overall stock market fluctuations;\n· announcements concerning our business or those of our competitors;\n22\n· actual or perceived limitations on our ability to raise capital when we require it, and to raise such capital on favorable terms;\n· conditions or trends in the industry;\n· litigation;\n· changes in market valuations of other similar companies;\n· future sales of common stock;\n· departure of key personnel or failure to hire key personnel; and\n· general market conditions.\nAny of these factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general has\nat times experienced extreme volatility and rapid decline that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular\ncompanies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of common stock could cause the market price of our shares of common stock to decline.\nWe have agreed, at our expense, to prepare and file with the SEC certain registration statements providing for the resale of shares of common stock,\nincluding this registration statement. The resale, or expected or potential resale, of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market\ncould adversely affect the market price for our shares of common stock and make it more difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock at times and\nprices that you feel are appropriate. In particular, as a result of the SEPA, Streeterville is an “underwriter” as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(11) of\nSecurities Act, and the SEPA contemplates that Streeterville expects to resell any shares of common stock we may issue and sell pursuant thereto. Furthermore,\nwe expect that, because there will be a large number of shares registered, Streeterville will continue to offer such covered securities for a significant period of\ntime, the precise duration of which cannot be predicted. Accordingly, the adverse market and price pressures resulting from an offering pursuant to a\nregistration statement may continue for an extended period of time.\nThe issuances of additional shares of common stock under the SEPA may result in dilution of holders of common stock and have a negative impact on the\nmarket price of the common stock.\nPursuant to the SEPA, we may issue and sell up to $10 million worth of shares of common stock (“Advance Shares”) to Streeterville. The price at\nwhich we may issue and sell shares is at 95% of the lowest daily VWAP of the common stock during the three trading days following a notice to sell to\nStreeterville. Assuming that (a) we issue and sell the full $10 million worth of shares of common stock under the SEPA to Streeterville, (b) no beneficial\nownership limitations, and (c) the issue price for such sales is $1.08 per share, such additional issuances would represent in the aggregate approximately\n1,195,666 additional shares of common stock or approximately 16.5% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the date hereof, after\ngiving effect to such issuance. In addition, the Company issued 92,592 shares of common stock (the “Streeterville Commitment Shares”) to Streeterville upon\nthe effective date of the SEPA as consideration for its irrevocable commitment to purchase shares of common stock at our direction, from time to time after the\ndate of this prospectus. Furthermore, the Company issued 216,921 shares of common stock (the “Pre-Delivery Shares”) to Streeterville for the purchase price\nof $0.01 per share upon the effective date of the SEPA as further consideration for its irrevocable commitment to purchase shares of common stock at our\ndirection, from time to time after the date of this prospectus. If the beneficial ownership limitation is not waived, we may issue approximately 670,365, shares\nof common stock, or approximately 9.99% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the date hereof, after giving effect to such issuance.\nThe timing, frequency, and the price at which we issue shares of common stock are subject to market prices and management’s decision to sell shares of\ncommon stock, if at all.\n23\nUpon effectiveness of this registration statement, Streeterville may resell all, some or none of their shares of common stock beneficially owned by\nthem from time to time in their discretion and at different prices subject to the terms of the SEPA. As a result, investors will likely pay different prices for those\nshares, and so may experience different levels of dilution (and in some cases substantial dilution) and different outcomes in their investment results. Investors\nmay experience a decline in the value of the shares they purchase as a result of future issuances by the Company, whether to Streeterville or others at prices\nlower than the prices such investors paid for their shares. In addition, if we issue a substantial number of shares to such parties, or if investors expect that we\nwill do so, the actual sales of shares or the mere existence of the SEPA may adversely affect the price of our common stock or make it more difficult for us to\nsell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a desirable time and price, or at all.\nThe issuance, if any, of common stock would not affect the rights or privileges of the Company’s existing stockholders, except that the economic and\nvoting interests of existing stockholders would be diluted. Although the number of shares of common stock that existing stockholders own would not decrease\nas a result of these additional issuances, the shares of common stock owned by existing stockholders would represent a smaller percentage of the total\noutstanding shares of common stock after any such issuance, potentially significantly smaller.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our share price.\nAs of August 14, 2024, we had 6,641,525 shares of our common stock outstanding. Sales of a number of shares of common stock in the public market\nor issuances of additional shares pursuant to the exercise of our outstanding warrants, or the expectation of such sales or exercises, could cause the market price\nof our common stock to decline. We may also sell additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common\nstock in subsequent public or private offerings or other transactions, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nItem 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES USE OF PROCEEDS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nOn March 7, 2024, we agreed to exchange $0.2 million in aggregate principal on Streeterville Note 1 for fifty-two thousand shares of our common\nstock.\nOn March 15, 2024, we agreed to exchange $9.3 million in aggregate Streeterville debt for 9,275 shares of newly created Series A of Preferred stock.\nOn April 3, 2024, we agreed to exchange ninety-one shares of Series A Preferred Stock for 32,248 shares of our common stock. On May 10, 2024, we\nagreed to exchange 125 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for 90,460 shares of our common stock. On May 30, 2024, we agreed to exchange 339 shares of\nSeries A Preferred Stock for 243,725 shares of our common stock.\nOn April 22, 2024, we sold 1,348,569 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), together with\naccompanying common stock purchase warrants (the “Common Stock Purchase Warrants”) to purchase 2,697,138 shares of Common Stock, at a purchase\nprice of $1.95 per share (or common stock equivalent) and two accompanying Common Stock Purchase Warrants, for net proceeds of approximately $2.6\nmillion. The Common Stock Purchase Warrants will be exercisable at any time following the date of issuance, expire five years following the date of issuance,\nand have an exercise price of $1.70 per share. None of the shares of Common Stock and shares underlying the Common Stock Purchase Warrants have been\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and do not carry registration rights.\nThe above exchanges and sales were made pursuant to an exemption from registration as set forth as set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act\nand/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.\n24\nItem 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\nItem 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. OTHER INFORMATION\n(a) None.\n(b) There have been no material changes to procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to the Company’s Board of Directors\nsince the Company last provided disclosure in response to the requirements of Item 407(c)(3) of Regulation S-K.\n(c) During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, no director or officer adopted or terminated any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1\ntrading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nItem 6.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Description of Business\nIntrusion Inc. (together with its condensed consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Intrusion”, “Intrusion Inc.”, “we”, “us”, “our”, or similar terms)\nwas organized in Texas in September 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in October 1995. Our principal executive offices are located at 101 East Park\nBoulevard, Suite 1200, Plano, Texas 75074, and our telephone number is (972) 234-6400. Our website URL is www.intrusion.com.\nThe Company develops, sells, and supports products that protect any-sized company or government organization by fusing advanced threat intelligence\nwith real-time mitigation to kill cyberattacks as they occur – including Zero-Days. The Company markets and distributes the Company’s solutions through\nvalue-added resellers, managed service providers and a direct sales force. The Company’s end-user customers include United States (“U.S.”) federal\ngovernment entities, state and local government entities, and companies ranging in size from mid-market to large enterprises.\nTraceCop (“TraceCop™”) and Savant (“Savant™”) are registered trademarks of Intrusion Inc. The Company has applied for trademark protection for\nthe Company’s new INTRUSION Shield cybersecurity solution.\n2. Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted\nAccounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Item 10-01 of\nRegulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. All adjustments that,\nin the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the interim periods have been made and are of a recurring\nnature unless otherwise disclosed herein. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full\nyear. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”) on April 1, 2024. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company calculates the fair value of its assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments and includes this additional information in the\nnotes to condensed consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different from the carrying value of these financial instruments. The estimated fair\nvalue of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these\ninstruments. Notes payable and financing and operating leases approximate fair value as they bear market rates of interest. None of these instruments are held\nfor trading purposes.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of March 31, 2024, the\nCompany had cash and cash equivalents of $0.1 million and a working capital deficit of $4.7 million. In addition, the Company has incurred net operating\nlosses during the last four years. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the\ndate of these financial statements. The Company’s principal source of funding operations in the March 2024 quarter has been proceeds received from the\nissuance of notes payable to Management of $1.3 million and through the issuance of common stock using the Company’s ATM program which provided $0.5\nmillion. Subsequent to March 31, 2024, through the date of these financial statements, the Company has received $5.7 million in net proceeds from the\nissuance of common stock in a series of transactions which include $2.6 million from a private placement, $2.5 million from ATM sales and $0.6 million from\nthe exercise of warrants. As of May 10, 2024, the Company had $2.4 million in cash. Management plans to fund the operations of the Company through the\nissuance of common stock using a combination of the ATM and additional private placements. If the Company is not able to raise adequate funds under the\nCompany’s ATM program or obtain additional equity financing, the Company may be unable to implement the Company’s business plan, fund its liquidity\nneeds or even continue its operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and\nliabilities that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\n7\nThe audit opinion that accompanied the Company’s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, was qualified in that the\nCompany’s auditors expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nReverse Stock Split\nThe Company effected a reverse stock split of 1-for-20 on March 22, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all share and per share amounts for all periods\npresented have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.\n3. Right-of-use Asset and Leasing Liabilities\nThe Company has operating and finance leases where it records the right-of-use assets and a related lease liability as required under the Financial\nAccounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842. The lease liabilities are determined by the net present value of total\nlease payments and amortized over the life of the lease. The Company’s leases are for the following types of assets:\n· Computer hardware and copy machines- The Company’s finance lease right-of-use assets consist of computer hardware and copy machines. These\nleases have a three-year life and are near completion.\n· Office space - The Company’s operating lease right-of-use assets include its rental agreements for its offices in Plano, TX, and a data service\ncenter in Allen, TX. The Plano offices operating lease expired on September 30, 2023. In October 2023, the Company signed a new lease with a\nterm of eleven years and one month and commences upon completion of tenant improvements. The data service center operating lease liability has\na life of one year and six months as of March 31, 2024.\nIn accordance with ASC 842, the Company has elected practical expedients to combine lease and non-lease components, which consist principally of\ncommon area maintenance charges, for all classes of underlying assets and to exclude leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.\nAs the implicit rate is not readily determinable for the Company's lease agreements, the Company uses an estimated incremental borrowing rate to\ndetermine the initial present value of lease payments. This discount rate for the leases approximates the federal reserve’s prime rate.\nFor the three months ended March 21, 2024, and 2023, the Company had $5 thousand and $86 thousand, respectively, in lease payments related to\noperating leases and had $0.1 million and $14 thousand, respectively, in lease payments related to financing leases.\nSchedule of Items Appearing on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\nOperating expense:\nAmortization Expense – Finance ROU $ 166 $ 166\nLease expense – Operating ROU $ 83 $ 77\nOther expense:\nInterest Expense – Finance ROU $ – $ 6\n8\nFuture minimum lease obligations consisted of the following as of March 31, 2024 (in thousands):\nOperating Finance\nYear ending December 31, ROU Leases ROU Leases Total\nRemaining 2024 $ 286 $ 283 $ 569\n2025 256 3 259\n2026 196 – 196\n2027 165 – 165\n2028 223 – 223\nThereafter 1,517 – 1,517\n$ 2,643 $ 286 $ 2,929\nLess Interest* (916) –\n$ 1,727 $ 286\n* Interest is imputed for operating ROU leases and classified as lease expense and is included in operating expenses in the accompanying unaudited\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations.\n4. Notes Payable\nSecurity Purchase Agreement\nOn March 10, 2022, Intrusion Inc. entered into an unsecured loan agreement (“SPA”) with Streeterville Capital, LLC (“Streeterville”) whereby the\nCompany issued two separate promissory notes of $5.4 million each with an initial rate of 7%. On March 10, 2022, the Company received $4.6 million in net\nfunds from the first tranche (Note 1) pursuant to a promissory note executed contemporaneously with the execution of the loan agreement. On June 29, 2022,\nthe Company received an additional $4.7 million in net funds from the second tranche (Note 2) pursuant to a promissory note. Each note has an 18-month\nmaturity, may be prepaid subject to varying prepayment premiums, and may be redeemed at any time after six months into the term of such note in amounts up\nto $0.5 million per calendar month upon the noteholder’s election. On January 11, 2023, the Company amended the promissory notes issued pursuant to the\nunsecured loan agreement with Streeterville whereby the noteholder agreed to waive their redemption rights through March 31, 2023, in exchange for a fee\nequal to 3.75% of the outstanding principal balance which increased the outstanding indebtedness due at maturity with Streeterville and increased the\nassociated debt issuance costs recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets by $0.4 million. On August 2, 2023, the Company entered into a\nForbearance Agreement with Streeterville which was subsequently amended on August 7, 2023. The Forbearance Agreement and amendment extended the\nmaturity dates for each Note by twelve months to September 2024 and December 2024. In consideration of the extension of the maturity dates, the Company\nentered into a Security Agreement with Streeterville, dated August 2, 2023 (the “Security Agreement”), under which Streeterville was granted a first-position\nsecurity interest in all assets of the Company.\nIn March 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Streeterville to exchange $0.2 million in principal for 52.2 thousand shares of common\nstock. Also in March 2024, the Company exchanged $9.3 million in Streeterville debt for 9.3 thousand shares of newly created Series A Preferred. The issuance\nof both common and preferred shares was made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements afforded by the Securities Act, as amended. The\ndesignations for the Series A Preferred preclude the Company from repaying any indebtedness for so long as any Series A Preferred shares are outstanding. The\nSeries A Preferred have a stated value of $1,100 per share and are subject to preferences and designations as more fully described in our Amended and Restated\nArticles of Incorporation filed on March 15, 2024, see also Note 6 Stockholders’ Equity. Following the exchanges noted herein, the remaining balance on Note\nOne was $0.5 million. The maturity date for Note One is September 2024 which conflicts with the Series A Preferred designation prohibiting repayment of any\nindebtedness.\n9\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023 the Company recorded $0.4 million of interest expense, respectively in the condensed consolidated\nstatement of operations associated with interest accretion and amortization of debt issue costs. As a result of exchanging $9.5 million principal in aggregate for\nequity, the Company reversed the interest accretion associated with the ability to stock-settle principal redemptions and wrote off the balance of unamortized\ndebt issuance costs of $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Simple interest of $0.2 million was incurred for both the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024, and 2023.\nScott Notes Payable\nDuring the period ended March 2024, the Company entered into two separate note purchase agreements with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer,\nAnthony Scott. On January 2, 2024, Scott purchased a note payable in the principal amount of $1.1 million in exchange for $1.0 million in cash. The note\ncalled for weekly payments of $40 thousand until maturity on June 15, 2024. Interest accrued on the balance of the note at 7% per annum compounding daily.\nDuring the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company made $0.2 million in principal payments on the first note payable.\nOn March 20, 2024, Scott purchased a second note payable in the principal amount of $343 thousand in exchange for $340 thousand in cash. The note\nwas non-interest bearing and matured on April 19, 2024. On April 2nd, the Company reduced the principal balance due under the note by $101 thousand which\nreflected the amount due from Scott for the exercise of common stock purchase warrants.\nOn March 31, 2024, the balance outstanding under both notes was $1.2 million. The Company recorded interest of $16 thousand for both notes in the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the period ended March 31, 2024. For the period ended March 31, 2024, $65 thousand in\namortization of debt issuance cost was recorded.\nOn April 19, 2024, Scott entered into a private placement subscription agreement to convert the aggregate outstanding balance of $1.1 million for both\nnotes in exchange for common stock and common stock purchase warrants. See Note 11 Subsequent Events for more information pertaining to the private\nplacement offering.\n10\n5. Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is periodically involved in various litigation claims asserted in the normal course of its business. The Company believes these actions are\nroutine and incidental to the business. While the outcome of these actions cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that any will have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Company’s business.\nStockholder Derivative Claim\nOn June 3, 2022, a verified stockholder derivative complaint was filed in U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (the “Court”) by the Plaintiff\nStockholder on behalf of Intrusion against certain of the Company’s Defendants. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants through various actions breached their\nfiduciary duties, wasted corporate assets, and unjustly enriched Defendants by (a) incurring costs and expenses in connection with the ongoing SEC\ninvestigation, (b) incurring costs and expenses to defend the Company with respect to the consolidated class action, (c) settling class-wide liability with respect\nto the consolidated class action, as well as ancillary claims regarding sales of the Company’s common stock by certain of the Defendants. On September 28,\n2023, the Company agreed to settle the claim. On October 2, 2023, public notice of the settlement was given. The settlement agreement provides in part for (i)\nan amendment to the Company’s Bylaws, committee Charters, and other applicable corporate policies to implement certain measures set forth more fully\ntherein, to remain in effect for no less than three years; (ii) attorneys’ fees and expenses to plaintiff’s counsel of $0.3 million; and (iii) the dismissal of all\nclaims against the Defendants, including the Company, in connection with the action. The $0.3 million settlement payment was made by the Company’s\ninsurance provider under its insurance policy since the Company’s $0.5 million retention was previously exhausted. On April 3, 2024, the Court approved the\nsettlement.\nIn addition to these legal proceedings, the Company is subject to various other claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company\ndoes not believe that any claims exist where the outcome of such matters would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated\nfinancial position, operating results, or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance such legal proceedings will not have a material impact on the\nCompany’s future results.\n6. Stockholder’s Equity\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nOn March 15, 2024, the Company filed a certificate of designation of preferences and rights (the “Certificate of Designation”) of Series A Preferred\nStock (the “Series A Stock”), with the Secretary of State of Delaware, designating 20,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 of the Company, as Series\nA Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Stock shall have a stated face value of $1,100.00 (“Stated Value”). The Series A Stock is not convertible into\ncommon shares of capital stock of the Company and as such is non-dilutive to current stockholders.\nEach share of Series A Stock shall accrue a rate of return on the Stated Value at the rate of 10% per year, compounded annually from the date of\nissuance and payable quarterly in cash or the issuance of additional shares of Series A Stock.\nCommencing on the one-year anniversary of the issuance date of each share of Series A Stock to the two-year anniversary, each share of Series A\nStock shall accrue an automatic quarterly dividend, calculated on the Stated Value at a rate of 2.5% per quarter. For all periods following the two-year\nanniversary of the issuance date of each share of Series A Stock, the quarterly dividend shall be 5%. The quarterly dividend shall be payable quarterly in cash\nor the issuance of additional shares of Series A Stock. In the event the Company is unable to pay the Quarterly Dividend of Preferred Return in cash and no\nremaining shares of Series A Stock are available for issuance, the Quarterly Dividend and Preferred Return will continue to accrue until such time the Company\ncan make payment. The Company classified the Series A Preferred Stock as equity as all events that could trigger redemption are fully within the Company’s\ncontrol.\nOn March 15, 2024, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with Streeterville Capital that exchanged $9.3 million in debt for 9,275 shares\nof newly created Series A Preferred Stock.\n11\nATM Offering\nB. Riley Securities, Inc. acts as sales agent for the Company’s ATM program, which allows the Company to potentially sell up to $50.0 million of the\nCompany’s common stock using a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed on August 5, 2021. On March 31, 2023, the date the Company filed its Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company became subject to the offering limits in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-\n3. As a result, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus relating to the registration of offerings under the program that reduced the amount\nthe Company may sell to aggregate proceeds of up to $15 million. For the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company received proceeds of approximately\n$0.5 million net of fees from the sale of common stock pursuant to the program. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has received proceeds of approximately\n$12.7 million net of fees from the sales of 613 thousand shares of common stock since the inception of the program.\nCommon Stock Warrants\nOn March 31, 2024, the Company had 60,641 warrants to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $104.40 and warrants to\npurchase 435,926 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $12.00.\n7. Revenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes product revenue upon shipment or after meeting certain performance obligations. These products can include hardware,\nsoftware subscriptions and consulting services. The Company also offers software on a subscription basis subject to software as a service (“SaaS”). Warranty\ncosts have not been material.\nThe Company recognizes sales of the Company’s datasets in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 606 whereby revenue from contracts with customers\nare recognized once the criteria under the five steps below have been met:\ni) identification of the contract with a customer;\nii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\niii) determination of the transaction price;\niv) allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance obligations; and\nv) recognize revenue upon satisfaction of a performance obligation.\n12\nConsulting services include reporting and are typically done monthly, and revenue is matched accordingly. Product sales may include maintenance and\ncustomer support allocated revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy\nusing the relative selling price method. All product offering and service offering market values are readily determined based on current and prior stand-alone\nsales. The Company defers and recognizes maintenance, updates, and support revenue over the term of the contract period, which is generally one year.\nNormal payment terms offered to customers, distributors and resellers are net 30 days domestically. The Company does not offer payment terms that\nextend beyond one year and rarely does it extend payment terms beyond its normal terms. If certain customers do not meet its credit standards, the Company\ntypically requires payment in advance to limit its credit exposure.\nWith the Company’s newest product, INTRUSION Shield, the Company began offering software on a subscription basis. INTRUSION Shield is a\nhosted arrangement subject to SaaS guidance under ASC 606. SaaS arrangements are accounted for as subscription services, not arrangements that transfer a\nlicense of intellectual property.\nThe Company utilizes the five-step process, mentioned above, per FASB ASC Topic 606 to recognize sales and will follow that directive, also, to\ndefine revenue items as individual and distinct. INTRUSION Shield services provided to its customers for a fixed monthly subscription fee include:\n· access to Intrusion’s proprietary software and database to detect and prevent unauthorized access to its clients’ information networks;\n· use of all software, associated media, printed materials, data, files, online documentation, and any equipment that Intrusion provides for customers\nto access the INTRUSION Shield; and\n· tech support, post contract customer support (PCS) includes daily program releases or corrections provided by Intrusion without additional charge.\nINTRUSION Shield contracts provide for no other services, and the Company’s customers have no rebates or return rights, nor are any such rights\nanticipated to be offered as part of this service.\nThe Company satisfies its performance obligation when the INTRUSION Shield solution is available to detect and prevent unauthorized access to a\nclient’s information networks. Revenue should be recognized monthly over the term of the contract. The Company’s standard initial contract terms\nautomatically renew unless notice is given 30 days before renewal. Upfront payment of fees is deferred and amortized into income over the period covered by\nthe contract.\nThe Company’s accounts receivable represents unconditional contract billings for sales per contracts with customers and are classified as current\nassets. As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had accounts receivable balances of $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively. As of\nMarch 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had an allowance for credit losses of $0.1 million.\nThe Company classifies its contract assets as receivables because the Company generally has an unconditional right to payment for the Company’s\nsales or services performed at the end of the reporting period.\nContract liabilities consist of cash payments in advance of the Company satisfying performance obligations and recognizing revenue. The Company\ncurrently classifies deferred revenue as a contract liability.\nThe following table presents changes in the Company’s contract liability during the period ended March 31, 2024, and the year ended December 31,\n2023 (in thousands):\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBalance at beginning of period $ 439 $ 455\nAdditions 1,565 4,727\nRevenue recognized (1,089) (4,743)\nBalance at end of period $ 915 $ 439\n13\n8. Capitalized Software Development\nThe Company capitalizes internally developed software using the Agile software development methodology which allows the Company to accurately\ntrack, and record costs associated with new software development and enhancements.\nPursuant to ASC Topic 350-40 Internal Use Software Accounting Capitalization, certain development costs related to the Company’s products during\nthe application development stage are capitalized as part of property and equipment. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as\nincurred. The preliminary stage includes such activities as conceptual formulation of alternatives, evaluation of alternatives, determination of existence of\nneeded technology, and the final selection of alternatives. Once the application development stage is reached, internal and external costs are capitalized until\nthe software is complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized internal use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life,\nwhich is generally three years.\n9. Net Loss Per Share\nThe Company reports two separate net loss per share numbers, basic and diluted. Basic net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is\ncomputed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the\nperiod. Diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the period\nby the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. The common stock equivalents include\nall common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants, options and vesting of restricted stock awards. The aggregate number of common stock\nequivalents excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation for the periods ended March 31, 2024, and 2023 totaled 183 and 46 thousand shares,\nrespectively. Since the Company is in a net loss position for the periods ended March 31, 2024, and 2023, basic and dilutive net loss per share is the same.\n10. Related Party Transactions\nOn January 2, 2024, the Company entered into an invoice financing arrangement pursuant to a note purchase agreement with Anthony Scott, President,\nand Chief Executive Officer of the Company (“Scott”), according to which, among other things, Scott purchased from the Company a promissory note (the\n“Promissory Note”) in the aggregate principal amount of $1.1 million in exchange for $1.0 million to the Company. Under the Promissory Note, the Company\nshall make Weekly Payments to Scott in the amount of $40 thousand per week. Interest accrues on the balance of the Promissory Note at a rate of 7.0% per\nannum, compounded daily. In connection with the issuance of the Promissory Note, the Company and Scott also entered into a security agreement, which\nprovides, according to its terms, a security interest in all accounts receivable or other receivables now existing or subsequently created prior to the payment of\nthe Promissory Note, subject to prior permitted liens.\nOn March 20, 2024, the Company entered into an additional invoice financing arrangement pursuant to a note purchase agreement with Scott,\naccording to which, among other things, Scott purchased from the Company a second Promissory Note 2 in the aggregate principal amount of $343 thousand in\nexchange for $340 thousand to the Company. The Promissory Note 2 is non-interest bearing and matures on April 19, 2024.\nSee additional discussion regarding these transactions that occurred subsequent to March 31, 2024, below.\n14\n11. Subsequent Events\nOn April 3, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Streeterville to exchange 91 shares of Series A Preferred Stock with an aggregate stated\nvalue of $100 thousand for 32.2 thousand shares of common stock. The issuance of the exchange shares is pursuant to the exemption from the registration\nrequirements afforded by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nOn April 1, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved entry into an inducement letter that provides, during the period beginning on April 2,\n2024 and continuing through April 23, 2024, for the lowering of the exercise price of all outstanding warrants and, for each share of common stock exercised\nunder the Warrants, providing the participating Warrant holder with a New Warrant for that same number of shares of common stock. The reduced exercise\nprice of the Warrants is $3.04, which includes $0.13 per share that is attributable to the purchase price of the New Warrant. The New Warrant exercise price is\n$2.91 with an exercise period of five years. On April 8, 2024, certain holders of the Warrants exercised 181 thousand shares of the Company’s common stock\nresulting in gross proceeds of $0.6 million and the issuance of 186.5 thousand New Warrants. The issuance of New Warrants was undertaken pursuant to the\nexemption from registration provided in Rule 506(b) under Regulation D pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nOn April 22, 2024, entered into a private placement subscription agreement pursuant to which the Company sold to purchasers in an Offering an\naggregate of 1.3 million shares of its common stock, each of which is coupled with a warrant to purchase two shares of common stock at an aggregate offering\nprice of $1.95 per share. None of the shares of common stock or shares underlying the warrants have been registered for resale under the Securities Act of 1933\nas amended. The Company received gross proceeds of approximately $2.6 million from this private placement subscription.\nOn April 22, 2024, the Company announced that the Company believes it has stockholders’ equity above the $2.5 million requirement to regain\ncompliance with the Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) as a result of the Offering, along with proceeds received from the warrant exercise inducement letters.\nThe Company provided an update to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel on how it plans to maintain long-term compliance with the Equity Rule. On May 1, 2024, the\nCompany received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Staff of the Nasdaq informing that it has regained compliance with the minimum bid price\nand equity requirements with the Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5550(b)(1).\n15\nItem 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including, without limitation, the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations,” contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities\nAct\"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties.\nAll statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our financial position;\nour ability to continue our business as a going concern; our business, sales, and marketing strategies and plans; our ability to successfully market, sell, and\ndeliver our INTRUSION Shield commercial product and solutions to an expanding customer base; and our ability to secure additional financing; are forward-\nlooking statements.

After many years of gathering intelligence and providing our INTRUSION TraceCop and Savant solutions\nexclusively to government entities, we released our first commercial product in 2021, the INTRUSION Shield. INTRUSION Shield was designed to allow\nbusinesses to incorporate a Zero Trust, reputation-based security solution into their existing infrastructure to observe traffic flow and instantly block known\nmalicious or unknown connections from both entering or exiting a network, making it an ideal solution for protecting from Zero-Day and ransomware attacks.\nAs discussed in more detail below on March 31, 2024, we had $0.1 million in cash. Subsequent to March 31, 2024, we raised $5.7 million in net\nproceeds through the issuance of common stock using our ATM program, a private placement offering and the exercise of warrants resulting from a warrant\ninducement offering. As of May 10, 2024, we had $2.4 million in cash. If we are not able to raise adequate funds under the Company’s ATM program or obtain\nadditional equity financing, the Company may be unable to implement the Company’s business plan, fund its liquidity needs or even continue its operations.\n16\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Periods ended March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023\nThree Months\nEnded March 31, Change\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 Dollar Percentage\nRevenue $ 1,131 $ 1,309 $ (178) -13.6%\nCost of Revenue 226 313 (87) -27.8%\nGross Profit 905 996 91 -9.1%\nOperating Expenses:\nSales and marketing 1,177 1,738 (561) -32.3%\nResearch and development 1,019 1,796 (777) -43.3%\nGeneral and administrative 1,181 1,506 (325) -21.6%\nOperating Loss (2,472) (4,044) 1,572 38.9%\nInterest Expense (228) (285) 57 20.0%\nInterest Accretion and Debt Issuance Costs, Net 990 (446) 1,436 322.0%\nOther (Expense) Income, Net (6) 41 (47) -114.6%\nNet Loss $ (1,716) $ (4,734) $ 3,018 63.8%\nRevenues. Revenue for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, was $1.1 million compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2023.\nRevenue from consulting totaled $0.7 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to $1.0 million for the three-month period ended\nMarch 31, 2023. The continuing resolution and delay in the approval of a federal budget for the 2024 year which did not occur until March 22, 2024, impacted\nrenewals and task orders received for long-standing contracts which resulted in a decline in consulting revenues. We will continue to pursue new consulting\nopportunities and expect to see an increase in consulting revenues beginning in the second quarter of 2024. INTRUSION Shield revenues were $0.4 million\nfor the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, compared to $0.3 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. We have begun to see some\ntraction in INTRUSION Shield sales with the recent addition of seven new logos and the award of a large contract for the Philippine national elections. These\nnew customers will begin to contribute to revenues more meaningfully in the second half of 2024. We have also been informed by a large early INTRUSION\nShield customer that they will not be renewing their INTRUSION Shield contract. The customer was one of the original users of an early version of the\nINTRUSION Shield product and had implemented a highly customized and non-standard configuration of the product. We believe that the INTRUSION\nShield transactions booked in the fourth quarter of 2023 and during the first quarter of 2024 and the several transactions that we anticipate will close in the\nsecond quarter of this year will offset this loss and help drive INTRUSION Shield revenue growth in 2024.\nConcentration of Revenues. Revenues from sales to various U.S. government entities totaled $0.7 million, or 58.6% of revenues, for the quarter\nended March 31, 2024, compared to $0.6 million, or 48.4% of revenues, for the same period in 2023. Although we expect our concentration of revenues to vary\namong customers in future periods depending upon the timing of certain sales, we anticipate that sales to government customers will continue to account for a\nsignificant portion of our revenues in future periods. Sales to the government present risks in addition to those involved in sales to commercial customers\nwhich could adversely affect our revenues, including, without limitation, potential disruption to appropriation and spending patterns and the government’s\nreservation of the right to cancel contracts and purchase orders for its convenience. Although we do not anticipate that any of our revenues from government\ncustomers will be renegotiated, cancelled or renegotiated government orders could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. The Company has\none commercial customer in the first quarter of 2024 that accounted for 30.0% of total revenue. This customer has chosen not to renew their INTRUSION\nShield contract. There were two customers accounting for 46.6% of total revenue for the same three-month period in 2023. The Company’s similar product and\nservice offerings are not viewed as individual segments, as its management analyzes the business as a whole and expenses are not allocated to each product\noffering.\n17\nGross Profit. Gross profit was $0.9 million or 80.0% of revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $1.0 million or 76.1% of\nrevenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The increased gross profit margin is a result of a change in product mix with INTRUSION Shield revenues\nrepresenting 38.5% of our revenue mix compared to 27.3% in the same period 2023.\nOperating Expenses. Operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, totaled $3.4 million, a 33.0% decrease when compared to $5.0\nmillion for the same period in 2023. The decrease was most notably due to a reduction in staffing and contract labor expenses which totaled $1.1 million in\naddition to reduced spend on sales and marketing of $0.2 million and reduced litigation defense costs of $0.1 million.\nIn late March 2023 we implemented cost reduction measures that resulted in the reduction of sixteen permanent positions, the reduced use of\ncontractors and renegotiating or replacing spend on certain sales support and marketing services with less costly programs. Headcount on March 31, 2024, was\nforty-nine compared to sixty-six for the 2023 period when adjusted for the reductions that took place in late March 2023. Many of the reductions were in\nResearch and Development, which will impact the number and frequency of product releases. As we grow our customer base and increase our revenues, we\nmay choose to accelerate our product development in future periods, which would result in increased spending.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $1.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $1.7 million for the\nquarter ended March 31, 2023. The 2024 period includes approximately $0.2 million in one-time negotiated contract savings. When adjusted for these one-time\nsavings, the first quarter 2024 expense is more representative of the anticipated spend going forward although, certain discretionary spend, inclusive of\nparticipation in trade shows, utilization of third-party contractors for content and product messaging and travel, are likely to vary over time based on savings\ninitiatives that may be necessary.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses totaled $1.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, an $0.8 million decrease\ncompared to the same period in 2023. The savings are a result of cost reduction measures implemented in late March 2023 which included the reduction of 13\nFTEs and the reduced use of contractors. Research and development costs may vary over time as we determine the frequency of new releases, improved\nfunctionality and enhancements needed to be competitive with our product offering.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses totaled $1.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $1.5\nmillion for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The reduction is primarily due to one-time negotiated cost savings of $0.1 million and legal defense costs\nincurred in the 2023 period of $0.1 million for matters that have since been settled.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for the period March 31, 2024 was $0.2 million consisting principally of the stated interest related to the\nStreeterville notes, interest associated with the note’s payable issued to Scott, our CEO and finance leases. Interest expense for the period March 31, 2023 was\n$0.3 million. Interest expense will vary in the future based on our cash flow and borrowing needs.\nInterest Accretion and Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs. During the March 2024 quarter, the Company entered into exchange agreements to\nconvert $9.5 million in Streeterville debt to $9.3 million of Series A preferred stock and $0.2 million to common stock and, as a result, the Company reversed\nthe interest accretion associated with the ability to stock-settle principal redemptions and wrote-off the remaining deferred debt issue costs resulting in a net\ncredit to interest expense of $1.0 million. For the March 2023 quarter, the interest accretion and amortization of debt issuance costs was $0.4 million.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net. Other income and expense were nominal amounts for both the periods ended March 31, 2024, and 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $0.1 million and a working capital deficit of $(4.7) million. Subsequent to March 31, 2024,\nwe raised $5.7 million in net proceeds through the issuance of common stock using our ATM program, a private placement and a warrant inducement offering.\nAs of May 10, 2024, we had $2.4 million in cash. Management plans to fund the operations of the Company through the continued use of the ATM and or\nadditional equity financings. If the Company is not able to raise adequate funds, the Company may be unable to implement the Company’s business plan, fund\nits liquidity needs or even continue its operations.\n18\nSources of Liquidity\nOur principal sources of cash for funding operations in the March 2024 quarter was through the issuance of notes payable to Scott of $1.3 million and\nthe issuance of common stock using the Company’s ATM program which provided $0.5 million. Our principal source of cash for funding operations in 2023\nwas through changes in working capital which consisted principally of $1.4 million in Employee Retention Tax Credit refunds recorded in 2022.\nAt-The-Market Program\nB. Riley Securities, Inc. acts as sales agent under the Company’s at-the-market program, which allowed us to potentially sell up to $50.0 million of its\ncommon stock using the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed on August 5, 2021. On April 11, 2023, Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 and in agreement\nwith the terms of the sales agreement, the company revised the aggregate offering price of shares of common stock that we can sell pursuant to the ATM\nprogram to $15 million. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we received $0.5 million, net of fees for sales of common stock were made pursuant to the\nprogram. As of March 31, 2024, the remaining aggregate offering price of shares of common stock that we can sell pursuant to the ATM program based on\ngross proceeds was $9.6 million.\nNotes Payable\nIn March 2024, we entered into an agreement with Streeterville to exchange $0.2 million in principal for 52.2 thousand shares of common stock. Also\nin March 2024, we exchanged $9.3 million in Streeterville debt for 9,275 shares of our newly created Series A Preferred. The issuance of both common and\npreferred shares was made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements afforded by the Securities Act, as amended. The designations for the\nSeries A Preferred preclude the Company from repaying any indebtedness for so long as any Series A Preferred shares are outstanding. The Series A Preferred\nhave a stated value of $1,100 per share and are subject to preferences and designations as more fully described in our Amended and Restated Articles of\nIncorporation filed on March 15, 2024. Following the exchanges noted herein, the remaining balance on Note One was $0.5 million. The maturity date for Note\nOne is September 2024 which conflicts with the Series A Preferred designation prohibiting repayment of any indebtedness. We are in discussions with\nStreeterville to modify the terms of the Note One agreement.\nDuring the March 2024 quarter we entered into two separate note purchase agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Scott. On January 2,\n2024, Scott purchased a note payable in the principal amount of $1.1 million in exchange for $1.0 million in cash. The note called for weekly payments of\n$40,000 until maturity on June 15, 2024. Interest accrued on the balance of the note at 7% per annum compounding daily. During the quarter we made $200\nthousand in principal payments, on March 31, 2024, the balance outstanding under this note was $0.9 million.\nOn March 20, 2024, Scott purchased a second note payable in the principal amount of $343 thousand in exchange for $340 thousand in cash. The note\nwas non-interest bearing and matured on April 19, 2024. On April 2nd, we reduced the principal balance due under the note by $101 thousand which reflected\nthe amount due from Scott for the exercise of common stock purchase warrants.\nOn April 19, 2024, Scott entered into a private placement subscription agreement to convert the aggregate outstanding balance of $1.1 million for both\nnotes in exchange for common stock and common stock purchase warrants. See Note 11 Subsequent Events for more information pertaining to the private\nplacement offering.\n19\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nOur cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023 were:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (1,114) $ (2,312)\nNet cash used in investing activities (427) (301)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 1,524 9\nChange in cash and cash equivalents $ (17) $ (2,604)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was ($1.1) million due to a net loss of ($1.7) million offset partially by changes in\nworking capital which consisted principally of reductions in prepaid expenses.\nNet cash used in operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, was ($2.3) million due primarily to a net loss of ($4.7) million partially offset by 1)\nadjustments for non-cash items of $1.2 million which are mostly comprised of depreciation, stock-based compensation and changes in working capital of\ninterest related to Streeterville notes, and 2) changes in working capital of $1.2 million consisting principally of the cash receipt of amounts due relating to\nEmployee Retention Credit.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $0.4 million, which was comprised of capitalization of internally\ndeveloped software and hardware purchases. Net cash used by investing activities, for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was $0.3 million principally for\ncapitalization of internally developed software.\nFinancing Activities\nFor three months ended March 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $1.5 million compared to $0.0 million in the March 2023 period\nwhich was primarily the result of net proceeds from issuance of the Scott notes $1.1 million and at-the-market program public offerings of $0.5 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related\ndisclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We\nevaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences\nbetween these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nWe believe the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, reflect our more\nsignificant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes to our\ncritical accounting policies and estimates as filed in such report.\n20\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable.\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive\nofficer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply our reasonable judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of\npotential disclosure controls and procedures.\nAs of March 31, 2024, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the\ndesign and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2024.\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n21\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nStockholder Derivative Claim\nOn June 3, 2022, a stockholder derivative complaint was filed in U.S. District Court, District of Delaware the Court by the Plaintiff Stockholder on\nbehalf of Intrusion against Defendants. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants through various actions breached their fiduciary duties, wasted corporate assets, and\nunjustly enriched Defendants by (a) incurring costs and expenses in connection with the ongoing SEC investigation, (b) incurring costs and expenses to defend\nus with respect to the consolidated class action, (c) settling class-wide liability with respect to the consolidated class action, as well as ancillary claims\nregarding sales of our common stock by certain of the Defendants. On September 28, 2023, we agreed to settle the claim. On October 2, 2023, public notice of\nthe settlement agreement was given. The settlement agreement provides in part for (i) an amendment to our Bylaws, committee Charters, and other applicable\ncorporate policies to implement certain measures set forth more fully therein, to remain in effect for no less than three years; (ii) attorneys’ fees and expenses to\nplaintiff’s counsel of $0.3 million; and (iii) the dismissal of all claims against the Defendants, including the Company, in connection with the action. The $0.3\nmillion settlement payment was made by our insurance provider under our insurance policy since our $0.5 million retention was previously exhausted. On\nApril 3, 2024, the Court approved the settlement.\nIn addition to these legal proceedings, we are subject to various other claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that\nany claims exist where the outcome of such matters would have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial position, operating results, or\ncash flows. However, there can be no assurance such legal proceedings will not have a material impact on our future results.\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the risk factor set forth below, you should carefully\nconsider the risk factors we previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, as of and for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 (the “Annual Report”). These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash\nflows. However, these risks are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial\nalso may impair our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nItem 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES USE OF PROCEEDS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nOn March 7, 2024, we agreed to exchange $0.2 million in aggregate principal on Streeterville Note 1 for fifty-two thousand shares of our common\nstock.

All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including statements regarding our\nfinancial position; our ability to continue our business as a going concern; our business, sales, and marketing strategies and plans; our ability to successfully\nmarket, sell, and deliver our INTRUSION Shield commercial product and solutions to an expanding customer base; are forward-looking statements. In some\ncases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,”\n“expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” or “would” or the negative of these words or other similar terms\nor expressions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include, but are not limited to, such statements.\nYou should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and operating results. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other\nfactors described in the section titled \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on\ninformation available to us as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe that such information provides a reasonable basis for these\nstatements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or\nreview of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements.\nThe forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We\nundertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect events or circumstances after the date of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.\nEXPLANATORY NOTE – REVERSE STOCK SPLIT\nUnless otherwise stated, all shares and per share amounts for all periods presented in this Annual Report have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-20 reverse stock\nsplit we effected on March 22, 2024.\nii\nPART I\nItem 1. Business.\nOur Corporate Information\nWe were organized in Texas in September 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in October 1995. Our principal executive offices are located at 101\nEast Park Boulevard, Suite 1200, Plano, Texas 75074, and our telephone number is (972) 234-6400. Our website URL is www.intrusion.com. We post the\nfollowing filings in the “Investors” section of our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities\nand Exchange Commission: our Annual Reports on Form 10-K; our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q; our current reports on Form 8-K; and any amendments to\nthose reports or statements filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. All such filings on our website are available free of\ncharge. Additionally, filings are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website (www.sec.gov). In this report, references to the “Company,”\n“we”, “us,” “our”, “Intrusion” or “Intrusion Inc.” refer to Intrusion Inc. and its subsidiaries. TraceCop and Savant are registered trademarks of the Company.\nWe have also applied for trademark protection for INTRUSION Shield.\nOur Business\nIntrusion, Inc. is a cybersecurity company based in Plano, Texas. The company offers its customers access to its exclusive threat intelligence database\ncontaining the historical data, known associations, and reputational behavior of over 8.5 billion Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses. After years of gathering\nglobal internet intelligence and working exclusively with government entities, the company released its first commercial product in 2021.\nFor the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, we generated revenues of approximately $5.6 million and $7.5 million, respectively, and\nreported net loss of approximately $13.9 million and $16.2 million, respectively, and cash flow used in operating activities of approximately $7.8 million and\n$13.2 million, respectively. As noted in our audited financial statements, as of December 31, 2023, we had stockholders’ deficit of $9.6 million and a working\ncapital deficit of $13.1 million. As a result of our historical recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations, net working capital\ndeficiency as well as our dependence on equity and debt financings, there is a substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur Solutions\nINTRUSION Shield™\nINTRUSION Shield, our newest cybersecurity solution is a Zero Trust reputation-based Software as a Service (“SaaS”) solution that inspects and\nkills dangerous network (in and outbound) connections. What makes our approach unique is that INTRUSION Shield evaluates every packet and analyzes the\nIP addresses (source and destination), as well as domain information and the ports utilized and, when combined with other threat intelligence data reports,\nblocks malicious connections. Many breaches today are caused by Zero-Day and malware free compromises that may not trigger alarms in a traditional firewall\nor endpoint solution. INTRUSION Shield’s capabilities are designed to continuously evolve as the threats and landscape change over time. Unlike traditional\nindustry approaches that rely heavily on signatures, complex rules, and human factors mitigation, which malicious actors and nation states have learned to\nbypass, INTRUSION Shield’s proprietary architecture isolates and neutralizes malicious traffic and network flows that existing solutions are ill equipped to\nhandle.\nIn September 2022, we expanded the INTRUSION Shield product line to include the Shield Cloud and Shield End-Point solutions. The initial\nINTRUSION Shield offering released in early 2021, the Shield On-Premise solution, utilizes hardware and is placed behind a firewall in a data center. Shield\nCloud extends the effectiveness of the Shield On-Premise solution to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), SaaS and serverless\nresources in the public cloud. This product serves as a protective gateway to the cloud, providing both Zero Trust access to, and protecting outbound\nconnections from, virtual hosts and serverless functions within the cloud. Shield Endpoint helps protect the network outside of the corporate enclave and data\ncenter to include protection for remote workers, mobile, and cloud devices. This product brings the network protection of the Shield On-Premise to these\nremote user devices establishing a Zero Trust network, both for intra-organization connectivity and external internet connectivity.\n1\nINTRUSION TraceCop®\nINTRUSION TraceCop is a big data tool with extensive IP intelligence canvassing the entire internet. It contains what we believe to be the largest\nexisting repository of reputation information on known good and known bad active IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6). TraceCop contains an inventory of\nnetwork selectors and enrichments useful to support forensic investigations. The data contains a history of IPv4 and IPv6 block allocations and transfers,\nhistorical mappings of IP addresses to Autonomous Systems (ASNs) as observed through BGP, and approximately one billion historically registered domain\nnames and registration context. TraceCop contains tens of billions of historic DNS resolutions of Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs or hostnames) on\neach of these domains. Together, the resulting data shows relationships, hosting, and attribution for internet resources. TraceCop also contains web server\nsurveys of content, such as natural language and topic of the content on hundreds of millions of websites and servers and OS fingerprints of services showing\napplications running on a given IP address. TraceCop also contains a history of threat and reputation for each hostname and IP address over time. All these\nfeatures combine to create a very effective network forensics and cybersecurity analysis tool.\nINTRUSION Savant®\nINTRUSION Savant is a network monitoring solution that leverages the rich data available in TraceCop to identify suspicious traffic in real-time.\nSavant uses several original patents to uniquely characterize and record all network flows. Savant is a network reconnaissance and attack analysis tool used by\nforensic analysts in United States (“U.S.”) government agencies and corporations with in-house threat research teams. For example, Savant users can create\nvarious automated rules to inspect packets matching (or not) certain criteria such as creating a rule to ensure the Source MAC address field in the Ethernet\nheader and Source IP address from the IP header are always the same, failing which could indicate MAC or IP Spoofing in progress. Similarly, threat\ninvestigators can create rules using regular expressions to analyze multiple fields in the packet headers.\nOur Intellectual Property and Licenses\nOur success and our ability to compete are primarily dependent upon our proprietary technology. We principally rely on a combination of contractual\nrights, trade secrets and copyright laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our solutions. In addition, we have received two patents, and we have\napplied for patents for our INTRUSION Shield family of solutions. We have also entered into non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers, resellers, and\ncertain customers to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual\nproperty will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are\nsubstantially equivalent or superior to our technology, although it would be extremely difficult to replicate the proprietary and comprehensive internet\ndatabases we have developed over the past 25+ years.\nWe have entered into software and solution license agreements with various suppliers. These license agreements provide us with additional software\nand hardware components that add value to our cybersecurity solutions. These license agreements do not provide proprietary rights that are unique or exclusive\nto us and are generally available to other parties on the same or similar terms and conditions, subject to payment of applicable license fees and royalties. We do\nnot consider any of the solution license, software, or supplier agreements to be material to our business, instead, they are complementary to our business and\nofferings.\nOur Competition\nThe market for network and data protection security solutions is intensely competitive and subject to frequent introductions of new technologies, and\npotentially improved price and performance characteristics. Industry suppliers compete in areas such as conformity to existing and emerging industry\nstandards, interoperability with networking and other cybersecurity solutions, management and security capabilities, performance, price, ease of use,\nscalability, reliability, flexibility, features, and technical support. Our principal competitors in the data mining and advanced persistent threat market include\nDarktrace, Trellix, and Recorded Futures.\n2\nThere are numerous companies competing in various segments of the data security market. At this time, we have little or no competitors for\nTraceCop; however, we believe competitors could emerge in the future. These competitors currently perform only a portion of the functions that we can\nperform with TraceCop. We have been continuously collecting the TraceCop data for more than twenty years, and we believe that none of our current or future\ncompetitors will have the ability to provide and reference this historical data. In our newest market segment, data mining and advanced persistent threat\ndetection, we compete directly and indirectly with companies and open-source technologies in the firewall, intrusion detection and prevention, anti-virus,\nnetwork analysis, endpoint protection, and insider threat prevention areas of cybersecurity technology.\nWe believe the INTRUSION Shield product line is novel and unique in our industry because of our proprietary threat-enriched big data. We believe\nthat our INTRUSION Shield family of solutions complement our customer’s existing cybersecurity processes and third-party solutions. If the INTRUSION\nShield receives widespread acceptance in the market, we anticipate that other businesses will seek to compete with INTRUSION Shield; however, we believe\nour existing, mature, and proprietary database which is integral to the operation of INTRUSION Shield will be difficult, if not impossible, for other companies\nin our industry to replicate and will be a significant barrier to entry of competitors in the near- and long-term future of cyber security solutions.\nOur Customers: Government Sales\nSales to U.S. government customers accounted for 46.2% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 65.8% of our revenue\nin 2022. We expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to governmental entities in the future as we continue to market our\nproducts and data mining products to the government, and we intend to market INTRUSION Shield not only to our long-standing governmental customer base\nbut to expand our efforts to include more traditionally administrative and civilian governmental entities. Sales to government clients present risks in addition to\nthose involved in sales to commercial customers that could adversely affect our revenues, including potential disruption due to irregularities in or interruptions\nto appropriation and spending patterns, delays in approving a federal budget and the government’s reservation of the right to cancel contracts and purchase\norders for its convenience.\nWe make our sales under purchase orders and contracts. Our customers, including government customers, may cancel their orders or contracts with\nlittle or no prior notice and without penalty. Although we transact business with various government entities, we believe that the cancellation of any order in\nitself could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Because we derive and expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from\nsales to government entities, a large number of cancelled or renegotiated government orders or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial\nresults.\nThird-Party Products\nWe currently utilize commercially available computers and servers from various vendors which we integrate with our software products for\nimplementation into our customer networks. We do not consider any of these third party relationships to be material to the Company’s business or results of\noperations.\nCustomer Services\nOur solutions may include installation, operation of our technology and threat data interpretation and reporting.\nSales, Marketing and Customers\nField Sales Force. Our sales organization focuses on major account sales, channel partners including distributors, value added resellers (“VARs”) and\nintegrators; promotes our solutions to current and potential customers; and monitors evolving customer requirements. The field sales and technical support\nforce provides training and technical support to our resellers and end users and assists our customers in designing cyber secure data networking solutions. We\ncurrently conduct sales and marketing efforts from our principal office in Plano, Texas.\n3\nResellers. Resellers such as domestic and international system integrators and VARs sell our solutions as stand-alone solutions to end users and\nintegrate our solutions with products sold by other vendors into network security systems that are sold to end users. Our field sales force and technical support\norganization provide support to these resellers. Our agreements with resellers are non-exclusive, and our resellers generally sell other products and solutions\nthat may compete with our solutions. Resellers may place higher priority on products or solutions of other suppliers who are larger and have more name\nrecognition, and there can be no assurance that resellers will continue to sell and support our solutions.\nForeign Sales. Export sales did not account for any revenue in 2023 and 2022.\nMarketing. We have implemented several methods to market our solutions, including participation in trade shows and seminars, distribution of sales\nliterature and solution specifications and ongoing communication with our resellers and installed base of end-user customers.\nCustomers. Our end-user customers include U.S. federal government, state and local government entities, large and diversified conglomerates, and\nmanufacturing entities. Sales to certain customers and groups of customers can be impacted by seasonal capital expenditure approval cycles, and sales to\ncustomers within certain geographic regions can be subject to seasonal fluctuations in demand.\nIn 2023, 46.2% of our revenue was derived from a variety of U.S. government entities through direct sales and indirectly through system integrators\nand resellers. These sales are attributable to six U.S. Government customers through direct and indirect channels; two U.S. government customers individually\nexceeded 10% of total revenue in 2023. A reduction in our sales to U.S. government entities could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating\nresults if not replaced.\nBacklog. We believe that only a small portion of our order backlog is non-cancelable, and that the dollar amount associated with the non-cancelable\nportion is immaterial. Commercial orders are generally fulfilled within two days to two weeks following receipt of an order. Certain orders may be scheduled\nover several months, generally not exceeding one year.\nCustomer Support, Service and Warranty. We service, repair, and provide technical support for our solutions. Our field sales and technical support\nforce works closely with resellers and end-user customers on-site and by telephone to assist with pre- and post- sales support services such as network security\ndesign, system installation and technical consulting. By working closely with our customers, our employees increase their understanding of end-user\nrequirements and are then able to provide specific input in our solution development process.\nWe warrant all our solutions against defects during the service period. Before and after expiration of the solution warranty period, we offer both on-\nsite and factory-based support, parts replacement, and repair services. Extended warranty services are separately invoiced on a time and materials basis or\nunder an annual maintenance contract.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed a total of forty-nine persons, five of which are part time. None of our employees are represented by a labor\norganization, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. Competition in the recruiting of personnel in the networking and data security\nindustry is intense. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire, motivate and retain qualified management, sales,\nmarketing, and technical personnel.\n4\nOur Code of Conduct\nThe Company’s directors and employees are required to abide by the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which the Company adopted\non September 14, 2020, as amended on March 16, 2022 (the “Code”) to ensure that the Company’s business is conducted in a consistently legal and ethical\nmanner and to avoid instances of insider trading. The Code covers areas of professional conduct that include conflicts of interest, fair dealing and the strict\nadherence to all laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of the Company’s business.\nThe full text of the amended Code is published on the Company’s website under the investor relations tab at www.intrusion.com. The Company\nintends to disclose future amendments to, or waivers from, certain provisions of the Codes of Ethics on the Company’s website within four business days\nfollowing the date of such amendment or waiver. Upon the written request of any stockholder, the Company will furnish, without charge, a copy of the Code.\nThis request should be directed to the Company’s Secretary at 101 East Park Blvd., Suite 1200, Plano, TX 75074.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn March 22, 2024, we effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of our common stock. All share and per share amounts set forth in the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the split effected in March 2024 as if it had occurred as of the earliest period presented and\nunless otherwise stated, all other share and per share amounts for all periods presented in this Annual Report have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock\nsplit effected in March 2024.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following are the significant factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results, as well as\nadversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Risks and uncertainties\nnot currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nRisks Related to our Financial Position and Liquidity\nThe Company’s ability to implement its current business plan is dependent on our ability to raise additional funds through additional public or private\nfinancings, which raises substantial doubt that the Company may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $139 thousand and negative working capital of $13.1 million. Our primary source of\ncash for funding operations in 2023 has come from net proceeds received from a private offering of our common stock and warrants and net proceeds received\nfrom our at-the-market (“ATM”) program in an aggregate amount of approximately $7.0 million. To finance our operations and to continue as a going concern,\nwe believe it will be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings, including the utilization of our ATM program. We can\nprovide no assurances that we will be able to raise additional funds through any future equity or debt financings, and the terms of those financings, if available\nat all, may be on terms, which are not favorable to us and, in the case of equity financings, will result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe are subject to certain contractual and regulatory limitations on our ability to consummate future financings.\nPursuant to that certain securities purchase agreements we entered into in March 2022 with Streeterville Capital, LLC and related issuance of two\npromissory notes, we agreed to be subject to certain restrictions on our ability to issue securities during the term of the notes issued under the agreement.\nSpecifically, we agreed to obtain Streeterville Capital’s consent prior to issuing any debt securities or certain equity securities where the pricing of such equity\nsecurities is tied to the public trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, we also must offer Streeterville the right to purchase up to 10% of future equity\nand debt securities offerings, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, in each case during the term of any note issued to Streeterville.\nFurthermore, unless our public float exceeds $75 million, we will be subject to the restrictions set forth in General Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3 that\nlimit our ability to conduct primary offerings under a Form S-3 registration statement. Under such limitations, we may not sell, during any 12-month period,\nsecurities on Form S-3 having an aggregate market value of more than one-third of our public float. As of March 25, 2024, our public float calculated in\naccordance with General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 was $6.8 million. These restrictions may delay or prevent us from entering into funding arrangements or\nbeing able to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all.\n5\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our March 2022 securities purchase agreement, there could be an event of default under the\nnotes issued thereunder, which could result in an acceleration of payments due under those notes and other consequences.\nFailure to meet the restrictions, obligations, and limitations under the March 2022 securities purchase agreement may result in an event of default in\naccordance with the terms of the notes issued thereunder. An event of default would, among other things, provide the noteholder with the right to increase the\noutstanding balance by 15% for certain major events of default and 5% for others. Additionally, upon an event of default, the noteholder may consider the note\nimmediately due and payable. Furthermore, upon an event of default, the interest rate may also be increased to the lesser of 18% per annum or the maximum\nrate permitted under applicable law.\nWe must increase revenue levels in order to finance our current operations and to implement our business strategies.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we had a net loss of $13.9 million and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $110.2 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023. We need to increase current revenue levels from the sales of our solutions if we are to regain profitability, and our new INTRUSION\nShield suite of products may take time to achieve market penetration which could negatively impact future revenues and results of operations. If we are unable\nto increase revenue levels, losses could continue for the near term and possibly longer, and we may not regain profitability or be able to implement our business\nplan, fund our liquidity needs, or continue our operations.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nMost of our current revenues are generated from one family of solutions with a limited number of customers, and the decrease of revenue from sales of\nthis family of solutions could materially harm our business and prospects.\nApproximately 66.4% of our existing revenues result from sales of TraceCop a cybersecurity solution. TraceCop revenues were $3.7 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, compared to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. We can offer no assurances that our new INTRUSION\nShield solution will reduce our dependence on this single solution and in the absence of a shift in solution mix, we may continue to face risks if sales of this\nkey solution to these limited customers were to decrease.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to broaden the marketing and sale of the INTRUSION Shield.\nWe believe that we must expand our sales and marketing efforts for INTRUSION Shield to achieve marketplace acceptance and to generate revenue\nfor the Company. However, these efforts depend, in large part, on the success of our channel partners as they market and sell INTRUSION Shield, which may\nnot be successful. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to leverage channel and strategic partners, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from\nINTRUSION Shield to improve the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flow position.\nThe current geo-political climate may add uncertainty in the dealings of our customers and could cause them to delay indefinitely certain cybersecurity\ninitiatives or to determine not to introduce or implement any new or innovative cyber-solution products into their information networks.\nContinuing events in many regions around the world have introduced a significant level of uncertainty in the dealings of our current and potential\ncustomers that could cause them to be hesitant to implement new cybersecurity initiatives regardless of the efficacy of our INTRUSION Shield product.\nFurther, these entities may also determine not to deploy their cash reserves in the face of such uncertainty. These uncertainties could depress the interest or the\nability of companies and governmental entities to test, evaluate, and deploy our INTRUSION Shield in their network environments.\n6\nA large percentage of our current revenues are received from U.S. government entities, and the loss of these customers or our failure to widen the scope of\nour customer base to include general commercial enterprises could negatively affect our revenues.\nA substantial percentage of our current revenues result from sales to U.S. government entities. If we were to lose one or more of these customers, our revenues\ncould decline, and our business and prospects may be materially harmed. Further, sales to the government present risks in addition to those involved in sales to\ncommercial customers, including potential disruption due to appropriation and spending patterns, delays in approving a federal budget and the government’s\nright to cancel contracts and purchase orders for its convenience. The factors that could cause us to lose these U.S. government customers or otherwise\nmaterially harm our business, prospects, financial condition, or results of operations include:\n· budget constraints affecting government spending generally, or specific departments or agencies, and changes in fiscal policies or a reduction of\navailable funding;\n· re-allocation of government resources;\n· disruptions in our customers’ ability to access funding from capital markets;\n· curtailment of governments’ use of outsourced service providers and governments’ in-sourcing of certain services;\n· the adoption of new laws or regulations pertaining to government procurement;\n· government appropriations delays or blanket reductions in departmental budgets;\n· suspension or prohibition from contracting with the government or any significant agency with which we conduct business;\n· increased use of shorter duration awards, which increases the frequency we may need to recompete for work;\n· impairment of our reputation or relationships with any significant government agency with which we conduct business;\n· decreased use of small business set asides or changes to the definition of small business by government agencies;\n· increased use of lowest-priced, technically acceptable contract award criteria by government agencies;\n· increased aggressiveness by the government in seeking rights in technical data, computer software, and computer software documentation that we\ndeliver under a contract, which may result in “leveling the playing field” for competitors on follow-on procurements;\n· delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices; and\n· national or international health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 public health pandemic.\nWhile we expect that developing relationships with non-governmental customers will mitigate or eliminate this dependence on, and risk from, serving\ngovernmental entities, we can offer no assurances that we will be able to sufficiently diversify our customer portfolio in a time and manner to adequately\nmitigate this risk.\n7\nA decline in federal, state, or local government spending would likely negatively affect our product revenues and earnings.\nThe success of the cybersecurity solutions we sell depends substantially on the amount of funds budgeted by federal, state, and local government\nagencies that make up our current and potential customers. Global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme disruptions in the recent past,\nincluding severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates\nand uncertainty about economic stability. There can be no assurance that similar disruptions will not occur in the future. Deterioration in general economic\nconditions may result in lower tax revenues that could lead to reductions in government spending. Poor economic conditions could in turn lead to substantial\ndecreases in our net sales or have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position, and cash flows.\nWe are highly dependent on sales of our current solutions through indirect channels, the loss of which would materially adversely affect our operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, we derived 2.6% and 31.5% of our revenues from sales through indirect sales channels, such as\ndistributors, value-added resellers, system integrators, original equipment manufacturers and managed service providers. We must expand sales of our current\nsolutions as well as any new solutions through these indirect channels in order to increase our revenues. We cannot assure you that our current solutions or\nfuture solutions will gain market acceptance in these indirect sales channels or that sales through these indirect sales channels will increase our revenues.\nFurther, many of our competitors are also trying to sell their products and solutions through these indirect sales channels, which could result in lower prices and\nreduced profit margins for the sales of our solutions.\nOur business depends on the continued service of our key management and technical personnel.\nOur success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management, sales, marketing, research and development and operational personnel,\nincluding Anthony Scott, our President, and Chief Executive Officer; T. Joe Head, our Chief Technology Officer; Kimberly Pinson, our Chief Financial Officer;\nand other key technical personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on our\noperating results. We also believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled management, technical,\nmarketing, research and development, and operational personnel with experience in managing large and rapidly changing companies, as well as training,\nmotivating and supervising employees. The market for hiring and retaining certain technical personnel, including software engineers, has become more\ncompetitive and intense in recent years. Failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel, including software engineers, or retain\nour key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe could experience damage to our reputation in the cybersecurity industry in the event that our INTRUSION Shield solution fails to meet our customers’\nneeds or to achieve market acceptance.\nOur reputation in the industry may be harmed if we experience delivery delays, or if our customers do not perceive the benefits of purchasing and\nusing INTRUSION Shield as part of their comprehensive cybersecurity solution, our position as a leader in this technology space may be damaged and could\naffect the willingness of our customers, as well as potential customers, to purchase our other solutions that function separately from INTRUSION Shield. Any\nreputational damage could result in a decrease in orders for all our solutions, the loss of current customers, and a decrease in our overall revenues which could\nin turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to respond to rapid technological changes in the network security industry, we may lose customers, or our solutions may become obsolete.\nThe network security industry is characterized by frequent product and service introductions, rapidly changing technology, and continued evolution of\nnew industry standards. We have and must continue to introduce upgrades to our current solutions rapidly in response to changing circumstances and customer\nneeds such as the creation and introduction of new computer viruses or other novel external attacks on computer networks. Further, our new INTRUSION\nShield solution represents our efforts to continue to provide state-of-the art first-in-time innovation for our customer’s cybersecurity solutions. As a result, our\nsuccess depends upon our ability to develop and introduce timely upgrades, enhancements, and new solutions to meet evolving customer requirements and\nindustry standards. The development of technologically advanced network security products and solutions is a complex and uncertain process requiring high\nlevels of innovation, rapid response, and accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify,\ndevelop, manufacture, market or support new or enhanced solutions successfully in a timely manner. Further, we or our competitors may introduce new\nsolutions or enhancements that shorten the life cycle of our existing solutions or cause our existing solutions to become obsolete.\n8\nWe must expend time and resources addressing potential cybersecurity risk, and any breach of our information security safeguards could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company.\nThe threat of cyber-attacks requires additional time and money to be expended in efforts to prevent any breaches of our information security protocols.\nHowever, we can provide no assurances that we can prevent all such attempts from being successful, which could result in expenses to address and remediate\nsuch breaches as well as potentially losing the confidence of our customers who depend upon our services to prevent and mitigate such attacks on their\nrespective business. Should a material breach of our information security systems occur, it would likely have a material adverse impact on our business\noperations, our customer relations, and our current and future sales prospects, resulting in a significant loss of revenue.\nA breach of network security could harm public perception of our cybersecurity solutions, which could cause us to lose revenues.\nIf an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in the network of a customer of our cybersecurity solutions, regardless of whether the\nbreach is attributable to our solutions, the market perception of the effectiveness of our solutions could be harmed. This could cause us to lose current and\npotential end customers or cause us to lose current and potential value-added resellers and distributors. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to\naccess or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these\ntechniques.\nIf our solutions do not interoperate with our customers’ networks, installations will be delayed or cancelled and could harm our business.\nOur solutions are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks, each of which has different specifications and utilize multiple protocol\nstandards and products or solutions from other vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over\ntime as these networks have grown and evolved. Our solutions will be required to interoperate with many products and solutions within these networks as well\nas future products or solutions to meet our customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’\nnetworks, we may have to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our solutions will interoperate and scale with the existing\nsoftware and hardware, which could be costly and negatively impact our operating results. In addition, if our solutions do not interoperate with those of our\ncustomers’ networks, demand for our solutions could be adversely affected, orders for our solutions could be cancelled, or our solutions could be returned. This\ncould hurt our operating results, damage our reputation, and seriously harm our business and prospects.\nWe face intense competition from both start-up and established companies that may have significant advantages over us and our solutions.\nThe market for our solutions is intensely competitive. There are numerous companies competing with us in various segments of the data security\nmarkets, and their products or solutions may have advantages over our solutions in areas such as conformity to existing and emerging industry standards,\ninteroperability with networking and other cybersecurity products, management and security capabilities, performance, price, ease of use, scalability, reliability,\nflexibility, features, and technical support.\nOur principal competitors in the data mining and advanced persistent threat market include Darktrace, Trellix, and Recorded Futures. Our current and\npotential competitors may have one or more of the following significant advantages over us:\n· greater financial, technical, and marketing resources;\n· better name recognition;\n· more comprehensive security solutions;\n· better or more extensive cooperative relationships; and\n· larger customer base.\n9\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors. Some of our competitors may have, in relation\nto us, one or more of the following:\n· longer operating histories;\n· longer-standing relationships with OEM and end-user customers; and\n· greater customer service, public relations, and other resources.\nAs a result, these competitors may be able to more quickly develop or adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements,\nor devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or solutions. Additionally, it is likely that new competitors or alliances\namong existing competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy\nand completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may decline.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal\ncontrol. Further, we are required to report any changes in internal controls on a quarterly basis. In addition, we are required to furnish a report by management\non the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct”).\nIf we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in\na timely manner, or if we assert that our internal control over financial reporting is ineffective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness\nof our financial reports and the market price of the common stock could be negatively affected. We also could become subject to investigations by the stock\nexchange on which our securities are listed, the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”), or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional\nfinancial and management resources, and could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nScarcity of products and materials in the supply chain could hinder or prevent the deployment of our INTRUSION Shield for our customers who elect to\nuse the wired version of our solution.\nShould any of the component parts required for the hardware interface our customers use to access and to utilize the INTRUSION Shield product\nbecome scarce, we may have to delay or cancel our fulfillment of orders that could defer potential revenues or even result in customer cancellations, which\nwould have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe incur significantly increased costs because of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance\nmatters and initiatives.\nAs a public company with an obligation to file reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other\nexpenses that we would not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes various requirements on public companies, including\nrequiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of\ntime to these compliance initiatives. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we will incur to meet our additional disclosure obligations\nunder the Exchange Act or the timing of such costs.\n10\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and\nprocedures. We report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, in\nthe first Annual Report on Form 10-K following the date on which we no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company, we will be required to have our\nindependent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our compliance with Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act could require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts including the potential of hiring\nadditional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. If we are not able to comply with\nthe requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control\nover financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or\ninvestigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nInvestment Risks\nWe experience volatility in the market for our common stock, particularly with respect to swings in the market price as well as volatility in the trading of\nour common stock.\nWe experience significant shifts in the market value of our common stock as it trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq\") as well as volatility in\nthe trading volume of our shares on that market. For example, the market price of our common stock fluctuated between $78.00 and $4.40 during the year\nended December 31, 2023. These fluctuations may result in a hesitancy for investors to purchase and hold shares of our common stock, continued depression of\nthe market value of our stock, and ultimately negatively affect our ability to raise capital through the issuance and sale of our common stock, particularly\nthrough our At the Market (“ATM”) program or otherwise.\nNasdaq may delist our common stock from trading on its exchange, which could limit stockholders’ ability to trade our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, which requires us to meet certain financial, public float, bid price and liquidity\nstandards on an ongoing basis to continue the listing of our common stock. If we fail to meet these continued listing requirements, our common stock may be\nsubject to delisting.\nOn September 26, 2023, the Company received the Notification Letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that the closing bid price of the\nCompany’s common stock over the thirty consecutive trading days from August 14, 2023, through September 25, 2023, had fallen below $1.00 per share and\ntherefore, was not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement.\nOn October 26, 2023, we received a letter from Nasdaq’s Listing Qualifications Staff (the “Staff Determination”) notifying us that, based on the\nCompany's non-compliance with the $35 million minimum value listing standard for continued listing on the Nasdaq, as set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule\n5550(b)(2), the Company’s securities are subject to delisting from Nasdaq.\nThe Company requested a hearing before the Hearings Panel. This hearing was held on February 1, 2024, at which time the Company presented a plan\nto regain and sustain compliance with all the applicable requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Hearings Panel granted the\nCompany an extension until April 23, 2024, in which to regain compliance and cure the deficiencies for continued listing.\nThe Company is executing a plan to gain compliance with an alternative Nasdaq listing criteria, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the equity standard)\nwhich requires a minimum of $2.5 million in net equity. Pursuant to this multi-step plan, the Company: 1) is continuing to utilize its ATM program, 2) closed\non a private offering in November 2023 and is anticipating closing on an additional private offering of common stock in the near term, 3) sent warrant\ninducement letters to warrant holders from the Company’s 2022 registered direct offering and the November 2023 private offering temporarily reducing the\nexercise price of the outstanding warrants and 4) through a series of three transactions in the fourth quarter 2023 and two transactions in March 2024\nexchanged $10.0 million in senior debt for $750 thousand in common stock and $9.3 million new preferred Series A stock.\n11\nIn order to increase the share price of our common stock above the $1.00 Minimum Bid Requirement, we completed a reverse stock split of one share\nfor twenty which was effective on March 22, 2024.\nAll of these steps combined provide a path for regaining compliance, however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain or\nmaintain compliance with either Nasdaq listing criteria.\nIf our common stock is delisted and we are not able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities would\nbe quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including limited\navailability of market quotations for our common stock and reduced liquidity for the trading of our securities. In addition, we could experience a decreased\nability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nOur equity incentive plans allow us to issue stock options and award shares of our common stock. We may in the future create additional equity\nincentive plans, which may at that time require us to file a registration statement under the Securities Act to cover the issuance of shares upon the exercise or\nvesting of awards granted or otherwise purchased under those plans. As a result, any shares issued or granted under the plans may be freely tradable in the\npublic market. If equity securities are issued under the plans, if implemented, and it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, then the price of our\ncommon stock could decline substantially.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to do so in the future.\nHolders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by our Board. To date, we have paid no cash\ndividends on our shares of common stock, and we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain\nfuture earnings, if any, to provide funds for the operations of our business. Therefore, any return investors in our common stock may have will be in the form of\nappreciation, if any, in the market value of their shares of common stock.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nWe must adequately protect our intellectual property to prevent loss of valuable proprietary information.\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and non-disclosure agreements\nto protect our proprietary technology. However, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our solutions or to obtain and use\ninformation that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will\nprevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. This is particularly true in foreign countries whose laws may not protect proprietary rights to the same\nextent as the laws of the U.S. and may not provide us with an effective remedy against unauthorized use. If protection of our intellectual property proves to be\ninadequate or unenforceable, others may be able to use our proprietary developments without compensation to us, resulting in potential cost advantages to our\ncompetitors.\nWe may incur substantial expenses defending ourselves against claims of infringement.\nThere are numerous patents held by many companies relating to the design and manufacture of network security systems. Third parties may claim that\nour solutions infringe on their intellectual property rights. Any claim, with or without merit, could consume our management’s time, result in costly litigation,\ncause delays in sales or implementations of our solutions or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Royalty and licensing agreements, if\nrequired and available, may be on terms unacceptable to us or detrimental to our business. Moreover, a successful claim of product infringement against us or\nour failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology on commercially reasonable terms could seriously harm our business.\n12\nOur solutions are highly technical and if they contain undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected, and we might have to defend lawsuits or\npay damages in connection with any alleged or actual failure of our solutions and services.\nOur solutions are highly technical and complex, are critical to the operation of many networks and, in the case of ours, provide and monitor network\nsecurity and may protect valuable information. Our solutions have contained and may contain one or more undetected errors, defects, or security\nvulnerabilities. Some errors in our solutions may only be discovered after a solution has been installed and used by end customers. Any errors or security\nvulnerabilities discovered in our solutions after commercial release could result in loss of revenues or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers and\nincreased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we could face claims for product\nliability, tort, or breach of warranty. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert management’s attention. In addition, if our business\nliability insurance coverage is inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our financial condition could be harmed.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\nWe recognize the importance of securing our data and information systems and have a process for assessing, mitigating and managing cybersecurity\nand related risks.\nOur VP of Engineering, who reports to the CEO, leads our cybersecurity function and is responsible for managing our cybersecurity risk and the\nprotection of our networks, systems, and data. The VP of Engineering uses both internal and external resources to execute this process including our own\nINTRUSION Shield technology, to help prevent, identify, escalate, investigate, and resolve security incidents in a timely manner. The Company, with the\noversight of the CTO, also requires all employees to complete an annual cybersecurity training course.\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our enterprise risk management activities. The Board of Directors receives an update on the\nCompany’s risk management process and the risk trends related to cybersecurity at least annually.\nItem 2. Properties.\nOur corporate headquarters are currently located in 10,705 square feet of space at 101 East Park Blvd, Suite 1200, Plano Texas. This facility houses\nour corporate administration, engineering, sales, and marketing operations. The lease for this facility extends until March 2035. We also have engineers and\nother employees working remotely in Texas as well as several other states.\nWe believe that the existing facility will be adequate to meet our operational requirements through the expiration of the lease. We believe that our\nproperty insurance provides adequate coverage for our leased facilities. See Note 5 – Right-of-use Asset and Leasing Liabilities to our Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional information regarding our obligations under leases.\n13\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\nClass Action Litigation\nOn April 16, 2021, a class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas, Sherman Division, captioned Celeste\nv. Intrusion Inc. et al., Case No. 4:21-cv-00307 (E.D. Tex.) against us, our now-former chief financial officer, and now-former chief executive officer alleging,\namong other things, that the defendants made false and/or misleading statements or omissions about our business, operations, and prospects in violation of\nSection 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, as well as Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The Celeste lawsuit claimed\ncompensatory damages and legal fees.\nOn May 14, 2021, a related class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas, Sherman Division, captioned\nNeely v. Intrusion Inc., et al., Case No. 4:12-cv-00374 (E.D. Tex.) against us, our now-former chief financial officer, and now-former chief executive officer.\nThe Neely lawsuit alleged the same violations under the federal securities laws as those alleged in the Celeste lawsuit. The Neely lawsuit also sought\ncompensatory damages and legal fees.\nOn November 23, 2021, the Court consolidated the Celeste and Neely actions, and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead plaintiff’s counsel. The lead\nplaintiff filed his amended complaint on February 7, 2022.\nThe parties to the consolidated class action held a mediation on April 5, 2022, at the conclusion of which the parties executed a settlement term sheet\nsetting forth the material terms associated with the resolution of the action, subject to the preparation of formal documents and a plan of distribution approved\nby the Court. The settlement agreement was subject to certain terms and conditions and received final approval by the Court on December 16, 2022. At that\ntime, a final judgement was entered dismissing the case, with the Court retaining jurisdiction over the action for purposes of enforcing the terms of the class\nsettlement agreement. The $3.3 million settlement was paid by our insurance provider under our insurance policy as our retention had previously been\nexhausted.\nThe lead plaintiff in the class action filed a motion for distribution of settlement funds on February 21, 2023. The court approved the parties’ class\naction settlement and plan of allocation on March 22, 2023, and cancelled the previously-rescheduled March 31, 2023, hearing on the motion for distribution,\nall remaining matters in the class action then-pending have been fully and finally adjudicated.\nSecurities Investigation\nOn August 8, 2021, we received a notification from the SEC, Division of Enforcement, that it was conducting an investigation captioned In the Matter\nof Intrusion Inc. and requesting we produce certain documents and information. On November 9, 2021, the SEC served a subpoena to us in connection with\nthis investigation which formally requested substantially similar information as in the prior request. On September 26, 2023, we consented to the entry of final\njudgment, in the act styled Securities and Exchange Commission v Intrusion Inc, No. 4:23-CV-00859 (E.D. Tex. Filed September 26, 2023). On October 5,\n2023, the court approved the final judgment with no penalties assessed against the Company.\nStockholder Derivative Claim\nOn June 3, 2022, a stockholder derivative complaint was filed in U.S. District Court, District of Delaware by plaintiff Nathan Prawitt (the “Plaintiff\nStockholder”) on behalf of Intrusion against certain of our current and former officers and directors (collectively the “Defendants”). Plaintiff alleges that\nDefendants through various actions breached their fiduciary duties, wasted corporate assets, and unjustly enriched Defendants by (a) incurring costs and\nexpenses in connection with the ongoing SEC investigation, (b) incurring costs and expenses to defend us with respect to the consolidated class action, (c)\nsettling class-wide liability with respect to the consolidated class action, as well as ancillary claims regarding sales of our common stock by certain of the\nDefendants. On September 28, 2023, we agreed to settle the claim. On October 2, 2023, public notice of the settlement agreement was given. The settlement\nagreement provides in part for (i) an amendment to our Bylaws, committee Charters, and other applicable corporate policies to implement certain measures set\nforth more fully therein, to remain in effect for no less than three years; (ii) attorneys’ fees and expenses to plaintiff’s counsel of $0.3 million; and (iii) the\ndismissal of all claims against the Defendants, including the Company, in connection with the action. The $0.3 million settlement payment was paid by our\ninsurance provider under our insurance policy since our $0.5 million retention was previously exhausted. A hearing is scheduled for April 3, 2024, to obtain\ncourt approval of the settlement, agreement for the court to rule upon any objections to the proposed settlement, and for entry of final judgment in the matter.\nIn addition to these legal proceedings, we are subject to various other claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that\nany claims exist where the outcome of such matters would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, operating results, or cash\nflows. However, there can be no assurance such legal proceedings will not have a material impact on our future results.\n14\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters and Business Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nOur common stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market, where it is currently listed under the symbol “INTZ.” As of March 25, 2024, there were\napproximately ninety-five registered holders of record of our common stock. The Company does not have a history of paying dividends on its common stock\nand has no present intention to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nAll equity compensation plans under which our common stock is reserved for issuance have previously been approved by our stockholders. The\nfollowing table provides summary information as of December 31, 2023, for all our equity compensation plans (in thousands, except per share data). See Note\n10 – Stock-Based Compensation to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nNo. of shares\nof\ncommon stock\nNumber of remaining\nshares of Weighted available\ncommon stock average Number of for future\nto be issued exercise price shares issuance\nupon exercise of unvested Weighted under equity\nof outstanding outstanding restricted average grant compensation\noptions(1) options stock date fair value plans\nEquity compensation plans approved by security holders 50 $ 62.40 11 $ 26.20 82\nEquity compensation plans not approved by security holders – – – – –\nTotal 50 $ 62.40 11 $ 26.20 82\n(1) Included in the outstanding options are 4 from the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, twenty from the 2015 Stock Option Plan and twenty-six from the 2021\nOmnibus Incentive Plan.\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nGeneral\nThe following discussion and analysis include information management believes is relevant to understand and assess our consolidated financial\ncondition and results of operations. This section should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, accompanying notes and the risk\nfactors contained in this report.\nOverview\nIntrusion Inc. offers businesses of all sizes and industries products and services that leverage the Company’s exclusive threat intelligence database of\nover 8.5 billion IP addresses and domain names. After many years of gathering intelligence and providing our INTRUSION TraceCop and Savant solutions\nexclusively to government entities, we released our first commercial product in 2021, the INTRUSION Shield. INTRUSION Shield was designed to allow\nbusinesses to incorporate a Zero Trust, reputation-based security solution into their existing infrastructure to observe traffic flow and instantly block known\nmalicious or unknown connections from both entering or exiting a network, making it an ideal solution for protecting from Zero-Day and ransomware attacks.\n15\nMuch of 2022 was spent improving the INTRUSION Shield On-Premise performance and developing the Shield Cloud and End-Point solutions, both\nof which were released in September 2022. During 2023, our primary focus has been building out our sales reseller and channel platform and working with\nthose partners to 1) increase our sales pipeline and 2) progress customer prospects, leads and opportunities through the sales lifecycle. Gaining traction with our\nShield solutions has taken longer than initially anticipated. We feel that the progress made with our reseller and channel community along with refining our\nproduct messaging will help to shorten the sales cycle and grow revenues in future periods.\nAs discussed in more detail below, on December 31, 2023, we had $0.1 million in cash. If we are not able to obtain additional debt or equity financing\non terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may be unable to implement our business plan, fund our liquidity needs or even continue our operations.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n(in thousands) 2023 2022 $ %\nRevenue $ 5,611 $ 7,529 (1,918) -25.5%\nCost of Revenue 1,257 3,354 (2,097) -62.5%\nGross Profit 4,354 4,175 179 4.3%\nOperating Expenses:\nSales and marketing 5,670 6,510 (840) -12.9%\nResearch and development 5,556 6,465 (909) -14.1%\nGeneral and administrative 5,174 7,483 (2,309) -30.9%\nOperating Loss (12,046) (16,283) 4,237 26.0%\nInterest and Other Income 43 2,028 (1,985) -97.9%\nInterest Expense (1,888) (2,359) 471 20.0%\nGain on Lease Termination – 385 (385) -100.0%\nLoss Before Income Taxes (13,891) (16,229) 2,338 14.4%\nIncome Tax – – – –\nNet Loss $ (13,891) $ (16,229) 2,338 14.4%\nRevenues\nTotal revenue decreased $1.9 million or 25.5% to $5.6 million in 2023 from $7.5 million in 2022. Consulting revenues decreased $2.3 million\nprimarily resulting from the loss of a contract in the fourth quarter 2022 in which Intrusion’s prime sponsor chose not to renew the final option year of a\ncontract that had been in place since 2018. This contract represented annual revenue totaling $2.6 million. While the loss of this contract significantly impacted\nIntrusion’s top-line revenue, the gross margin on this contract was 14% and, as a result, had a marginal impact on profitability. We are continuing to pursue new\nconsulting opportunities and expect to see an increase in consulting revenues in 2024. The decline in consulting revenues was partially offset by an increase of\n$0.4 million in Shield revenues as a result of the expanded use of Shield from existing customers and new customers signed in 2023.\n16\nWe announced a $5 million multi-year Shield award in October 2023. The rollout of the Shield services to this customer has been delayed due to\nfactors outside of our control, we expect this project to be back on track beginning in the second quarter 2024. Additionally, we were informed by our largest\nShield customer that they will not be renewing their contract. This customer was one of the original users of the product and had a non-standard custom\nimplementation of INTRUSION Shield that is no longer supported. This non-renewal will impact revenues beginning in the second quarter 2024. We are\nbeginning to see traction with our Shield products with multiple Shield sales that, essentially, are paid proof of values which have the potential for significant\nShield sales growth beyond the initial engagement. On December 31, 2023, our Shield opportunities comprised a large percentage of our sales pipeline.\nConcentration of Revenues.\nRevenues from sales to various U.S. government entities totaled $2.6 million, or 46.2% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared\nto $5.0 million, or 65.8% of revenues, for the same period in 2022. In 2023 we had two government entities that individually accounted for over 10% of our\nrevenues compared to three in 2022. Sales to commercial customers totaled $3.0 million or 53.8% of total revenue for year ended December 31, 2023,\ncompared to $2.6 million or 34.2% of total revenue for the same period in 2022. Two commercial customers individually accounted for over 10% of total\nrevenues in both 2023 and 2022. We have increased our Shield sales and marketing efforts by expanding our reseller channels. We anticipate our concentration\nof revenues will vary among customers in future periods depending upon the timing of certain sales, we anticipate that sales to government customers, while\ncomprising a significant portion of our revenues in future periods, will represent a lower percentage of our revenue base as we gain traction selling our Shield\nproducts into commercial markets.\nSales to the government present risks in addition to those involved in sales to commercial customers which could adversely affect our revenues,\nincluding, without limitation, potential disruption to appropriation and spending patterns and the government’s reservation of the right to cancel contracts and\npurchase orders for its convenience. Fourth quarter 2023 revenues declined 7% sequentially from third quarter 2023 primarily due to the continuing resolution\nand the absence of an approved federal budget, which has resulted in many new spending decisions from government customers being delayed. Specifically, a\nlong-standing Department of Defense contract has not been funded for the 2024 government fiscal year, this resulted in lower consulting revenues in the fourth\nquarter and has also impacted first quarter 2024 revenues. Currently, we are not aware of any additional proposed cancellation or renegotiation of any of our\nexisting arrangements with government entities and, historically, cancellations or renegotiated orders by government entities have not resulted in a material\nadverse effect on our business.\nThe Company’s similar product and service offerings are not viewed as individual segments, as its management analyzes the business as a whole and\nexpenses are not allocated to each product offering.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the 12-months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 totaled $4.4 million or 77.6% compared to $4.2 million or 55.5%. The\nsignificantly improved gross margin in 2023 is mostly due to the loss of the low margin contract discussed above and Shield revenues representing a larger\npercentage of revenues, 28.4% compared to 15.6% in 2022. To the extent Shield revenues become a larger percentage of revenues, we anticipate we will\ncontinue to see favorable growth in gross profit margins.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, totaled $16.4 million, a decrease of 19.8% when compared to $20.5 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022. The year over year change was most notably due to the reduced legal expense associated with the various litigation matters that\narose in 2021 that for the most part are fully settled, and reduced contractor labor and employee costs. Employee headcount on December 31, 2023, totaled\nforty-nine compared to sixty-seven on December 31, 2022.\n17\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses decreased to $5.7 million in 2023, compared to $6.5 million in 2022. Certain discretionary marketing spends inclusive\nof participation in trade shows, utilization of third-party contractors for content and product messaging and travel, are likely to vary over time based on savings\ninitiatives that may be necessary.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses decreased to $5.6 million in 2023 compared to $6.5 million in 2022. Many of the cost reduction measures taken\nin 2023 related to research and development costs. Research and development costs may vary over time as we determine the frequency of new releases,\nimproved functionality and enhancements needed to be competitive with our product offering.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $5.2 million in 2023 compared to $7.5 million in 2022. The decrease in general and administrative\nexpenses is primarily due to a reduction in legal costs of $1.4 million associated with various litigation matters that arose in 2021 and continued through 2023.\nThe majority of all matters have since settled as described in more detail in Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this report. In late 2022 we hired an in-house General\nCounsel which also contributed to the reduced outside legal costs in 2023. Other factors contributing to the decreased spend include (i) reduced use of\nconsultants and contractors in 2023, (ii) recruiting fees incurred in the 2022 period, and (iii) voluntary temporary reductions in director and officer\ncompensation. Insurance expense for our Directors’ and Officers’ insurance policy increased in 2023 when compared to 2022 as a result of the class action\nlawsuits and related claims activity and, increasing coverage limits for our new policy year.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense consists primarily of interest related to the Streeterville notes entered into in March and June of 2022 and related debt issuance\ncost amortization as well as interest expense from finance leases. Interest expense for 2023 totaled $1.9 million, a decrease of $0.5 million. The decrease\nprimarily relates to the reversal of interest recorded to accrete the value of the Streeterville notes to the stock-settled value for potential redemptions paid in\nstock as no redemption payments in cash or stock were made in 2023.\nInterest and Other Income\nInterest and other income were negligible in 2023. 2022 included $2.0 million related to the Cares Act Employee Retention Credit (“ERC”).\nGain on Lease Termination\nIn 2022 we recorded a gain of $0.4 million relating to the settlement of our lease abandonment lawsuit.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was 0% in 2023 and 2022 as valuation allowances have been recorded for the entire amount of the net deferred tax\nassets due to uncertainty of realization.\n18\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nOur cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 (in thousands) were:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (7,767) $ (13,190)\nNet cash used in investing activities (1,448) (1,479)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 6,339 13,584\nChange in cash and cash equivalents $ (2,876) $ (1,085)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, was ($7.8) million due to a net loss of ($13.9) million, offset by 1) adjustments for\nnon-cash items of $4.7 million which are mostly comprised of depreciation, stock-based compensation, and interest related to Streeterville notes and 2) $1.4\nmillion provided from working capital principally relating to the cash receipt of amounts due relating to ERC.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, was ($13.2) million due to a net loss of ($16.2) million offset by adjustments for\nnon-cash items of $5.0 million which are mostly comprised of depreciation, stock-based compensation and interest related to Streeterville notes, and changes in\nworking capital consisting primarily of a reduction in trade receivables of $0.5 million; an increase in other receivables relating principally to the remaining\nERC refund outstanding ($1.5) million; an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses $0.2 million; and a decrease in operating lease liabilities ($1.0)\nmillion.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was ($1.4) million, which was principally the capitalization of internally\ndeveloped software.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, totaled ($1.5) million and was primarily related to capitalized internal use\nsoftware of ($1.2) million for the new Shield Cloud and End Point solutions as well as enhancements to the Shield On-Premise solution and, the purchase of\nequipment for use with the Shield On-Premise solution, in the data center and by employees of ($0.3) million.\nFinancing Activities\nFor year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $6.3 million which consisted principally of proceeds from sales of\ncommon stock using our ATM program of $4.7 million and a private placement in November 2023 of $2.3 million offset partially by a $0.4 million paydown\non the Streeterville notes.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Primary sources of cash from financing activities\nincluded proceeds from the issuance of the two Streeterville notes payable, net of issuance costs, equal to $9.3 million (see Note 6 Notes Payable to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K), net proceeds received from our registered direct offering of $4.3 million, net proceeds\nfrom issuance of shares from our ATM program of $2.0 million, and proceeds received from a private placement sale of common stock equal to $0.1 million.\nFunds used in financing activities included ($1.5) million in principal repayments on the Streeterville notes payable and ($0.6) million payments on equipment\nfinancing leases.\n19\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $0.1 million and a working capital deficit of ($13.1) million. We need to raise\nadditional funds to continue operations and comply with our financial obligations.\nWe are executing a plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing standards as described more fully in Item 1A Risk Factors. This multi-step plan\nincludes: 1) continued utilization of our ATM program, 2) private offerings of common stock, 3) a warrant inducement offer for the sale of common stock at a\nreduced exercise price to warrant holders from the Company’s 2022 registered direct offering and November 2023 private offerings, and 4) a series of three\ntransactions in the fourth quarter 2023 and two transactions in March 2024 exchanging $10.0 million in senior debt for $750 thousand in common stock and\n$9.3 million new preferred Series A stock. While the debt for equity exchanges does not provide funding for operations, it substantially deleverages the\ncompany and reduces the working capital deficit. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to close on or obtain such financing on acceptable terms or\nat all and, in the case of equity or equity-linked financings, such financings will result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nOur principal sources of cash for funding operations in 2023 has been net proceeds received from sales of common stock using our ATM program of\n$4.7 million, a private placement offering completed in November 2023 of $2.3 million, and net funds through changes in working capital which includes\nreceipt of the remaining ERC refund in the March quarter of $1.4 million. Our principal source of cash for funding operations and growth in 2022 was issuance\nof the two Streeterville notes which contributed $9.3 million, net of issuance costs, and $6.4 million from the sale and issuance of common stock and warrants.\nATM Program\nB. Riley Securities, Inc. acts as sales agent under our ATM program, which allows us to potentially sell up to $50.0 million of our common stock using\nthe shelf-registration statement on Form S-3 filed on August 5, 2021. On April 11, 2023, as a result of limitations under General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3,\nand in agreement with the terms of the sales agreement, the Company revised the aggregate offering price of shares of common stock that we can sell pursuant\nto the ATM program to $15.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we received $4.7 million, net of fees for sales of common stock pursuant to the\nprogram.\nFor as long as our public float is less than $75 million, we will be subject to the limitations set forth in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, which\nlimit our ability to conduct primary offerings. Under such limitations, we may not sell, during any 12-month period, securities on Form S-3 having an\naggregate market value of more than one-third of our public float. As of March 25, 2024, our public float calculated in accordance with General Instruction\nI.B.6 of Form S-3 was $6.8 million.\nNotes Payable\nWe entered into a securities purchase agreement (“SPA”) with Streeterville on March 10, 2022, pursuant to which Streeterville purchased two\npromissory notes with substantively identical terms. Streeterville purchased the first note on March 10, 2022, and the second note on June 29, 2022, each note\nwith an aggregate principal amount of $5.4 million in exchange for $5.0 million less certain expenses. We received an aggregate of approximately $9.3 million,\nnet of transaction expenses, in connection with these issuances.\nIn 2023 and 2022 we made $0.4 million and $1.5 million in principal payments, respectively. In the fourth quarter 2023 through 3 separate\ntransactions, we exchanged $0.6 million in aggregate principal on the First Note for 93.6 thousand shares of our common stock. In March 2024, we exchanged\n$0.2 million in principal for 52.2 thousand shares of common stock. Also in March 2024, we exchanged $9.3 million in principle for 9,275 shares of our newly\ncreated Series A preferred stock. The issuance of both common and preferred shares was made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements\nafforded by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. The Series A preferred stock has a stated value of $1,100 per share and is subject to the preferences and\ndesignations as more fully described in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation filed on March 15, 2024. Following the exchanges noted herein,\nthe remaining balance on the First Note was $0.5 million. The maturity date for the First Note is September 2024.\n20\nThere can be no assurance that we will improve our liquidity position or our ability to make redemption or principal payments.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which\nhave been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nOn an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to credit losses, income taxes, warranty obligations, maintenance contracts and\ncontingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the\nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual\nresults may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nCapitalized Software Development\nWe capitalize internally developed software using the Agile software development methodology which allows us to accurately track, and record costs\nassociated with new software development and enhancements.\nPursuant to ASC Topic 250-40 Internal Use Software Accounting Capitalization, certain development costs related to our products during the\napplication development stage are capitalized as part of property and equipment. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as\nincurred. The preliminary stage includes such activities as conceptual formulation of alternatives, evaluation of alternatives, determination of existence of\nneeded technology, and the final selection of alternatives. Once the application development stage is reached, internal and external costs are capitalized until\nthe software is complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized internal use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life,\nwhich is generally three years.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize product revenue upon shipment or after meeting certain performance obligations. These products can include hardware, software\nsubscriptions and consulting services. Most of our sales are from consulting services. We also offer software on a subscription basis subject to SaaS. Warranty\ncosts have not been material.\nWe recognize sales of its consulting services in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards\nCodification (“ASC”) Topic 606 whereby revenue from contracts with customers are recognized once the criteria under the five steps below are met:\ni) identification of the contract with a customer;\nii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\niii) determination of the transaction price;\niv) allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance obligations; and\nv) recognition of revenue upon satisfaction of a performance obligation.\n21\nConsulting services including reporting are typically done monthly, and revenue is matched accordingly. Product sales may include maintenance and\ncustomer support allocated revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy\nusing the relative selling price method. All product offering and service offering market values are readily determined based on current and prior stand-alone\nsales. We defer and recognize maintenance, updates, and support revenue over the term of the contract period, which is generally one year.\nNormal payment terms offered to customers, distributors and resellers are net 30 days domestically. We do not offer payment terms that extend beyond\none year and rarely extend payment terms beyond our normal terms. If certain customers do not meet our credit standards, we require payment in advance to\nlimit our credit exposure.\nWith our newest product, INTRUSION Shield, we began offering software on a subscription basis. INTRUSION Shield is a hosted arrangement\nsubject to SaaS guidance under ASC Topic 606. SaaS arrangements are accounted for as subscription services not arrangements that transfer a license of\nintellectual property.\nWe utilize the five-step process, mentioned above, per ASC Topic 606 to recognize sales and will follow that directive, also, to define revenue items as\nindividual and distinct. INTRUSION Shield services provided to our customers for a fixed monthly subscription fee include:\n· access to Intrusion’s proprietary software and database to detect and prevent unauthorized access to our clients’ information networks;\n· use of all software, associated media, printed materials, data, files, online documentation, and any equipment that Intrusion provides for customers to\naccess the INTRUSION Shield; and\n· tech support, post contract customer support (“PCS”) including daily program releases or corrections provided by Intrusion without additional charge.\nOur contract provides for no other services, and our customers have no rebates or return rights, nor are any such rights anticipated to be offered as part\nof this service.\nWe satisfy our performance obligation when our INTRUSION Shield solution is available to detect and prevent unauthorized access to a client’s\ninformation networks. Revenue is recognized monthly over the term of the contract. The Company’s standard initial contract terms automatically renew unless\nnotice is given 30 days before renewal. Upfront payment of fees is deferred and amortized into income over the period covered by the contract.\nAllowances for Credit Losses\nWe maintain allowances for credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Our receivables\nare uncollateralized, and we expect to continue this policy in the future. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an\nimpairment of their ability to make payments, increased allowances may be required. Historically, our estimate for sales returns and credit losses have not\ndiffered materially from actual results.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe calculate the fair value of our assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments and include additional information in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of these financial instruments.

Financial Statements.\nThe information required by this Item 8 begins on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,\nconducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-\n15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of\nthe period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to\nbe disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the\nCompany’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules\n13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the\npreparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Company’s management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer,\nconducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control—\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s evaluation included an assessment\nof elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and the Company’s\noverall control environment. Based on its evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of\nConsolidated Financial Statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company reviewed\nthe results of management’s assessment with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial\nreporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and\nExchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report. This report shall not be deemed to be filed for\npurposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the\nCompany, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.\n23\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nThe Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s disclosure\ncontrols or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated,\ncan provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that\nthere are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control\nsystems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances\nof fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there\ncan be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the\neffectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in\nthe degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and\n15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B. Other Information.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, no director or officer adopted or terminated any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1\ntrading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\n24\nPART III\nCertain information required by Part III is omitted from this Form 10-K because we will file a definitive Proxy Statement for our 2024 annual meeting\nof stockholders pursuant to Regulation 14A (the “Proxy Statement”) no later than 120 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, and certain information to be included therein is incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 10.

Wilson\n29\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nIntrusion Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intrusion Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the\nrelated consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company\nas of December 31, 2023, and 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the entity will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial\nstatements, the entity has suffered recurring losses from operations, negative cash flows from operations, and has a net working capital deficiency that raise\nsubstantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial\nstatements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based\non our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required\nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor\nwere we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control over financial reporting.\nAccordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to\nthe audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Whitley Penn LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009.\nDallas, Texas\nApril 1, 2024\nF-1\nINTRUSION INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Description of Business\nIntrusion, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” Intrusion,” “Intrusion Inc.”, “we”, “us”, “our”, or similar terms) was organized in\nTexas in September 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in October 1995. Our principal executive offices are located at 101 East Park Boulevard, Suite 1200,\nPlano, Texas 75074, and our telephone number is (972) 234-6400. Our website URL is www.intrusion.com.\nThe Company develops, sells, and supports products that protect any-sized company or government organization by fusing advanced threat intelligence with\nreal-time mitigation to kill cyberattacks as they occur – including Zero-Days. The Company markets and distributes the Company’s solutions through value-\nadded resellers, managed service providers and a direct sales force. The Company’s end-user customers include U.S. federal government entities, state and\nlocal government entities, and companies ranging in size from mid-market to large enterprises.\nTraceCop (“TraceCop™”) and Savant (“Savant™”) are registered trademarks of Intrusion Inc. The Company has applied for trademark protection for the\nCompany’s new INTRUSION Shield cybersecurity solution.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include its accounts and those of its wholly owned subsidiary and are prepared in accordance with\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany had cash and cash equivalents of $0.1 million and a working capital deficit of $13.1 million. In addition, the Company has incurred net operating\nlosses during the last four years. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the\ndate of these financial statements. The Company’s principal source of cash for funding operations in 2023 has been net proceeds received through the issuance\nof common stock using the Company’s ATM program which provided $4.7 million, a private placement offering completed in November 2023 of $2.3 million,\nand net funds through changes in working capital which includes receipt of the remaining ERC refund in the March quarter of $1.4 million. Subsequent to\nDecember 31, 2023, through the date of these financial statements, the Company has received $0.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of the ATM.\nManagement plans to fund the operations of the Company through additional debt or equity financing and the issuance of common stock. If the Company is not\nable to obtain additional debt or equity financing or raise adequate funds under the Company’s ATM program, the Company may be unable to implement the\nCompany’s business plan, fund its liquidity needs or even continue its operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the\nrecoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nReverse Stock Split\nThe Company effected a reverse stock split of 1-for-20 on March 22, 2024. Unless otherwise stated, all share and per share amounts for all periods presented\nhave been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.\nF-6\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used\nfor, but not limited to, the accounting for credit losses, revenue recognition, warranty costs, depreciation, and stock-based compensation and income taxes.\nActual results could differ from these estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash\nbalances that may at times exceed federally insured limits. The Company’s cash balances are maintained at a high-quality financial institution, and the\nCompany believes the credit risk related to these cash balances is minimal. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company had approximately $0.1 million\nand $3.0 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nTrade accounts receivable is stated at the amount the Company expects to collect. The Company maintains allowances for credit losses for estimated losses\nresulting from the inability of its customers to make the required payments. Management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of\nspecific customer accounts: customer creditworthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer\npayment trends. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional\nallowances would be required. Based on management’s assessment, the Company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings\nand an increase to allowance for credit losses. Balances that remain outstanding after the Company has made reasonable collection efforts are written off\nthrough a charge to the allowance credit losses.\nThe Company’s accounts receivable represents unconditional contract billings for sales per contracts with customers and are classified as current. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and January 1, 2022, the Company had accounts receivable balances of $0.4 million, $0.5 million, and $1.0 million, respectively. As\nof December 31, 2023, the Company had an allowance for credit losses of $0.1 million. The Company did not recognize an allowance for credit losses as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nRisk Concentration\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, and\naccounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalent deposits are at risk to the extent that they exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured amounts. To\nminimize risk, the Company places its investments in U.S. government obligations, corporate securities, and money market funds. Substantially all the\nCompany’s cash, cash equivalents and investments are maintained with one major U.S. financial institution. The Company does not believe that it is subject to\nany unusual financial risk with the Company’s banking arrangements. The Company has not experienced any significant losses on its cash and cash\nequivalents.\nThe Company sells its products to customers primarily in the U.S. The Company has begun to sell the Company’s products internationally. Fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates and adverse economic developments in foreign countries could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. The Company\nperforms ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally requires no collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential\ncredit losses, and such losses, in aggregate, have historically been minimal.\nF-7\nThe Company’s operations are concentrated in one area - security software/entity identification. Sales to the U.S. Government through direct and indirect\nchannels totaled 46.2% of total revenues attributable to six government customers and 65.8% of total revenues attributable to seven government customers for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Two individual government customers and two individual commercial customers during the year\nended December 31, 2023, individually accounted for over 10% of total revenues and during the year ended December 31, 2022, three government customers\nand two commercial customers, individually accounted for over 10% of total revenues. For 2023, four customers represent 86% of total revenue. For 2022, five\ncustomers represent 90% of total revenue. For Shield, one customer accounts for 79% and 68% of Shield revenue for 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\nCompany’s similar product and service offerings are not viewed as individual segments, as the Company’s management analyzes the business as a whole and\nexpenses are not allocated to each product offering.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Assets\nThe Company’s prepaid expenses and other assets balance is primarily related to prepaid insurance, prepaid software, and other services, which represents the\nunamortized balance of insurance premiums, or other prepaid services and products. These payments are amortized on a straight-line basis over the policy or\nservice term.\nProperty and Equipment\nEquipment, furniture, and fixtures are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the\nassets. Such lives vary from one to five years. Capitalized software development is stated at cost less accumulated amortization on a straight line basis over its\nestimated useful life, which is generally three years. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized on a straight-\nline basis over the shorter of estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining terms of the leases. Such lives vary from two to five years. Expenditures for\nmajor renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company capitalizes internally developed software using the Agile software development methodology which allows the Company to accurately track, and\nrecord costs associated with new software development and enhancements. Pursuant to ASC Topic 350-40 Internal Use Software Accounting Capitalization,\ncertain development costs related to the Company’s products during the application development stage are capitalized as part of property and equipment. Costs\nincurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. The preliminary stage includes such activities as conceptual formulation of\nalternatives, evaluation of alternatives, determination of existence of needed technology, and the final selection of alternatives. Once the application\ndevelopment stage is reached, internal and external costs are capitalized until the software is complete and ready for its intended use.\nDepreciation and amortization are recorded as operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Depreciation and amortization related to the\nCompany’s property and equipment balances totaled approximately $1.0 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022,\nrespectively.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an\nasset to future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows, the assets are written\ndown to fair value. During the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, there was no impairment of long-lived assets.\nF-8\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for leases using the guidance in ASC Topic 842. The Company evaluates new contracts at inception to determine if the contract\nconveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period in exchange for periodic payments. A lease exists if the Company obtains substantially all\nthe economic benefits of an asset, and the Company has the right to direct the use of that asset. When a lease exists, the Company records a right-of-use asset\nthat represents its right to use the asset over the lease term and a lease liability that represents its obligation to make payments over the lease term. Lease\nliabilities are recorded at the sum of future lease payments discounted by the collateralized rate the Company could obtain to lease a similar asset over a similar\nperiod, and right-of-use assets are recorded equal to the corresponding lease liability, plus any prepaid or direct costs. The Company does not record a right-of-\nuse asset for leases with initial terms of twelve months or less.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nLiabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties, or other sources and are recorded when it is probable that a\nliability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. The Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims and\nadministrative proceedings arising in the normal course of business. For additional information, see Note 7 – Commitments and Contingencies.\nForeign Currency\nAll assets and liabilities in the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar is translated at year-end exchange\nrates. All revenues and expenses in the statement of operations of these foreign subsidiaries are translated at average exchange rates for the year. Translation\ngains and losses are not included in determining net income but are shown in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders’ deficit section of the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in determining net loss and were not significant.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company calculates the fair value of the assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments and include additional information in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of these financial instruments. The estimated fair value of accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. Notes payable\nand financing and operating leases approximate fair value as they bear market rates of interest. None of these instruments are held for trading purposes.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes product revenue upon shipment or after meeting certain performance obligations. These products can include hardware, software\nsubscriptions and consulting services. The Company also offers software on a subscription basis subject to SaaS. Warranty costs have not been material.\nThe Company recognize sales of the Company’s data sets in accordance with ASC Topic 606 whereby revenue from contracts with customers are recognized\nonce the criteria under the five steps below are met:\ni) identification of the contract with a customer;\nii) identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\niii) determination of the transaction price;\niv) allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance obligations; and\nv) recognition of revenue upon satisfaction of a performance obligation.\nF-9\nConsulting services include reporting and are typically done monthly, and revenue is matched accordingly. Product sales may include maintenance and\ncustomer support allocated revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy\nusing the relative selling price method. All product offering and service offering market values are readily determined based on current and prior stand-alone\nsales. The Company defers and recognizes maintenance, updates, and support revenue over the term of the contract period, which is generally one year.\nNormal payment terms offered to customers, distributors and resellers are net 30 days domestically. The Company does not offer payment terms that extend\nbeyond one year and rarely does it extend payment terms beyond normal terms. If certain customers do not meet credit standards, the Company requires\npayments in advance to limit credit exposure.\nWith the Company’s newest product, INTRUSION Shield, the Company began offering software on a subscription basis. INTRUSION Shield is a hosted\narrangement subject to SaaS guidance under ASC Topic 606. SaaS arrangements are accounted for as subscription services, not arrangements that transfer a\nlicense of intellectual property.\nThe Company utilizes the five-step process, mentioned above, per ASC Topic 606 to recognize sales and will follow that directive, also, to define revenue\nitems as individual and distinct. INTRUSION Shield services are provided to customers for a fixed monthly subscription fee include:\n· access to Intrusion’s proprietary software and database to detect and prevent unauthorized access to clients’ information networks;\n· use of all software, associated media, printed materials, data, files, online documentation, and any equipment that Intrusion provides for customers to\naccess the INTRUSION Shield; and\n· tech support, PCS includes daily program releases or corrections provided by Intrusion without additional charge.\nINTRUSION Shield contracts provide for no other services, and the Company’s customers have no rebates or return rights, nor are any such rights anticipated\nto be offered as part of this service.\nThe Company satisfies performance obligations when the INTRUSION Shield solution is available to detect and prevent unauthorized access to a client’s\ninformation networks. Revenue is recognized monthly over the term of the contract. The Company’s standard initial contract terms automatically renew unless\nnotice is given 30 days before renewal. Upfront payment of fees is deferred and amortized into income over the period covered by the contract.\nThe Company’s accounts receivable represents unconditional contract billings for sales per contracts with customers and are classified as current assets. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company had accounts receivable balance of $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany had an allowance for credit losses of $0.1 million. The Company did not recognize an allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022.\nContract liabilities consist of cash payments in advance of the Company satisfying performance obligations and recognizing revenue. The Company classifies\ncontract liabilities as deferred revenue.\nThe following table presents changes in the Company’s contract liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nBalance at beginning of year $ 455 $ 560\nAdditions 4,727 1,877\nRevenue recognized (4,743) (1,982)\nBalance at end of year $ 439 $ 455\nF-10\nAccounting for Stock-based Compensation Awards\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards using the guidance in ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). The\nCompany’s stock-based compensation awards are granted to directors, officers, and employees. ASC 718 requires all such stock-based compensation, including\ngrants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the\nstatements of operations for the years ended 2023 and 2022 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest.\nResearch and Development Costs\nThe Company’s research and development of new software products are expensed until the application development stage is obtained. Once the application\ndevelopment stage is reached, internal and external costs are capitalized until the software is complete and ready for the intended use. The company incurs\nresearch and development costs that relate primarily to the development of new security software, appliances and integrated solutions, and major enhancements\nto existing services and products. Research and development costs are comprised primarily of sales and related benefit expenses, contract labor and prototype\nand other expenses incurred during research and development efforts.\nPursuant to ASC Topic 350-40, Internal Use Software Accounting-Capitalization, software development costs related to the Company’s products during the\napplication development stage are capitalized.\nAdvertising Expenses\nThe cost of advertising is expensed as incurred or deferred until first use of advertising and expensed ratably over the applicable periods. Advertising expenses\nwere $0.1 million and $0.5 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are determined using the liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and\nliabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years\nin which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is\nrecognized in income in the period enacted. In addition, a valuation allowance is established to reduce any deferred tax asset for which it is determined that it is\nmore likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nASC Topic 740 creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position\nis required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification,\ninterest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. There are no unrecognized tax benefits to disclose in the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction. On December 31, 2023, tax returns related to fiscal years ended December 31, 2020,\nthrough December 31, 2022, remain open to possible examination by most tax authorities while tax returns in a few states remain open related to fiscal years\nended December 31, 2019, through December 31, 2022. No tax returns are currently under examination by any tax authorities.\nF-11\nNet Loss Per Share\nThe Company reports two separate net loss per shares numbers, basic and diluted. Basic net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by\ndividing net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted net loss\nattributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year by the weighted average\nnumber of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the year. The common stock equivalents include all common stock issuable\nupon the exercise of outstanding warrants, options and vesting of restricted stock awards. The aggregate number of common stock equivalents excluded from\nthe diluted loss per share calculated for the year ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 totaled 182 thousand and sixty-six thousand, respectively. Since the\nCompany is in a net loss position for the year ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, basic and dilutive net loss per share is the same.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The new standard requires annual disclosure of the\nspecific categories in the rate reconciliation, and additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. Additional information may be\nrequired on reconciling items. The new guidance is effective after December 15, 2024, early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of\nthe new guidance on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.\n3.

Notes Payable\nOn March 10, 2022, Intrusion Inc. entered into a SPA with Streeterville whereby the Company issued two separate promissory notes of $5.4 million each, with\nan initial interest rate of 7%, subject to some increases in the case of among other things, an event of default. On March 10, 2022, the Company received $4.6\nmillion in net funds from the first tranche (First Note) pursuant to a promissory note executed contemporaneously with the execution of the loan agreement. On\nJune 29, 2022, the Company received an additional $4.7 million in net funds from the second tranche (Second Note) pursuant to a promissory note. Each note\nhad an 18-month maturity, may be prepaid subject to varying prepayment premiums, and may be redeemed at any time after six months into the term of such\nnote in amounts up to $0.5 million per calendar month upon the noteholder’s election. On January 11, 2023, the Company amended the promissory notes issued\npursuant to the unsecured loan agreement with Streeterville whereby the noteholder agreed to waive their redemption rights through March 31, 2023, in\nexchange for a fee equal to 3.75% of the outstanding principal balance which increased the outstanding indebtedness due at maturity with Streeterville and\nincreased the associated debt issuance costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets by $0.4 million. On August 2, 2023, the Company entered into a\nForbearance Agreement with Streeterville which was subsequently amended on August 7, 2023. The Forbearance Agreement and amendment extend the\nmaturity dates for each Note by twelve months to September 2024 and December 2024. In consideration of the extension of the maturity dates, the Company\nentered into a Security Agreement with Streeterville, dated August 2, 2023 (the “Security Agreement”), under which Streeterville was granted a first-position\nsecurity interest in all assets of the Company.\nThe Company has the option, in its sole discretion, to satisfy any redemption demands in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock that will be issued in\nan amount equal to the dollar amount of the redemption demand divided by the number that represents 85% of the average of the two lowest daily volume\nweighted average prices of common stock over a fifteen-day trailing period. This option to settle in shares at a 15% discount is deemed a beneficial conversion\nfeature (“BCF”). Any remaining indebtedness at maturity is payable in cash.\nThe Company evaluated both the First and Second Note in accordance with ASC Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” because the promissory\nnote (1) embodies an unconditional obligation, (2) may require the Company to settle the optional redemption obligation by issuing a variable number of\ncommon shares, and (3) is based solely on a fixed monetary amount known at inception.\nThe lender does not benefit if the fair value of the Company’s common stock increases and does not bear the risk that the fair value of the Company’s common\nstock might decrease. In accordance with ASC Topic 480, the promissory notes have been recorded as a liability and the company is recording interest expense\nover the term of the promissory note, using the interest method from ASC Topic 835-30, to accrete the carrying amount of the promissory note up to the\nredemption common stock settlement amount.\nIn 2023 and 2022, the Company paid $0.4 million and $1.5 million in cash principal payments on the notes, respectively. The Company has recorded debt issue\ncosts totaling $1.8 million associated with the issuance and amendment of the notes which are being amortized over their respective terms. As of December 31,\n2023, the balance of unamortized debt issuance costs for both notes were $0.4 million.\nOn October 11, 2023, and October 17, 2023, the Company agreed to exchange $0.4 million in aggregate principal on the Streeterville First Note for 50.1\nthousand shares of the Company’s common stock. On December 19, 2023, the Company exchanged an additional $0.2 million in principal for 43.5 thousand\nshares of common stock. The issuance of the shares was made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements afforded by the Securities Act.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded $1.7 million and $2.3 million of interest expense, respectively, in the accompanying\nConsolidated Statement of Operations. The interest recorded associated with the promissory notes increases the associated notes payable on the accompanying\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As a result of the Forbearance Agreement and subsequent amendment discussed above, the balance of the notes payable matures\nin September 2024 and December 2024. The effective interest rate of the notes payable including amortization of the debt issuance costs and accretion of BCF\nis 20.3% and 18.1% for the First and Second Note , respectively.\nF-15\nOn March 7, 2024, the Company exchanged an additional $0.2 million in principal on the Streeterville First Note for 52.2 thousand shares of common stock.\nAdditionally, on March 15, 2024, the Company exchanged $9.3 million in aggregate principal for 9,275 shares of newly designated Series A preferred stock.\nThe issuance of both the common and preferred shares was made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements afforded by the Securities Act.\nThis most recent exchange resulted in the Streeterville Second Note being paid in full and $0.5 million remaining outstanding on the Streeterville First Note.\n7. Commitments and Contingencies\nChange of Control and Severance Agreements\nCertain members of the Company’s management are parties to severance and change of control agreements with the Company. The severance and change in\ncontrol agreements provide those individuals with severance payments in certain circumstances and prohibit such individuals from, among other things,\ncompeting with the Company during his or her employment. In addition, the severance and change of control agreements prohibit subject individuals from,\namong other things, disclosing confidential information about the Company and its products or interfering with a client or customer of the Company, in each\ncase during his or her employment and for certain periods (including indefinite periods) following the termination of such person’s employment.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is periodically involved in various litigation claims asserted in the normal course of business.

The\nsettlement agreement was subject to certain terms and conditions and received final approval by the Court on December 16, 2022. At that time, a final\njudgment was entered dismissing the case, with the Court retaining jurisdiction over the action for purposes of enforcing the terms of the class settlement\nagreement.

Tex. filed September 26, 2023). On October 5, 2023, the court approved the final judgment with no penalties assessed\nagainst the Company.\nStockholder Derivative Claim\nOn June 3, 2022, a verified stockholder derivative complaint was filed in U.S. District Court, District of Delaware by the Plaintiff Stockholder on behalf of\nIntrusion against certain of the Company’s Defendants. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants through various actions breached their fiduciary duties, wasted\ncorporate assets, and unjustly enriched Defendants by (a) incurring costs and expenses in connection with the ongoing SEC investigation, (b) incurring costs\nand expenses to defend the Company with respect to the consolidated class action, (c) settling class-wide liability with respect to the consolidated class action,\nas well as ancillary claims regarding sales of the Company’s common stock by certain of the Defendants. On September 28, 2023, the Company agreed to settle\nthe claim. On October 2, 2023, public notice of the settlement was given.

(the \"Company\") is committed to strong corporate governance. As part of this commitment, the Company's Board of Directors (the\n\"Board\") has adopted this Compensation Recovery Policy (the \"Policy\"). The Policy is intended to further the Company's pay-for performance philosophy and\nto comply with applicable law by providing for the reasonably prompt recovery of certain incentive-based compensation received by Executive Officers in the\nevent of an Accounting Restatement.\nCapitalized terms used in the Policy are defined below, and the definitions have substantive impact on its application, so reviewing them carefully is\nimportant to your understanding. The application of the Policy to Executive Officers is not discretionary, except to the limited extent provided below, and\napplies without regard to whether an Executive Officer was at fault.\nThe Policy is intended to comply with, and will be interpreted in a manner consistent with, Section 1OD of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the\n\"Exchange Act\"), with Exchange Act Rule 1OD- I and with the listing standards of the national securities exchange (the \"Exchange\") on which the securities of\nthe Company are listed, including any interpretive guidance provided by the Exchange.\nPersons Covered by the Policy\nThe Policy is binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers. \"Executive Officer\" means each individual who is or was ever designated as an\n\"officer\" by the Board in accordance with Exchange Act Rule 16a-l(f). Each Executive Officer will be required to sign and return to the Company an\nacknowledgement that such Executive Officer will be bound by the terms and comply with the Policy. The failure to obtain such acknowledgement will have\nno impact on the applicability or enforceability of the Policy.\nAdministration of the Policy\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board (the \"Committee\") has full delegated authority to administer the Policy. The Committee is authorized to\ninterpret and construe the Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of the Policy. In addition, if\ndetermined in the discretion of the Board, the Policy may be administered by the independent members of the Board or another committee of the Board made\nup of independent members of the Board, in which case all references to the Committee will be deemed to refer to the independent members of the Board or\nthe other Board committee. All determinations of the Committee will be final and binding and will be given the maximum deference permitted by law.\nAccounting Restatements Requiring Application of the Policy\nIf the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance by the Company with any financial reporting\nrequirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is\nmaterial to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left\nuncorrected in the current period (an \"Accounting Restatement\"), then the Committee must determine the Excess Compensation, if any, that must be recovered.\nThe Company's obligation to recover Excess Compensation is not dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are filed.\n1\nCompensation Covered by the Policy\nThe Policy applies to certain Incentive-Based Compensation that is Received on or after December 1, 2023 (the \"Effective Date\"), during the Covered\nPeriod while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange. The Incentive-Based Compensation is considered \"Clawback\nEligible Incentive-Based Compensation\" if the Incentive-Based Compensation is Received by a person after such person became an Executive Officer and the\nperson served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period to which the Incentive-Based Compensation applies. The \"Excess\nCompensation\" that is subject to recovery under the Policy is the amount of Clawback Eligible Incentive-Based Compensation that exceeds the amount of\nClawback Eligible Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been Received had such Clawback Eligible Incentive-Based Compensation been\ndetermined based on the restated amounts (this is referred to in the listings standards as \"erroneously awarded incentive based compensation\").\nTo determine the amount of Excess Compensation for Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where it is not\nsubject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, the amount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the\neffect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received and the\nCompany must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide the documentation to the Exchange.\n\"Incentive-Based Compensation\" means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial\nReporting Measure. For the avoidance of doubt, no compensation that is potentially subject to recovery under the Policy will be earned until the Company's\nright to recover under the Policy has lapsed.\nThe following items of compensation are not Incentive-Based Compensation under the Policy: Salaries, bonuses paid solely at the discretion of the\nCommittee or Board that are not paid from a bonus pool that is determined by satisfying a Financial Reporting Measure, bonuses paid solely upon satisfying\none or more subjective standards and/or completion of a specified employment period, non-equity incentive plan awards earned solely upon satisfying one or\nmore strategic measures or operational measures, and equity awards for which the grant is not contingent upon achieving any Financial Reporting Measure\nperformance goal and vesting is contingent solely upon completion of a specified employment period (e.g., time-based vesting equity awards) and/or attaining\none or more non-Financial Reporting Measures.\n\"Financial Reporting Measures\" are measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the\nCompany's financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return are also\nFinancial Reporting Measures. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission.\nIncentive-Based Compensation is \"Received\" under the Policy in the Company's fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified\nin the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment, vesting, settlement or grant of the Incentive Based Compensation occurs after the\nend of that period. For the avoidance of doubt, the Policy does not apply to Incentive-Based Compensation for which the Financial Reporting Measure is\nattained prior to the Effective Date.\n\"Covered Period\" means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Accounting Restatement Determination Date. In addition,\nCovered Period can include certain transition periods resulting from a change in the Company's fiscal year.\n\"Accounting Restatement Determination Date\" means the earliest to occur of: (a) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or one or more of the\nofficers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is\nrequired to prepare an Accounting Restatement; and (b) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an\nAccounting Restatement.\n2\nRepayment of Excess Compensation\nThe Company must recover Excess Compensation reasonably promptly and Executive Officers are required to repay Excess Compensation to the\nCompany. Subject to applicable law, the Company may recover Excess Compensation by requiring the Executive Officer to repay such amount to the Company\nby direct payment to the Company or such other means or combination of means as the Committee determines to be appropriate (these determinations do not\nneed to be identical as to each Executive Officer). These means may include:\n(a) requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive-Based Compensation previously paid;\n(b) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards;\n(c) offsetting the amount to be recovered from any unpaid or future compensation to be paid by the Company or any affiliate of the Company to the\nExecutive Officer;\n(d) cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\n(e) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Committee.\nThe repayment of Excess Compensation must be made by an Executive Officer notwithstanding any Executive Officer's belief (whether or not\nlegitimate) that the Excess Compensation had been previously earned under applicable law and therefore is not subject to clawback.\nTo the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company for any erroneously awarded compensation received under any\nduplicative recovery obligations established by the Company or applicable law, it shall be appropriate for any such reimbursed\namount to be credited to the amount of erroneously awarded compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy.\nIn addition to its rights to recovery under the Policy, the Company may take any legal actions it determines appropriate to enforce an Executive\nOfficer's obligations to the Company or to discipline an Executive Officer, including (without limitation) termination of employment, reporting of misconduct\nto appropriate governmental authorities, reduction of future compensation opportunities or change in role. The decision to take any actions described in the\npreceding sentence will not be subject to the approval of the Committee and can be made by the Board, any committee of the Board. The applicable Executive\nOfficer shall be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such\nerroneously awarded compensation in accordance with this paragraph.\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the actions contemplated by this Section of the Policy if\nthe Committee (which, as specified above, is composed entirely of independent directors) determines that recovery would be impracticable and any of the\nfollowing two conditions are met:\n• The Committee has determined that the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to\nbe recovered, provided that, before making this determination, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover the erroneously\nawarded compensation, documented such attempt(s) and provided such documentation to the Exchange; or\n• Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the\nCompany, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and\nregulations thereunder; or\n• Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before concluding that it would be\nimpracticable to recover any amount of erroneously awarded compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company must\nobtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the Exchange, that recovery would result in such a violation, and must provide\nsuch opinion to Exchange.\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy required by applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") filings\nand rules.\n3\nLimited Exceptions to the Policy\nThe Company must recover Excess Compensation in accordance with the Policy except to the limited extent that the conditions set forth below are\nmet, and the Committee determines that recovery of the Excess Compensation would be impracticable:\n(a) The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before reaching this\nconclusion, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover the Excess Compensation, document the reasonable attempt(s) taken to so\nrecover, and provide that documentation to the Exchange; or\n(b) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the\nCompany, to fail to meet the legal requirements as such.\nOther Important Information in the Policy\nThe Policy is in addition to the requirements of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are applicable to the Company's Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as any other applicable laws, regulatory requirements, or rules.\nNotwithstanding the terms of any of the Company's organizational documents (including, but not limited to, the Company's certificate of incorporation\nand bylaws), any corporate policy or any contract (including, but not limited to, any indemnification agreement), neither the Company nor any affiliate of the\nCompany will indemnify or provide advancement for any Executive Officer against any loss of Excess Compensation. Neither the Company nor any affiliate of\nthe Company will pay for or reimburse insurance premiums for an insurance policy that covers potential recovery obligations. In the event that pursuant to the\nPolicy the Company is required to recover Excess Compensation from an Executive Officer who is no longer an employee, the Company will be entitled to\nseek recovery in order to comply with applicable law, regardless of the terms of any release of claims or separation agreement such individual may have\nsigned.\nThe Committee or Board may review and modify the Policy from time to time.\nIf any provision of the Policy or the application of any such provision to any Executive Officer is adjudicated to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in\nany respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provisions of the Policy or the application of such provision to another\nExecutive Officer, and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to render any such provision\nor application enforceable.\nThe Policy will terminate and no longer be enforceable when the Company ceases to be a listed issuer within the meaning of Section 1OD of the\nExchange Act.\nMandatory Disclosures\nThe Company shall file this Policy as an exhibit to its Annual Report on Form 10-K and, if applicable, disclose information relating to the occurrence\nof an accounting restatement in accordance with applicable law, including, but not limited to, the rules of the Exchange, and the Exchange Act.\nIn the event the Company is required to clawback any erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation from Executive Officers in accordance with\nthe rules of the Exchange and the Exchange Act., and the occurrence of such is disclosed by the Company in a public filing required by the Exchange Act, the\nCompany will disclose (i) the aggregate amount recovered, or (ii) if no amount was recovered, the absence of a recoverable amount.\n4\nNoncompliance\nFailure by the Company to adhere to this policy governing the recovery of erroneously awarded compensation could result in the Company being\nsubject to delisting from the Exchange.\nAmendment and Termination\nThe Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary. Notwithstanding anything\nherein to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any\nactions taken by the Company contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule or\nNasdaq rules. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time.\n***\n5\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n• I acknowledge that I have received and read the Compensation Recovery Policy (the \"Policy\") oflntrusion, Inc.
