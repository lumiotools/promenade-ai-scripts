These improved \u0000nancial results did not include any impact from Terri\u0000er 3, which was released in our\n\u0000scal 3rd quarter and therefore will begin to be re\u0000ected in our next quarterly report.\nAfter debuting in North American theaters on October 11 and displacing Joker: Folie a Deux at the top of the box\no\u0000ce charts, Cineverse's low budget horror phenomenon Terri\u0000er 3 has rolled on to become the highest-\ngrossing non-rated \u0000lm ever (topping previous record-holder Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé), having amassed\nmore than $54 million domestically to date. In addition to a continued theatrical run, which may include a special\n1\nChristmas re-issue, Terri\u0000er 3 will also soon enter the Digital Sales, BluRay/DVD and the Streaming/Pay\ndistribution channels, including our Screambox channel, and is expected to have a major positive \u0000nancial\nimpact on our \u0000scal 3rd quarter and beyond. Revenues from the theatrical release alone are expected to exceed\n$20 million in the 3rd quarter. We plan on detailing all of the positive impacts on both our income statement and\nbalance sheet from the Terri\u0000er franchise in our next quarterly earnings report.\nQ2 FY 2025 Highlights (all comparisons are to the prior year \u0000scal quarter ended September\n30, 2023, or Q2 FY 2024):\nTotal revenue was $12.7 million versus $13.0 million in the prior year quarter, which included $2.4 million of non-\nrecurring, non-cash revenue related to Digital Cinema. Excluding the prior year quarter's Digital Cinema revenues,\nour total revenue for the quarter increased $2.2 million, or 20%. In addition, compared to the last quarter ended\nJune 30, 2024, our revenues increased by $3.6 million, or 40%.\nQ2 FY 2025 revenues include $1.6 million of licensing revenue associated with the licensing of the Dog\nWhisperer with Cesar Millan channel.\nTotal monthly viewership across our channel portfolio increased 54% versus the same period last year, driven\nin large part by successful new channel launches such as Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan and Gar\u0000eld and\nFriends. In addition, Dove Channel viewership increased 54% for the same comparable periods. Combined\nwith the rapid growth of our podcast business, where revenues were up 98% versus last year and we now\nhave 51 podcasts airing, this should set the stage for our new ad sales team to drive signi\u0000cant growth over\nthe next few quarters, particularly through direct ad sales.\nDriven by the increase in recurring revenue from the prior year quarter, the Company's direct operating expenses\nincreased by $1.6 million, for a direct operating margin of 51%, which exceeds our previously stated margin target\nof 45% to 50%. Excluding the impact of Digital Cinema revenue in the prior year quarter, our direct operating\nmargin improved from 44% to 51%.\nSG&A expenses decreased $0.5 million, or 7%, primarily due to the Company's continued focus on cost savings\ninitiatives in addition to savings realized from its o\u0000shoring program to Cineverse Services India.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders was $1.4 million, or $(0.09) per share, compared to a net loss of $0.4\nmillion, or $(0.04) per share, in the prior year quarter primarily due to last year's recognition of signi\u0000cant legacy\nDigital Cinema business revenues.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by $1.8 million to $0.5 million primarily driven by $2.4 million of non-recurring, non-\ncash revenue in the prior year quarter related to Digital Cinema.\n2\nFinancial condition overview:\nCash and cash equivalents of $2.4 million and $2.9 million of unused capacity under our line of credit facility\nas of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company's Digital content library comprised of approximately 66,000 titles was valued as of March 31,\n2024, at approximately $40 million, a signi\u0000cant increase over the 2023 valuation and well above the $2.5\nmillion book value of the library as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company continued to execute on its previously approved share repurchase program and acquired\napproximately 31,000 thousand shares through September 30, 2024. The previously reported share\nrepurchase program remains in place and will continue to be utilized as appropriate.\nOperational Developments During the Quarter\nTerri\u0000er 3 premiered at Fantastic Fest with unprecedented positive early reactions ahead of the October 11\nwide theatrical release – Fans and Critics Praised the \u0000lm as \"A Blood-soaked Triumph!\"\nReleased o\u0000cial trailer and key art for Terri\u0000er 3 – garnering over 14 million views across social media, and\ncoverage from major outlets including Cosmopolitan, Collider, AV Club, USA Today and Yahoo!

We grew total revenues by 20% excluding the legacy Digital Cinema business, we generated a total\noperating margin of 51%, again exceeding our stated margin goals, we continued to signi\u0000cantly reduce SG&A costs\nand we generated positive Adjusted EBITDA of $0.5 million. Our content licensing, advertising, technology and\nstreaming businesses all contributed to these positive results, which bodes very well for continued future success\"\n\"Released into theaters on October 11, Terri\u0000er 3 took the entire \u0000lm world by surprise, supplanting Joker: Folie a\nDeaux at the top of the domestic box o\u0000ce charts with an almost $19 million \u0000rst weekend opening despite micro\nspending levels from a production and marketing standpoint versus industry norms. The \u0000lm continues to shock\nand awe the \u0000lm world, rolling on to more than $54 million at the domestic box o\u0000ce to date, with Digital,\nDVD/BluRay and Streaming/Pay releases upcoming shortly. Terri\u0000er 3 will have a major impact on both our\nincome statement and balance sheet beginning in our next reported \u0000scal quarter and beyond. For instance, we\nexpect to record at least $20 million in just theatrical rental revenues alone in the next reported quarter and record\nsigni\u0000cant additional revenue and high margin pro\u0000t streams from the domestic ancillary markets as well. We\nexpect the pro\u0000ts and cash \u0000ow generated from Terri\u0000er 3 will be a major factor in realizing our goal of a\nsustainable, self-funding balance sheet for our ongoing operations and as such, we currently see no need to raise\nany outside equity capital to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.\"\n4\n\"Beyond the signi\u0000cant \u0000nancial upside, the tremendous success of Terri\u0000er 3 has established a potential new\nblueprint in the industry for the theatrical release of independent \u0000lms with a much more risk-advantaged\neconomic pro\u0000le than ever before. We believe this can become a major upside for the independent \u0000lm business\nand independent \u0000lmmakers going forward. Essentially, Cineverse used the entertainment and technology assets\nwe built over the years, our MatchpointTM technology, our targeted fan-centric streaming channel portfolio with\nmore than 80 million monthly viewers, our social media footprint including online leader Bloody Disgusting and\nour top 10 podcast network to open a movie to #1 at the domestic box o\u0000ce amidst an array of wide-\nrelease, mega-spending major studio movies, for well below $1 million in out-of-pocket marketing costs. At the\nsame time, we estimate that we generated well over $5 million in media value through the Cineverse ecosystem.\nThat is a previously unheard-of feat in the entertainment business, and we intend to both release more of our own\n\u0000lms using this model as well as other studio's releases that can potentially take advantage of our unique array of\nassets to market and distribute their \u0000lms, creating a new pro\u0000t line for the Company. Our recent announcement\nthat we are going to distribute on a worldwide basis the remake of the controversial horror classic Silent Night\nDeadly Night is the \u0000rst step in that regard.\"\nErick Opeka, President and CSO of Cineverse, stated, \"This quarter marks a transformative period for Cineverse\nas we expand our capabilities across podcasting, technology, and streaming. With our podcast network now\nranking among the top 10 by audience, driving 98% revenue growth, we're positioned to deliver substantial value to\nour audiences and advertisers. Recent technological advances, including our cineSearch AI product and initial\nMatchpointTM deals closed this quarter, demonstrate our commitment to innovation, with a robust pipeline\nexpected to drive further growth in the coming quarters. Partnerships with leaders like Google further strengthen\nour position in the tech-driven future of entertainment.\nOur proprietary C360 platform, which now processes over 20 billion ad requests per month and achieved record\nresults in October, enables us to reach and engage passionate fan communities at a fraction of Hollywood's typical\nmarketing spend. This highly e\u0000cient approach delivers signi\u0000cantly greater returns for both talent and Cineverse,\nas seen with the success of Terri\u0000er 3. We are eager to expand on this approach as we build out our \u0000lm\nreleasing slate for the next \u0000scal year and beyond.\n\"We are also advancing exciting opportunities in AI, leveraging our extensive content library and MatchpointTM\ntechnology. Currently, we're in discussions with multiple parties to license parts of our library for AI training\npurposes and are \u0000nalizing partnerships to represent and process AI training rights and data for a wide array of\nglobal rights holders. This initiative could dramatically expand our existing library of over 66,000 titles, positioning\nus at the forefront of training data licensing.\n\"In our streaming business, our channel portfolio has driven exceptional engagement and \u0000nancial performance,\n5\ncontributing to a 73% year-over-year increase in viewership. Notably, The Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan\nchannel generated more than $1.6 million in licensing revenue alone, quickly becoming one of our top revenue-\ngenerating channels in the portfolio, and we anticipate continued growth in this channel as we further expand its\ndistribution.\nBy tapping into our engaged audiences, smart streaming tech, and targeted advertising, Cineverse has built a real\ncompetitive edge as a next-generation studio. This approach lets us connect releases directly with fan communities,\nreach audiences e\u0000ciently, and keep costs down—all while growing and driving pro\u0000ts. We're setting a new\nstandard for how a modern studio can thrive.\nConference Call\nCineverse will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET (Thursday, November 14, 2024), during which management will\ndiscuss the results of the \u0000scal second quarter ended September 30, 2024.

We use Adjusted EBITDA as a \u0000nancial metric to measure the \u0000nancial\nperformance of the business because management believes it provides additional information with respect to the\nperformance of its fundamental business activities. For this reason, we believe Adjusted EBITDA will also be useful\nto others, including our stockholders, as a valuable \u0000nancial metric.\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplement to net income (loss)\nfrom continuing operations as an indicator of operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a\n\u0000nancial measure that is useful both to management and investors when evaluating our performance and\ncomparing our performance with that of our competitors. We also use Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes and\nto evaluate our \u0000nancial performance because Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain incremental expenses or non-cash\nitems, such as stock-based compensation charges, that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating\nperformance.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure and not a liquidity measure, and therefore a\nreconciliation between net income (loss) from operations and Adjusted EBITDA has been provided in the \u0000nancial\nresults. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) from operations as an\nindicator of performance or as an alternative to cash \u0000ows from operating activities as an indicator of cash \u0000ows, in\neach case as determined in accordance with GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does\nnot take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can a\u0000ect\ncash \u0000ows. We do not intend the presentation of these non-GAAP measures to be considered in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should be read only in\nconjunction with our consolidated \u0000nancial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFollowing is the reconciliation of our consolidated net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet Loss $ (1,203) $ (317) $ (4,253) $ (3,853)\nAdd Backs:\nIncome tax expense 6 16 13 36\nDepreciation and amortization 974 953 1,837 1,775\nInterest expense 338 195 768 490\nStock-based compensation 503 499 973 909\nLoss from equity investment in Metaverse (1) 718 (4) 718\nOther (income) expense, net — (26) (163) 148\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest (84) (40) (106) (53)\nTransition-related costs — 368 27 835\nAdj t dEBITDA 9\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 533 $ 2,366 $ (909) $ 1,005\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cineverse-reports-\nsecond-quarter-\u0000scal-year-2025-results-302306355.html\nSOURCE Cineverse Corp.\n10"

STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND LIQUIDITY\nCineverse Corp. (“Cineverse”, “us”, “our”, \"we\", and “Company” refers to Cineverse Corp. and its subsidiaries\nunless the context otherwise requires) was incorporated in Delaware on March 31, 2000. Since our inception, we\nhave played a role in the digital distribution revolution that continues to transform the media and entertainment\nlandscape.\nCineverse is a streaming technology and entertainment company with its core business operating as (i) a portfolio of\nowned and operated streaming channels with enthusiast fan bases; (ii) a large-scale global aggregator and full-\nservice distributor of feature films and television programs; and (iii) a proprietary technology software-as-a-service\nplatform for over-the-top (“OTT”) app development and content distribution through subscription video on demand\n(\"SVOD\"), dedicated ad-supported video on demand (\"AVOD\"), ad-supported streaming linear (\"FAST\") channels,\nsocial video streaming services, and audio podcasts. Our streaming channels reach audiences in several distinct\nways: direct-to-consumer, through these major application platforms, and through third party distributors of content\non platforms.\nThe Company’s streaming technology platform, known as MatchpointTM, is a software-based streaming operating\nplatform which provides clients with AVOD, SVOD, transactional video on demand (\"TVOD\") and linear\ncapabilities, automates the distribution of content, and features a robust data analytics platform.\nWe distribute products for major brands such as Hallmark, ITV, Nelvana, ZDF, Konami, NFL and Highlander, as\nwell as international and domestic content creators, movie producers, television producers and other short-form\ndigital content producers. We collaborate with producers, major brands and other content owners to market, source,\ncurate and distribute quality content to targeted audiences through (i) existing and emerging digital home\nentertainment platforms, including but not limited to Apple iTunes, Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Xbox, Pluto, and\nTubi, as well as (ii) physical goods, including DVD and Blu-ray Discs.\nOur Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \"Common Stock\") is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market\n(“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “CNVS.”\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nWe have a history of net losses and we may continue to generate net losses for the foreseeable future. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $509 million and a working capital deficit of $1.2\nmillion. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss attributable to\nCommon Stockholders of $1.4 million and $4.5 million, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities for the\nsix months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.4 million, which included $1.7 million of incremental investment in\nour content portfolio via advances or minimum guarantee payouts.\nThe Company is party to a Loan, Guaranty, and Security Agreement, as amended, with EWB providing for a $7.5\nmillion Line of Credit Facility, guaranteed by substantially all of our material subsidiaries and secured by\nsubstantially all of our and our subsidiaries’ assets. The Line of Credit Facility bears interest at a rate equal to 1.5%\nabove the prime rate, equal to 9.5% as of September 30, 2024. The Line of Credit Facility matures on September 15,\n2025. As of September 30, 2024, $4.6 million was outstanding on the Line of Credit Facility, net of unamortized\nissuance costs of $180 thousand.\nOn April 5, 2024, Cineverse Terrifier LLC (“T3 Borrower”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered\ninto a Loan and Security Agreement with BondIt LLC (“T3 Lender”) and the Company, as a guarantor (the “T3\nLoan Agreement”). The T3 Loan Agreement provides for a term loan with a principal amount not to exceed $3,666\nthousand (the “T3 Loan”), and a maturity date of April 1, 2025, unless extended for 120 days under certain\nconditions. The T3 Loan bears no interest until the maturity date other than an interest advance equal to $576\nthousand paid at the closing of the T3 Loan on April 5, 2024. After the principal of the T3 Loan is paid in full, the\nT3 Lender will be entitled to receive 15% of all royalties earned by the Company on the film titled Terrifier 3 (the\n\"Film\") under its distribution agreements until the T3 Lender has received 1.75 times of the full commitment amount\nof $3,666 thousand consisting of principal plus interest and fees advanced to the T3 Borrower, plus any\n8\nCINEVERSE CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nextension interest. The T3 Loan is presented as current within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance\nSheets and has a balance of $3.1 million as of September 30, 2024. See Note 5 - Debt, for further information.\nOn May 3, 2024, the Company entered into a sales agreement (the “2024 Sales Agreement”) with A.G.P./Alliance\nGlobal Partners and The Benchmark Company, LLC (collectively, the “Sales Agents”), pursuant to which the\nCompany may offer and sell, from time to time, through the Sales Agents, shares of Common Stock. Shares of\nCommon Stock may be offered and sold for an aggregate offering price of up to $15 million. The Sales Agents’\nobligations to sell shares under the 2024 Sales Agreement are subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including\nthe continuing effectiveness of the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-273098) (the\n“Registration Statement”) filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on\nJune 30, 2023 and declared effective by the SEC on January 25, 2024, and other customary closing conditions. The\nCompany will pay the Sales Agents a commission of 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of shares\nand has agreed to provide the Sales Agents with customary indemnification and contribution rights. The Company\nhas also agreed to reimburse the Sales Agents for certain specified expenses. The Company is not obligated to sell\nany shares under the 2024 Sales Agreement and has not sold any shares through the date of this report.\nThe Company will continue to invest in content development and acquisition, from which it believes it will obtain\nan appropriate return on its investment. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, short term content advances\nwere $10.8 million and $9.3 million, respectively, and content advances, net of the current portion, were $1.5\nmillion and $2.6 million, respectively.\nOur capital requirements will depend on many factors, and we may need to use existing capital resources and/or\nundertake equity or debt offerings, if necessary and opportunistically available, for further capital needs. We believe\nour cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and availability under our Line of Credit Facility will be\nsufficient to support our operations for at least twelve months from the filing of this report.\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nConsolidation\nThe accompanying interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Cineverse Corp. have been prepared in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and are consistent in all\nmaterial respects with those applied in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31,\n2024 filed with the SEC on July 1, 2024. These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited and\nhave been prepared by the Company following the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nCertain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with\nGAAP have been condensed or omitted as permitted by such rules and regulations; however, the Company believes\nthe disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Certain columns and rows may not\nfoot due to the use of rounded numbers.\nThe interim financial information is unaudited, but reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion\nof management, necessary to fairly present the information set forth herein. The interim Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related\nnotes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. Interim results\nare not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year.\nThe preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires\nmanagement to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and accompanying notes. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include\nrevenue recognition, allowance for credit losses, returns and recovery reserves, goodwill and intangible asset\nimpairments, share-based compensation expense, valuation allowance for deferred income taxes and amortization of\nintangible assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that\nthe Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On a regular basis, the Company evaluates these\nassumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n9\nCINEVERSE CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nWe own an 85% interest in CON TV, LLC (\"CONtv\"), a worldwide digital network that creates original content, and\nsells and distributes on-demand digital content on the internet and other consumer digital distribution platforms,\nsuch as gaming consoles, set-top boxes, handsets, and tablets. We evaluated the investment under the voting interest\nentity model and determined that the entity should be consolidated as we have a controlling financial interest in the\nentity through our ownership of outstanding voting shares, and that other equity holders do not have substantive\nvoting, participating or liquidation rights.\nAccounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies as compared to the\nsignificant accounting policies described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March\n31, 2024.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company manages its operations and its business in one reporting segment.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be “cash equivalents.”\nWe maintain bank accounts with major banks, which from time to time may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation’s insured limits. We periodically assess the financial condition of the institutions and believe that the\nrisk of any loss is minimal.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation\nexpense is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:\nComputer equipment and software 3 - 5 years\nInternal use software 3 - 5 years\nMachinery and equipment 3 - 10 years\nFurniture and fixtures 2 - 7 years\nWe capitalize costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use when the preliminary project\nstage is completed, and it is determined that the software will provide significantly enhanced capabilities and\nmodifications. These capitalized costs are included in property and equipment, net and include external direct cost of\nservices procured in developing or obtaining internal-use software and personnel and related expenses for\nemployees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to internal-use software projects. Capitalization of\nthese costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended use. Once the\nsoftware is ready for its intended use, the costs are amortized over the useful life of the software. Post-configuration\ntraining and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

The determination of the predominant monetization strategy is made at\ncommencement of the production or license period and the classification of the monetization strategy as individual\nor group only changes if there is a significant change to the title’s monetization strategy relative to its initial\nassessment. The costs are capitalized as Capitalized Content costs within Intangible Assets and are amortized as a\ngroup within Depreciation and Amortization on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nImpairment of Long-lived and Finite-lived Intangible Assets\nWe review the recoverability of our long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets, when events or conditions\noccur that indicate a possible impairment exists. The assessment for recoverability is based primarily on our ability\nto recover the carrying value of our long-lived and finite-lived assets from expected future undiscounted net cash\nflows. If the total of expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the total carrying value of the asset, the\nasset is deemed not to be recoverable and possibly impaired. We then estimate the fair value of the asset to\ndetermine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. An impairment loss will be recognized if the asset’s\nfair value is determined to be less than its carrying value. Fair value is determined by computing the expected future\ndiscounted cash flows. There were no impairment charges recorded for long-lived and finite-lived intangible assets\nduring the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of an acquired business.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in\ncircumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value, also known as impairment indicators.\nInherent in the fair value determination for each reporting unit are certain judgments and estimates relating to future\ncash flows, including management’s interpretation of current economic indicators and market conditions, and\nassumptions about our strategic plans with regard to its operations. To the extent additional information arises,\nmarket conditions change, or our strategies change, it is possible that the conclusion regarding whether our\nremaining goodwill is impaired could change and result in future goodwill impairment charges that will have a\nmaterial effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nThe Company has the option to assess goodwill for possible impairment by performing a qualitative analysis to\ndetermine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to\nperform the quantitative impairment test. The Company annually assesses goodwill for potential impairment during\nits fourth fiscal quarter, or sooner if events occur or circumstances would indicate it would be more likely than not\nthat fair value would be reduced below its carrying amount. For the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company\nrecognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14 million. No goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the three\nand six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n12\nCINEVERSE CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair value measurement disclosures are grouped into three levels based on valuation factors:\n• Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical investments\n• Level 2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments and market\ncorroborated inputs)\n• Level 3 – significant unobservable inputs (including our own assumptions in determining the fair value of\ninvestments)\nThe following tables summarize the levels of fair value measurements of our financial assets and liabilities (in\nthousands):\nAs of September 30, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nEquity investment in Metaverse, at fair value $ 160 $ — $ — $ 160\n$ 160 $ — $ — $ 160\nLiabilities:\nCurrent portion of earnout consideration on purchase\nof a business $ — $ — $ — $ —\n$ — $ — $ — $ —\nAs of March 31, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nEquity investment in Metaverse, at fair value $ 362 $ — $ — $ 362\n$ 362 $ — $ — $ 362\nLiabilities:\nCurrent portion of earnout consideration on purchase\nof a business $ — $ — $ 180 $ 180\n$ — $ — $ 180 $ 180\nOur cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses are financial\ninstruments and are recorded at cost in the consolidated balance sheets.

Base\ndistribution revenue relates to non-streaming revenue, including Theatrical revenue and the sale of DVD's. Podcast\nand other revenue primarily relate to the Company's Bloody Disgusting Podcast Network. As the Company satisfies\nits performance obligations from these revenue sources, whether relating to the delivery of digital content, physical\ngoods, or licensing, revenue is generally measured at a point in time.\nOther non-recurring revenue relates to the Company's legacy digital cinema operations, whose operations have run-\noff, still may generate non-recurring revenue from the sale of cinema assets or the recognition of variable\nconsideration as the associated uncertainty associated with the revenue is resolved.\nThe Company follows the five-step model established by Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\")\nAccounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, Revenue from contracts with customers (\"ASC 606\") when\npreparing its assessment of revenue recognition.\nPrincipal Agent Considerations\nRevenue earned from the delivery of digital content and physical goods may be recognized gross or net\ndepending on the terms of the arrangement. We determine whether revenue should be reported on a gross or\nnet basis based on each revenue stream. Key indicators that we use in evaluating gross versus net treatment\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\n• which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or\nservice; and\n• which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling costs are incurred to move physical goods (e.g., DVDs and Blu-ray Discs) to\ncustomers. We recognize all shipping and handling costs as an expense in direct operating expenses\nbecause we are responsible for delivery of the product to our customers prior to transfer of control to the\ncustomer.\n15\nCINEVERSE CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nCredit Losses\nWe maintain reserves for expected credit losses on accounts receivable primarily on a specific identification\nbasis. We review the composition of accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts, customer\nconcentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment\npatterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves.\nWe recognize accounts receivable, net of an estimated allowance for product returns and customer\nchargebacks, at the time that we recognize revenue from a sale. Reserves for product returns and other\nallowances are variable consideration as part of the transaction price. If actual future returns and allowances\ndiffer from past experience, adjustments to our allowances may be required.\nDuring the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a reduction in its\nprovision for credit losses of $30 thousand and $185 thousand, respectively. During the three and six\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, we did not recognize any credit losses as part of its ongoing operations\nor reversals of previously recorded provisions.\nA summary of the movements of our allowances for credit losses follows (in thousands):\nAllowance for credit losses at the beginning of the year $ 269\nDecrease in estimated provision (185)\nAllowance for credit losses as at September 30, 2024 $ 84\nContract Liabilities\nWe generally record a receivable related to revenue when we have an unconditional right to invoice and\nreceive payment, and we record deferred revenue (contract liability) when cash payments are received or\ndue in advance of our performance, such as the sale of DVDs with future release dates, even if amounts are\nrefundable. Amounts recorded as contract liabilities are generally not long-term in nature.\nThe ending deferred revenue balance, including current and non-current balances as of September 30, 2024\nand March 31, 2024, was $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively. In each period, the additions to our\ndeferred revenue balance are due to cash payments received or due in advance of satisfying performance\nobligations, while the reductions are due to the recognition of revenue upon fulfillment of our performance\nobligations, both of which were in the ordinary course of business.\nParticipations and Royalties Payable\nWhen we use third parties to distribute Company-owned content, we record participations payable, which\nrepresent amounts owed to the distributor under revenue-sharing arrangements. When we provide content\ndistribution services, we record accounts payable and accrued expenses to studios or content producers for\nroyalties owed under licensing arrangements. We identify and record as a reduction to the liability any\nexpenses that are to be reimbursed to us by such studios or content producers.\nConcentrations\nFor the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, customers that individually account for greater\nthan 10% collectively represented 45% (three customers) and 32% (two customers) of consolidated\nrevenues. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, one customer represented 25% and 24%\nof consolidated revenues, respectively.\n16\nCINEVERSE CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nDirect Operating Expenses\nDirect operating expenses consist of cost of revenue, fulfillment expenses, shipping costs, property taxes and\ninsurance on systems, royalty expenses, reserves against advances and marketing and direct personnel costs.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company issues stock-based awards to employees and non-employees, generally in the form of restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units, stock appreciation rights (\"SARs\") and performance stock units (\"PSUs\"). The Company\naccounts for its stock-based compensation awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock\nCompensation (“ASC 718”). ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments, including grants of stock options and\nrestricted stock units and modifications to existing stock options, to be recognized in the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss based on their fair values. The Company measures the\ncompensation expense of employee and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of equity\ninstruments based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. That cost is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the period during which the employee or non-employee is required to provide service in exchange for the\naward. The fair values of options and SARs are calculated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option\npricing model based on key assumptions such as stock price, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected term.\nThe Company’s estimates of these assumptions are primarily based on the trading price of the Company’s stock,\nhistorical data, peer company data and judgment regarding future trends and factors. Forfeitures are recognized as\nthey occur.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets\nand liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit\ncarryforwards and for differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective\ntax basis.\nValuation allowances are established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that\nsome portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will ultimately be realized. The Company is primarily subject to\nincome taxes in the United States and India.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with an amendment to FASB ASC Topic 740-10,\nIncome Taxes (Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes), which clarified the accounting for uncertainty in tax\npositions. This amendment provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the\nfinancial statements only if the position is “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained were it to be challenged by a\ntaxing authority. The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without\nregard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. If an uncertain tax position meets the “more-likely-\nthan-not” threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be recognized upon ultimate\nsettlement with the taxing authority is recorded. The Company had no uncertain tax positions as of September 30,\n2024 and March 31, 2024.\n17\nCINEVERSE CORP.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nEarnings per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock\noutstanding during the period.

Potentially dilutive common shares include stock options and\nwarrants outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive common shares are\nexcluded from the computations of diluted income (loss) per share if their effect would be anti-dilutive.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report.\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These include statements\nabout our expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, which are indicated by words or phrases such as\n“believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “will,” “estimates,” and similar words. Forward-looking statements\nrepresent, as of the date of this report, our judgment relating to, among other things, future results of operations, growth plans,\nsales, capital requirements and general industry and business conditions applicable to us. These forward-looking statements are\nnot guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, some of which are\nbeyond our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking\nstatements.\nBusiness Overview\nCineverse Corp. (“Cineverse”, “us”, “our”, \"we\", and “Company” refers to Cineverse Corp. and its subsidiaries unless the\ncontext otherwise requires) was incorporated in Delaware on March 31, 2000. Since our inception, we have played a role in\nthe digital distribution revolution that continues to transform the media and entertainment landscape.\nThe Company has a long legacy in using technology to transform the entertainment industry and played a pioneering role in\ntransitioning movie screens from traditional analog film prints to digital distribution. Over the past several years, Cineverse has\ntransformed itself from being a digital cinema equipment and physical content distributor to a leading independent streaming\ncompany.\nCineverse is a streaming technology and entertainment company with its core business operating as (i) a portfolio of owned and\noperated streaming channels with enthusiast fan bases; (ii) a large-scale global aggregator and full-service distributor of feature\nfilms and television programs; and (iii) a proprietary technology software-as-a-service platform for over-the-top (“OTT”) app\ndevelopment and content distribution through subscription video on demand (\"SVOD\"), dedicated ad-supported video on\ndemand (\"AVOD\"), ad-supported streaming linear (\"FAST\") channels, social video streaming services, and audio podcasts. Our\nstreaming channels reach audiences in several distinct ways: direct-to-consumer, through these major application platforms,\nand through third party distributors of content on platforms.\nThe Company’s streaming technology platform, known as MatchpointTM, is a software-based streaming operating platform\nwhich provides clients with AVOD, SVOD, transactional video on demand (\"TVOD\") and linear capabilities, automates the\ndistribution of content, and features a robust data analytics platform.\nWe distribute products for major brands such as Hallmark, ITV, Nelvana, ZDF, Konami, NFL and Highlander, as well as\ninternational and domestic content creators, movie producers, television producers and other short-form digital content\nproducers. We collaborate with producers, major brands and other content owners to market, source, curate and distribute\nquality content to targeted audiences through (i) existing and emerging digital home entertainment platforms, including but not\nlimited to Apple iTunes, Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Xbox, Pluto, and Tubi, as well as (ii) physical goods, including DVD\nand Blu-ray Discs.\n24\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nWe have a history of net losses and we may continue to generate net losses for the foreseeable future. As of September 30,\n2024, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $509 million and a working capital deficit of $1.2 million. For the three and\nsix months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss attributable to Common Stockholders of $1.4 million and\n$4.5 million, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.4 million,\nwhich included $1.7 million of incremental investment in our content portfolio via advances or minimum guarantee payouts.\nThe Company is party to a Loan, Guaranty, and Security Agreement, as amended, with EWB providing for a $7.5 million Line\nof Credit Facility, guaranteed by substantially all of our material subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our and our\nsubsidiaries’ assets. The Line of Credit Facility bears interest at a rate equal to 1.5% above the prime rate, equal to 9.5% as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. The Line of Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, $4.6 million was\noutstanding on the Line of Credit Facility, net of issuance costs of $180 thousand.\nOn April 5, 2024, T3 Borrower, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into the T3 Loan Agreement with the T3\nLender, and the Company as guarantor. The T3 Loan Agreement provides for the T3 Loan with a principal amount not to\nexceed $3.7 million, and a maturity date of April 1, 2025, with a permitted extension of the term for 120 days under certain\nconditions. The T3 Loan bears no interest until the maturity date other than an interest advance equal to $576 thousand at the\nclosing of the T3 Loan on April 5, 2024. The interest advance was recorded as a discount on the T3 Loan at inception and will\nbe amortized to interest expense and increase the loan amount over its term. If the T3 Loan is extended as noted above, the T3\nLoan will bear interest at a rate of 1.44% per month. The T3 Borrower may prepay the obligations under the T3 Loan, in full or\nin part, without penalty or premium. The proceeds under the T3 Loan Agreement are being used for the funding under the\nCompany’s distribution arrangements for the film titled Terrifier 3 (the “Film”). The T3 Loan Agreement contains customary\ncovenants, representation and warranties and events of default. The T3 Loan is presented as current within the Company's\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and has a balance of $3.1 million as of September 30, 2024.\nAfter the principal of the T3 Loan is paid in full, the T3 Lender will be entitled to receive 15% of all royalties earned by the\nCompany on the Film under its distribution agreements for the Film until the T3 Lender has received 1.75 times the full\ncommitment amount of $3.7 million, consisting of the principal amount plus interest and fees advanced to T3 Borrower, plus\nany extension interest. The T3 Loan is secured by a first priority interest in all of T3 Borrower’s rights and interest in the Film\nand the distribution agreements, including the proceeds to the T3 Borrower from the distribution of the Film. We expect the T3\nLoan to be fully paid off in December 2024 from Film proceeds.\nOn May 3, 2024, the Company entered into a sales agreement (the “2024 Sales Agreement”) with A.G.P./Alliance Global\nPartners and The Benchmark Company, LLC (collectively, the “Sales Agents”), pursuant to which the Company may offer and\nsell, from time to time, through the Sales Agents, shares of Common Stock. Shares of Common Stock may be offered and sold\nfor an aggregate offering price of up to $15 million. The Sales Agents’ obligations to sell shares under the 2024 Sales\nAgreement are subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including the continuing effectiveness of the Registration Statement\non Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-273098) (the “Registration Statement”) filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”) on June 30, 2023 and declared effective by the SEC on January 25, 2024, and other\ncustomary closing conditions. The Company will pay the Sales Agents a commission of 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds\nfrom each sale of shares and has agreed to provide the Sales Agents with customary indemnification and contribution rights.\nThe Company has also agreed to reimburse the Sales Agents for certain specified expenses. The Company is not obligated to\nsell any shares under the 2024 Sales Agreement and has not sold any shares through the date of this report.\nThe Company will continue to invest in content development and acquisition, from which it believes it will obtain an\nappropriate return on its investment. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, short term content advances were $10.8\nmillion and $9.3 million, respectively, and content advances, net of current portion, were $1.5 million and $2.6 million,\nrespectively.\nOur capital requirements will depend on many factors, and we may need to use existing capital resources and/or undertake\nequity or debt offerings, if necessary and opportunistically available, for further capital needs. We believe our cash and cash\nequivalents as of September 30, 2024 and availability under our Line of Credit Facility will be sufficient to support our\noperations for at least twelve months from the filing of this report.\n25\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“GAAP”). In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and\nestimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and\nthe related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other\nfactors that management believes to be relevant at the time our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared. On\na regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial\nstatements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be\ndetermined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be\nmaterial.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 – Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies, of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 1, Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements (Unaudited), of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Management believes that these policies are the\nmost critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management’s most\ndifficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are\ninherently uncertain. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit\nCommittee of our Board of Directors.\nResults of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nRevenues\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, As a % of Revenue\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023\nStreaming and digital $ 10,089 $ 9,355 $ 734 8% 79% 72%\nPodcast and other 1,273 660 613 93% 10% 5%\nBase distribution 1,321 560 761 136% 10% 4%\nOther non-recurring 56 2,437 (2,381) (98)% 0% 19%\nTotal Revenue $ 12,739 $ 13,012 $ (273) (2)% 100% 100%\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, total revenue declined by $0.3 million compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.

We use Adjusted EBITDA as a financial metric to measure the financial performance of the\nbusiness because management believes it provides additional information with respect to the performance of its fundamental\nbusiness activities. For this reason, we believe Adjusted EBITDA will also be useful to others, including our stockholders, as a\nvaluable financial metric.\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplement to net income (loss) from\ncontinuing operations as an indicator of operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure\nthat is useful both to management and investors when evaluating our performance and comparing our performance with that of\nour competitors. We also use Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes and to evaluate our financial performance because\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes certain incremental expenses or non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation charges, that\nwe believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure and not a liquidity measure, and therefore a reconciliation\nbetween net income (loss) from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA has been provided in the financial results.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) from operations as an indicator of\nperformance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of cash flows, in each case as\ndetermined in accordance with GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account\nchanges in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows. We do not intend the\npresentation of these non-GAAP measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should be read only in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFollowing is the reconciliation of our consolidated net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (1,203) $ (317) $ (4,253) $ (3,853)\nAdd Back:\nIncome tax expense 6 16 13 36\nDepreciation and amortization 974 953 1,837 1,775\nInterest expense 337 195 768 490\n(Gain) loss from equity investment in Metaverse (1) 718 (4) 718\nStock-based compensation 503 499 973 909\nOther (income) expense, net — (26) (163) 148\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest (84) (40) (106) (53)\nTransition-related costs — 368 27 835\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 532 $ 2,366 $ (908) $ 1,005\n29\nCash Flow\nChanges in our cash flows were as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Six Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nNet used in operating activities (2,381) (6,174)\nNet cash used in investing activities (820) (515)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 463 8,157\nNet Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents $ (2,738) $ 1,468\nFor the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by loss from\noperations, excluding non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, and other changes\nin working capital. Specifically, the adjustments are primarily driven by net cash outflows related to content advances made to\npartners for which initial expenditures are generally recovered within six to twelve months and operating prepayments,\npartially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable, the collection of the Company's ERTC claim, and a decrease in accounts\npayable and accrued expenses. Operating cash flows are typically seasonally lower during the first two fiscal quarters and\nhigher during our fiscal third and fourth quarters, resulting from revenues earned during the holiday season.\nCash used in investing activities was used in the expenditures towards long-lived assets as well as the sale of equity securities.\nCash provided by financing activities were primarily due to the receipt of funds from the T3 Loan offset by a net $1.6 million\nrepayment of the Line of Credit Facility, $0.3 million net payment of deferred acquisition consideration and $0.2 million used\nto repurchase outstanding shares.\nFor the six months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by loss from operations,\nexcluding non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, recovery for doubtful accounts and stock-based compensation,\nincluding capitalized content spend and other changes in working capital. Operating cash flows are typically seasonally lower\nduring the first two fiscal quarters and higher during our fiscal third and fourth quarters, resulting from revenues earned during\nthe holiday season. In addition, we made net advances of $5.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, as part of\nthe advances we make on theatrical releases and to certain home entertainment distribution clients for which initial\nexpenditures are generally recovered within six to twelve months. Cash used in investing activities was used in the\nexpenditures towards long-live intangible assets and fixed assets. Cash provided by financing activities pertained to the\nissuance of company equity, net of financing fees.\n30\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements other than as discussed in Note 2 – Basis of Presentation and\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies, Basis of Presentation and Consolidation and Note 3 - Other Interests to the\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we hold a 100%\nequity interest in CDF2 Holdings, which is an unconsolidated variable interest entity (“VIE”), which wholly owns Cinedigm\nDigital Funding 2, LLC; however, we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE.\nItem 4.

And Erick will provide some detail on our\nstreaming business results and operating initiatives before we open the floor to questions. I will\nnow turn the call over to Chris McGurk to begin.\nChris McGurk^ Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.\nWe reported a very strong second quarter of growth and financial improvement. Even without\nrecording a single dollar of financial results from our hugely successful box office Terrifier 3,\nwhere we control all domestic rights in the U.S. and Canada and which we released after the\nclose of this quarter.\nWe grew our revenues 20% versus last year in this quarter, excluding the impact of our legacy\nDigital Cinema business. In addition, we grew our revenues by 40% versus our last reported\nquarter ended June 30th, showing strong sequential business momentum.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nWe also exceeded our previously stated operating goals with a margin of 51%.\nWe continue to significantly reduce our SG&A costs and also generated positive adjusted\nEBITDA of more than $500,000.\nWe beat our analyst consensus guidance on every key financial metric.\nAdditionally, all our key operating metrics across our content licensing, technology, advertising,\nstreaming and podcast businesses continued to grow significantly during the quarter, which\nbodes very well our continued future success.\nMark and Erick will speak to all of that in just a few minutes.\nSo now let me take some time to discuss what I know is the number1 topic for most of our\ninvestors. The unprecedented success of our Terrifier horror film franchise and what it means for\nCineverse's future.\nFollowing the late 2022 success of our Terrifier 2 release, which surprised and shocked the film\nindustry by achieving approximately $11 million at the domestic box office via a limited release\non just a $250,000 production budget and a less than $500,000 marketing spend, which all\nresulted largely because of Cineverse's very targeted, fan-based, digital and social media\nmarketing plan, that leveraged our horror assets of screen box Bloody Disgusting, we set out to\nfully employ all the assets that we have built over the past few years to devise a new marketing\nand distribution strategy for Terrifier 3 that would take full advantage of the powerful fan-based\nentertainment ecosystem we now have in place as well as the strength of the film franchise\nitself.\nOur marketing and release planned for Terrifier 2 worked brilliantly with its performance stunning\nin the industry even more than Terrifier 2 did.\nReleased on over 2,500 screens on October 11 amidst many mega dollar production budget\nand mega dollar marketing spend major studio releases, Terrifier 3 opened to number1 at the\ndomestic box office with almost $19 million in ticket sales, supplanting Joker, Folie a Deux to\nbecome the top-performing film in America. The film has now rolled on to record more than $54\nmillion at the domestic box office and is now the number1 performing unrated film of all time,\ntaking over the top spot from the previous record holder Renaissance, a film by Beyonce.\nWe accomplished this by effectively employing every asset in the Cineverse ecosystem to\nmobilize the horror fan base to come out and see the movie in theaters, fully utilizing our\nMatchpoint technology, our streaming channel portfolio with over 80 million monthly viewers, our\nsocial media footprint including Bloody Disgusting and our top 10 podcast network in an\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nincredibly cost-efficient way to build awareness and interest for an audience that then came out\nto see the movie in droves.\nBecause we so effectively employed this ecosystem to identify and mobilize fans to Terrifier 3 in\ntheaters, we spent well under $1 million in out-of-pocket cost to market the movie, a number\nthat has astounded the industry, particularly since we released the film among major studio\nreleases with marketing budgets well north of $20 million to $30 million.\nIn the case of Joker, probably more than $100 million in marketing spend worldwide on top of a\nreported $190 million production budget.\nWe calculate that our ecosystem most likely created over $5 million in media value to support\nour movie that involved no cash outlay on our part.\nI've personally been involved in the release of at least 500 films in my career, both major studio\nreleases and independent filmsand the box office revenue to cash marketing spend ratio for\nTerrifier 3 is exponentially higher than any result I have ever seen. The performance of Terrifier\n3 is truly in a class by itself.\nThe industry has taken note of that in a big way.\nWe believe that the record-setting performance of Terrifier 3 is strong evidence that Cineverse's\necosystem of assets has established a potential new blueprint for releasing films theatrically in a\nmuch smarter, cost-effective and risk-advantaged manner than anything ever attempted in this\nspace before.\nWe believe this can be a major advantage going forward for independent films, filmmakers and\neven for the major studios if the majors choose to rethink their spending plans from the ground\nup. Like Cineverse did, for both of the Terrifier movies.\nOur studio competitors also do not have the powerful and complete combination of targeted\nstreaming channels, passionate fan bases that view our channels more than 80 million times\nper month, wide social media footprints and influencers like Bloody Disgusting, a top 10 podcast\nnetwork and targeted Matchpoint advertising technology that we do.\nWe just resoundingly demonstrated the power of that ecosystem to the rest of the industry by\nfully leveraging our integrated assets to do when almost everyone in the entertainment business\nthought was impossible.\nOpen to number1 and then go on to earn more than $54 million at the box office and still going\nfor less than a $1 million marketing spend. That previously unheard of feat in the movie\nbusiness is creating a lot of interest from independent producers and other studios to try to\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\ngenerate similar theatrical performance results utilizing Cineverse's ecosystem in the same\nmanner as Terrifier 3.\nNot just in horror, but in other genres where we have strong footprints and fan bases like family\nfilms, female-oriented films, animation and anime. This could create an entirely new profit line\nfor us.\nOf course we plan to utilize this successful release blueprint for Cineverse's own releases as\nwell.\nOur recent announcement that we're going to distribute the remake of the controversial or horror\nfilm classic, Silent Night, Deadly Night, for which we have worldwide rights at the end of this\nyear is a testament to that point.\nI also want to emphasize that having two really great movies in Terrifier 2 and 3, that resonated\nstrongly with both critics and audiences alike, had an overriding impact on the success of both\nfilms.\nSo our hats are off to Director/Writer, Damian Leone; Producer, Phil Falcone; and the entire\nTerrifier-creative team for their vision, their understanding of their audience and their creative\ngenius to power these films.\nSo what's next for Terrifier 3? The film will soon be distributed into the digital and DVD Blu-ray\nmarkets in our current fiscal third quarter with a streaming pay TV release following that.\nOur distribution costs for these ancillary markets are extremely small.\nSo we expect a very high margin return and significant profits from these post-theatrical channel\nreleases. Terrifier 2 has also had a strong rebirth in digital sales due to all the activity around the\nrelease of Terrifier 3, underscoring the evergreen power of the terrify franchise yet again.\nAdditionally, we're planning a Christmas reissue of Terrifier 3 in the box office with added\nfeatures to attract the fan base yet again. Like every major independent and major studio, we do\nnot disclose profitability on individual films for competitive reasons and also for participant\nnondisclosure reasons.\nHowever it's obvious that Terrifier3 will be extremely profitable and will have a very significant\npositive impact on our financial results beginning in our next reported quarter.\nFor instance, we more than recovered our total acquisition and marketing investment in the film\nfrom our share of theatrical revenues alone in just the first 48 hours of release, and we expect to\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nbook more than $20 million in theatrical revenues by December 31, which represents our share\nof domestic box office, which we split with theatrical exhibitors.\nOn top of that, we will be recording the very significant high-margin revenues from the ancillary\nmarkets that I just mentioned, plus potential revenues for our screen box streaming channel in\nour fiscal third quarter ending on December 31st, and then in the many quarters beyond that.\nSuffice it to say that this film is probably the highest ROI film I've ever been involved with and\nour investors will begin to see that very soon.\nThe cash impact from this wildly successful release will also provide a significant balance sheet\nupside to Cineverse. It has been our goal to achieve a sustainable self-funding balance sheet\nfor our ongoing operations.\nWe believe Terrifier 3 advances that agenda by miles. And as such, we have no plans to raise\noutside equity capital to support our current operations in the foreseeable future.\nWith that, I'll turn things over to Mark.\nMark Lindsey^ Thank you, Chris.\nAs Chris mentioned, we had an exceptionally strong quarter, allowing us to exceed analysts'\nconsensus guidance for revenue, net income, net income per share and adjusted EBITDA.\nFor our second fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, Cineverse reported total revenues of\n$12.7 million compared to $10.6 million in the prior year period or a 20% increase when\nexcluding the $2.4 million of nonrecurring noncash revenues from our legacy digital Cinema\nbusiness from the prior year quarter.\nIn addition, compared to our last quarter ended June 30, 2024, our revenues increased by $3.6\nmillion or 40%. The 20% increase in recurring revenues in the current quarter was driven by\n$0.7 million increase in streaming and digital revenue, primarily due to a $1.6 million of revenue\nfrom the licensing of our Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan content, a $0.6 million or 93%\nincrease in our podcast and other revenue and a $0.8 million increase in our base distribution\nrevenue.\nWith the amazing performance of Terrifier 3, the continued double-digit growth of our podcast\nbusiness, improved content licensing opportunities and expected growth in our direct advertising\nrevenues we are expecting a material increase in revenue for our fiscal quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2024. Erick will provide additional details on the operational drivers behind our\nfinancial results.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nAs Chris mentioned, our direct operating margin for the quarter was 51%, which exceeded our\npreviously issued guidance of 45% to 50% for direct operating margins.\nOur improved direct operating margin is a direct result of our cost optimization initiatives referred\nto earlier.\nWe expect our direct operating margin in future quarters to be in line with our -- in line with or\nexceed our previously stated targeted margins of 45% to 50%.\nSG&A expenses decreased $0.5 million or 7% for the second quarter compared to the prior\nyear quarter. Again, this improvement is the result of our continued focus on cost optimization\ninitiatives that we've been discussing over the last 1.5 years.\nOver the last six quarters, we've decreased our SG&A expenses from an average of $9.2 million\nper quarter for fiscal year 2023 to $6.4 million this quarter for an annualized savings of $11.4\nmillion.\nFor the remainder of fiscal year 2025, we expect our SG&A expenses to remain relatively flat\nand continue to decline as a percentage of revenue as we continue to focus on our cost savings\ninitiatives and leveraging our offshoring opportunities in Cineverse Services India. Adjusted\nEBITDA for the quarter was $0.5 million compared to a negative $0.1 million for the same\nquarter last year when excluding the $2.4 million of prior year nonrecurring noncash revenues\nfrom our legacy digital Cinema business discussed previously.\nWe had $2.4 million in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet as of September 30,\n2024, and $4.7 million outstanding on our $7.5 million working capital facility with an additional\n$2.7 million of available capacity.\nDuring the quarter, our cash flows used in operations was a negative $0.7 million, of which $0.7\nmillion was related to investments in our content portfolio via advanced and/or minimum\nguaranteed payments. When excluding our content portfolio spend during the quarter, our cash\nflows provided by operations was breakeven.\nWe expect to be operating cash flow positive for the full fiscal year 2025. I also want to remind\neveryone that our Board of Directors approved a 1-year extension of our stock repurchase\nprogram.\nThe program to purchase 500,000 shares now expires on March 1, 2025. During the quarter, we\nrepurchased approximately 31,000 shares under this program, bringing our fiscal year-to-date\nshare repurchases to 215,000 shares.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nAs we discussed last quarter, we believe our stock was significantly undervalued at less than $1\nper share with a market cap that was materially lower than our book value.\nAs of the close of business yesterday our stock price closed at $2.68 per share, reflecting an\napproximate $42 million market cap, which we believe is somewhat more representative of our\ntrue value.\nWe believe that there is still material upside to our stock price based on the phenomenal results\nof Terrifier 3, the significant growth that we are realizing in our podcast and advertising lines of\nbusiness and our technology initiatives, which are just beginning to take hold. With that, I'll turn\nthe floor over to Erick to discuss our strategic growth initiatives. Erick?\nErick Opeka^ Thank you, Mark.\nAs we discussed last quarter, we focused on a few key strategies to drive our growth. This\nincluded expanding our streaming footprint, enhanced ad sales capabilities, opening up new\ndistribution channels and investing in technology that supports everything we do. This quarter,\nwe took solid steps in each area, building a foundation that aligns with our long-term vision.\nNow while today's numbers don't yet capture the impact of Terrifier 3, which has performed far\nbeyond expectations in theaters.\nWe expect to see significant financial contributions from it through all lines of our business in the\nnext quarter, as Chris and Mark will detail.\nWe're excited about what Terrifier 3 represents, and how it reinforces our direction for\nsustainable growth.\nOn the streaming side, total subscribers for the quarter were approximately $1.36 million,\nmarking a 13% increase over the prior year quarter.\nDuring the quarter, anticipation for Terrifier 3 also fueled renewed interest in Terrifier 2 on our\nplatforms. with screen box subscribers growing approximately 7% in September alone.\nThe films viewership surged by 161% from August, reaching 1.28 million minutes viewed across\nall internal platforms in September.\nOn third-party platforms like Amazon, the film has dramatically exceeded all expectations and\nnew revenue-sharing agreements we put in place on the franchise lead to significant low\n7-figure revenue streams on the title in the subsequent quarters from this quarter.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nWe expect these films to be evergreen cash cows for the company for the foreseeable future.\nOur FASTs channel also saw remarkable growth this quarter with more than 2.32 billion minutes\nstreamed during the quarter up 40% over the prior year quarter.\nSeptember marked the second best month ever for our Dove Channel with over 95 million\nminutes consumed just behind July and up over August, typically a slow month of the year for\nFAST.\nOur Barney channel that was recently launched this year, continues to perform exceptionally,\nreaching an all-time high in September of over 129 million minutes viewed, marking seven\nconsecutive months of growth. Even our reality-focused channel So Real, also hit record\nmonthly highs and with programming changes, we see it on an outstanding trajectory to join our\ntop-performing channels.\nOur podcast network has also become a critical piece of our revenue engagement strategy with\nongoing rapid growth.\nSince last quarter, we've expanded to 51 podcasts, adding high-profile shows that continue to\nbroaden our audience reach.\nWe're thrilled to have signed the Dead Meat podcast hosted by Chelsea Rebecca and James A.\nJanisse from the Dead Meat YouTube channel with more than 6.6 million subscribers.\nWe're also integrating podcast into our broader Cineverse brands such as Retro Crush hosted\nby TikTok personality, Malcolm Crawford, and Midnight Pulp in preproduction with Diana Prince\nknown for the Last Drive-In on Shudder.\nOur true crime show, Creepy Places, hosted by John Grilz of Creepy, which attracts 1.3 million\nmonthly downloads is another standout.\nOur original podcast Mayfair Watcher’s Society has also returned for its second season after\nbeing named of Apple's top podcasts and ranking in the top 5% of most shared podcasts on\nSpotify.\nOctober was a record month with our podcast network reaching 15 million downloads and\nlistens, placing us among the top 10 largest podcast network globally.\nWith this momentum, we're well positioned to achieve 8-figure annual revenues in the midterm.\nAd sales also performed well with booked revenue up over 60% over Q1 and underscoring our\nsuccessful focus on direct ad sales and premium pricing.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nWe're pleased to report that we're attracting major blue-chip clients including Paramount,\nLionsgate, Disney, 20th Century Fox, FX Networks, Sony Pictures and Activision. Those were\nall customers during the quarter. This quarter also marked the first time we received requests for\nproposals from non-entertainment brands including Macy's, Wendy's, McDonald's, Grubhub,\nFrito Lay and Pepsi.\nThis expansion into consumer brands broadens our revenue base and strengthens our position\nas a go-to platform for high-value brand partnerships. Driving the success is the growth of our\nC360 platform, which processed over 20 billion ad requests in October. This technology is\nallowing us to help our advertisers reach highly targeted audiences efficiently delivering\nhigh-value results for our clients. Turning to Matchpoint\n, we continue to see strong progress.\nWe've recently made several key hires to support growing demand and now low-to-mid 7-figure\npipeline of opportunities including OEMs, new and existing channel platforms, content\ndistributors and more.\nWe've closed some initial deals that showcase Matchpoint's potential, and these deals represent\nsubstantial infrastructure investments for our customers. Typically, the lead time on deals to\nMatchpoint is about a 6- to 12-month lead time so\nwe anticipate seeing the real financial impact in the back half of this year and into the new fiscal\nyear beginning in April.\nAdditionally, we're developing shorter-cycle revenue opportunities through our Dispatch\nbusiness, helping clients scale to meet the demands of FAST AVOD and AI licensing markets.\nWe're actively engaged in meaningful conversations that could lead to significant new business\non this front.\nOn the technology side, cineSearch, our AI-powered content discovery tool developed with\nGoogle is on track for a full consumer release next year. We're already in discussions with\nseveral major OEMs to license in a cineSearch, which opens up a promising new revenue\nstream if we're successful.\nWe're also seeing opportunities to license portions of our content library for AI training. We're in\ndiscussions with multiple parties to add significant volume and value to our 66,000 title library\npositioning Cineverse as a leader in AI-driven content licensing.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nLooking ahead, we're doubling down on scaling SVOD, AVOD and FAST channels with tech\npartnerships, expanding our content licensing, building on direct ad sales and driving revenue\nthrough Matchpoint and podcasts.\nWe're also developing a strong IP and franchise-driven theatrical slate, that complements\nTerrifier, which has already redefined what's possible in indie horror. Above all, Cineverse\nstands out for our highly supportive model for filmmakers with fair transparent deals and\ndata-driven money ball approach to content powered by proprietary technology. This is a\ngroundbreaking model not currently available from any major or mini-major studio.\nAnd this approach leverages our ecosystem to provide a cost-effective, risk-advantaged\npathway to success. The strategies we outlined last quarter are producing real results as shown\nwith the financial results this quarter and our growth in stream engagement, ad sales, podcast\nlistenership and tech innovation positions us for sustained profitability and growth.\nWe look forward to building on this momentum and showing what a modern tech-enabled\nentertainment company can achieve. With that, Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.\nOperator^ (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Dan Kurnos with\nBenchmark Company.\nDaniel Kurnos^ Chris, obviously just a big congratulations on what is an unprecedented\nsuccess in the movie industry.\nI'm sure you've been getting plenty of plaudits from your peers and others, but I'll just start off by\nsaying that on T3.\nI -- you mentioned it in your prepared remarks.\nI'd love to have a sense from you guys you're going to make a boatload of cash from this thing.\nYou have some debt, you can kind of fund additional investments in content based on that\nplaybook.\nHow do we think about how you're going to position the company going forward?\nI know you're going to talk more about it next quarter, but you started with silent, but just help us\nthink through what the success means and what other films could do like how does this grow\nquickly into another revenue stream for you?\nChris McGurk^ Yes.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nThank you, Dan, for those comments. It was very nice of you. Well look, we're still a streaming\ntechnology and content company. That's the core of what we do.\nAnd I think you saw the results this quarter, where our revenues were up 40% over the last\nsequential quarter show that our plan is working across our base business even without Terrifier.\nIn terms of digital licensing your technology business, broadcast business, our streaming\nbusiness on, so I just want to underscore that point.\nOur goal right now is to really take advantage of what just happened, where we sort of\ndeveloped a new blueprint for releasing movies that kind of astounded in the industry and turn it\ninto another successful profit line for the company and it's consistent with who we are because\nthe reason why the release works so well is what I was saying in my remarks and Erick did also,\nthat we leveraged every element in this ecosystem that we built over the last 10 years in order\nto build a better mousetrap and figure out how to release a movie in an incredibly successful\nway with almost no out-of-pocket marketing spend. It's just kind of astounding that we did that.\nSo the goal now is to leverage our entire ecosystem, create a new line of business here, both\nwith product that we acquire ourselves and then to allow other independent studios and actually\nmajors to use our ecosystem to market and leverage their own product because they don't have\nall the assets that we have in place across this really fan-centric portfolio of channels, our\npodcast network, our ad technology, always during our social footprint with Bloody Disgusting.\nSo we're sorting through properties right now.\nObviously people are knocking on our door, particularly in the horror space. You saw that we\njust announced Silent Night, Deadly Night, which is a classic controversial horror movie that\ncame out in '84 and banned from theaters.\nWe're continuing our assault on Christmas following Terrifier 3 with Art the Clown as Santa\nClaus.\nBut we've got a number of other properties that we're looking at some very well-known IP that\npeople want us to consider taking out using our ecosystem.\nAnd we've had some entries in the non horror space as well in the faith and family space and in\nthe animation space.\nSo it's our goal really to turn this into an ongoing business.\nIt's not going to be a hugely capital-intensive business for us as we just saw with Terrifier 3.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nIt really is an extension and supports and augments, and it's based on all of the assets we put in\nplace as a technology and streaming company.\nSo I think you're going to see more announcements about content releases coming over the\nnext three or four months.\nSome of those might be releases that happen sooner rather than later.\nDaniel Kurnos^ Got it. That's hugely helpful. And just one last one on T3 before I turn ton Erick,\nhow are we thinking about -- at this point, you have the rerelease in Christmas, but you have an\nopportunity to decide how to maximize the licensing, windowing putting it on ScreamBox.\nHave you thought through that yet?\nAnd do you have a plan, or is that sort of TBD?\nChris McGurk^ That's a great question because, obviously we have to balance. The upside we\nwould get from our subscriber base on ScreamBox versus getting a big check from pay and\nstreaming services that now are recognizing the value of the franchise.\nSo we're actively engaged in analyzing our options in that space, and we hope to make a\ndecision on what we're going to do over the next few weeks.\nDaniel Kurnos^ Perfect. Erick, just quickly for you. I appreciate the update on the direct ads,\nnice progress there.\nI just wanted to ask you quickly about cineSearch and how we should think about that from kind\nof a long-term monetization opportunity given that we're hearing a lot of movement now in the\nindustry around meta tagging kind of what to watch and buy tech.\nI thought your comments on short cycle sales was particularly interesting given that the industry\nhas finally realized that they need to license more content to stem the streaming bleeding.\nSo AVOD and FAST are taking off again. Just kind of curious what you need to see there in\norder to develop that business line.\nErick Opeka^ Sure, sure.\nSo I'll first all tackle the second part of your question on the short cycle piece.\nSo if you kind of look out at the marketplace, there's -- one of the biggest trends has been all of\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nthese FAST platforms, which is basically every single TV OEM manufacturer, the Samsungs,\nVIZIOs and so on of the universe.\nAll of them are really expanding their ad-supported offerings to complement the FAST platforms.\nMost of them launched as FAST-only without much on-demand programming, really to have a\nrounded out offering everybody needs to have a mix of FAST channels, on-demand\nprogramming and add-on subscriptions.\nSo all of them are adding all of these components. What that's caused in the market is a pretty\nsignificant demand for large volumes of ad-supported content.\nSo number one, in addition to us controlling and owning a very large library. Clearly, we're\nrapidly expanding our efforts to distribute AVOD content ourselves.\nBut for Matchpoint, the real opportunity is for most players like us in the industry, the cost of\nrapidly delivering and scaling up content to all of these places quickly, a Berlin airlift of content, if\nyou will, is very, very expensive and has very long cycle time.\nToday we can take a dispatch one of the modules that we have in Matchpoint and help\ncompanies very rapidly either ingest that into their own ecosystem, so we can help platforms do\na better job at it, or we can actually help companies that normally are trying to do this with three\nguys in a room, or you're using expensive outsourced services, scale up and actually make a lot\nof money rapidly to take advantage of that.\nBeyond that, this same system that works incredibly well to help the existing streaming\necosystem is really also a very ideal platform to scale up for an even bigger and more voracious\ncontent demand, and that is AI content licensing. There's been various reports that have said\nthat that can be anywhere from a $1 billion to $5 billion business over the next few years\ndepending on how you look at it.\nBut one thing is certain, the demand out there is real.\nWe're engaged in those conversations today with a variety of partners.\nTwo, the technical challenges with doing it are intense. These platforms that want training data,\nwant to do it in a very rapid period of time. And unless you have a scalable platform like\nMatchpoint, you really can't tackle that problem.\nSo that's really the short-term to midterm opportunity. Both of these are not opportunities that\nare going away but the demand for both of these is very high right now and we have the\ntechnology to help the market actually cash in on it.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nSo that's to that piece.\nThen as we talk about at cineSearch, I think the biggest thing to point out is, if you look at the\nTV OEM space, much like in mobile phones, every major television manufacturer really needs to\nincorporate AI features into their systems for content discovery.\nSome of the larger players may build or develop their own platforms.\nBut when you have more than half of the market out there every television sold with no internal\nsolution to this we think that represents a very large opportunity given just in the U.S. alone,\nthere's something like 40 million plus TV sold every year in the U.S. and double that number\ninternationally.\nSo I think the big thing to think about is us fulfilling a pretty big market need for AI-driven\ncustomer experience tools.\nSo what we're working on now is, as you can imagine, this isn't a turnkey solution for every\nmanufacturer, every manufacturer has different demands. They have different partnerships with\ndifferent players.\nSo it's less of a turnkey white label thing and more of a bespoke approach with these partners.\nSo we're actively engaging in a variety of conversations on that front. I think we really hope to\nhave more on that next year as that evolves.\nOperator^ The next question is from the line of Brian Kinstlinger with Alliance Global Partners.\nBrian Kinstlinger^ Let me add my congrats on your success in the box office.\nFollowing up on the future playbook in response to the success of leveraging your ecosystem\nhow will you go about evaluating what I suspect is numerous independent movies and titles\ncoming to you to determine what the best chance of success under your platform?\nChris McGurk^ Thanks, Brian, for your comment and a couple of things.\nWe have a very exhaustive greenlighting process in place anyways that we would continue to\nuse to evaluate any new property.\nBut first and foremost, we would look for properties that we think we can best leverage with our\nsystem.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nObviously we have a ton of horror assets in place with screen box and Bloody Disgusting in our\nhistory of distributing horror movies and an executive team that really knows what works and\nwhat doesn't work in that space, and that's what we leverage with Terrifier.\nSo we're looking at properties in the horror space, specifically that we can follow the same\nplaybook, properties that have online buzz like Terrifier did, known IP like Silent Night, Deadly\nNight that still has a fan base that will give us a leg up in launching it.\nAnd I think the other thing that's usually important here is kind of a threshold question for any\nmovie in my mind, is - is it a concept or an idea that the fan base is actually going to go to a\ntheater to see.\nWhat is it about the concept that is going to make that fan rush out on that first Friday to go see\nit, so that he can -- he or she can tell all their friends to be the first one to see it.\nThat's sort of a threshold question we asked about any piece of content.\nSo again as I said, we're looking in other verticals where we think we have strength, children's\nand family content.\nWe've really built up that business not just with Dove but with all of the kind of evergreen IP that\nwe're are on our channels now from Garfield to Barney to Sid and Marty Kroft, even Bob Ross\nand Dog Whisperer which we think is very family friendly and very children friendly to anime and\nanimation, which we've had a track record in releasing as well and more pure family and\nfaith-oriented content.\nSo again just to step back again we're looking for properties that clearly, we know we have\nassets, we have expertise and capability and which will give us a leg up in marketing the\nproperty and properties that we know -- we believe there's going to be a call in the fan base to\ngo out and see the theater as opposed to waiting to see it at home.\nAnd we're going to be extremely cautious in terms of our financial commitment to any movie that\nwe put on board, we proved the concept here that we could release a movie and open it to\nnumber one with $500,000 of cash out-of-pocket spending. And all-in investment in the piece of\ncontent and less than $5 million.\nI think that's a good model going forward from a financial standpoint as well.\nSo we feel really good about our positioning.\nWe feel great about the industry response to what we did. People are absolutely astounded by\nit.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nWe feel great about the content submissions that we've seen so far, and you can expect some\nmore announcements about movies, I think in the next two to three months.\nBrian Kinstlinger^ Great.\nThen for titles like Silent Night, Deadly Night or any other title, how will you determine if it will be\na theatrical or a limited release?\nIs that title by title, or are you realizing given your ecosystem you can wide release?\nChris McGurk^ We're intending to use this model to do wide release movies, but until you\nactually see the movie, whether it's in production or you're buying a finished movie, it's tough to\nmake that call. How wide you're going to go.\nFortunately, as I said, with Terrifier 3, we knew what we had.\nWe saw the movie.\nOnce it debuted a Fantastic Fest in Austin in August, we\nknew we had a complete winner based on the critical reaction and also the fan reaction.\nSo there's absolutely no question about going wide with the movie.\nIt was just a matter of getting exhibitors to realize how much upside there was.\nThey quickly figured that out when their theater started selling out five weeks in advance of the\nrelease of the movie.\nSo hopefully, we're going to pick properties that you don't have that level of interest and\nexcitement, but even at a fraction that have sort of that built-in audience and excitement so that\nwe can make a really smart informed decision about whether we go wide on how many theaters\nor whether we take a limited release.\nBrian Kinstlinger^ Great.\nOn cineSearch, maybe you could share a little bit about the revenue model.\nIs this an annual licensing model?\nIs it a recurring kind of SaaS model?\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nIs it price per device if it's on TV?\nJust if you could help us understand how that's going to be monetized to revenue model?\nChris McGurk^ Erick or Tony, you want to take that?\nErick Opeka^ Yes.\nI think at a very high level, and obviously as I mentioned earlier, these are these are really going\nto be more bespoke than a pure SaaS model just due to the size and scale of these types of\ndeals.\nSo -- but I would anticipate the deal being some combination of license fee plus variable costs\nsimilar that you would see in other similar sort of API-driven platform models, right?\nBut I do think also there are other opportunities and ways to do this.\nFor example, advertising-based models and other things that could modify that approach\ndepending on the partner.\nBrian Kinstlinger^ Great. My last question is revenue from podcasting grew 30% sequentially.\nI'm wondering with the various non-entertainment advertisers, you discussed that are coming to\nyou with RFPs with the much stronger viewership, I'm wondering do you expect to see even\nstronger yields where revenue will grow faster than viewership over the next couple of quarters?\nI'm just wondering how you're thinking about that in fill rates.\nErick Opeka^ Yes. Yes.\nSo we -- I think our first goal was to build -- when you're in the chicken and egg scenario of\nbuilding a new product, our first goal was just to build audience with a great lineup of products.\nSo we really did that first before focusing on monetization.\nSo that leads to a natural monetization gap, where you have a lot of head space to grow\nrevenue.\nSo I think you're right, your comment that revenue growth will outpace audience growth.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nAlthough if you look at what I call -- what we can call the Terrifier effect, right, of success begets\nin the film business, obviously success begets more interest.\nIn -- even in the podcast space, the success of Terrifier is opening doors to much larger\nproperties in agencies that represent larger podcast properties that want to join our network.\nSo while I'll say I think in the short term, the audience -- the revenue growth will outpace the\naudience growth. That can also change very quickly if there's some very, very large shows that\nwe've been in dialogue with that want to join the network as well.\nSo in the short term, that's the case.\nBut I think in the longer term, they'll either pace, neck and neck or the -- we may have big\nsurges of audience and inventory growth if we do sign some bigger shows.\nSo our real focus fill is to maximize fill on this platform.\nWe're rapidly hiring up salespeople to help sell that faster.\nWe've been doing co-selling partnerships with a variety of people to help fill the inventory in the\nshort term.\nSo I think our number one goal, this is our biggest real opportunity of scaling revenue growth in\nthe short term outside of the film business is the podcast business.\nSo we're going to put a lot of energy and effort into growing that over the next few quarters.\nOperator^ The next question is from the line of Jay Petschek,with Corsair Capital.\nJay Petschek ^ Great quarter. We've seen it. We're celebrating it.\nI think the promotion of Terrifier not only has highlighted what you can do in the film business,\nbut is raised, obviously Cineverse's capabilities all along.\nI will get to a question, but away from Terrifier which was great. Revenue is up, margins up,\noperating costs down. That seems like a pretty good combination.\nWe're getting close to breakeven.\nWe're still at amazingly, to me, only a $45 million market cap, about a $50 million enterprise\nvalue.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nI think one reason why is because people were worried that you'd run out of cash and have to\ndo a dilutive financing as was done maybe a year ago and glad to hear you emphasize that\nyou're not going to need cash.\nI mean this Terrifier is a real boon.\nI guess there'll be another real chance of it from Terrifier 4 as well in a couple of years.\nIn any case, there's a lot of statement. My question, because I think the other two gentlemen\nasked good questions about the opportunity space. The data AI business, you know I'm a little\nbit in thrall with that idea, the amount of spending that's going on right now to improve AI is\namazing.\nBut what sets you apart, why you're not the biggest company out there. You have a big library\nYes.\nBut compared to the Disney and Warner Bros. and Universal, why wouldn't the data AI guys get\ntheir data from video from those folks.\nI think I think I know the answer, but I'd like to hear it again and probably helpful to others.\nChris McGurk^ That's a good question, Jay.\nI'll let Erick answer that more specifically in a second, but it has to do with our technological\ncapabilities and our capability over the years that we've demonstrated in acquiring, assimilating\nand distributing vast amounts of content across the spectrum, and we've probably done more of\nthat than anybody in the business.\nBut I just -- I want to thank you for your support and your question, and we really appreciate it.\nI just want to say that at the onset.\nThen I'll turn it over to Erick and let Erick specifically answer the question on AI data capability.\nErick?\nErick Opeka^ Sure, sure.\nWell I think if you look at the AI licensing landscape, there's a couple of challenges that you've\nseen deals announced with AI being used at studios.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nBut really, it's been more of -- to develop internal tools for marketing. What we haven't really\nseen is a major licensing deal out.\nThere's a couple of reasons for that.\nOne is I think the issue with guilds and unions and talent in the -- at the top echelon of the space\nas well as IP rights and other things for some of these multibillion-dollar franchises that make it\nincredibly difficult for the studios to do licensing they’re signatories to all kinds of agreements\nand other things.\nIn the independent space and more broadly in the global space, there isn't those same\nlimitations. When you think about these AI training models, they actually want a high degree of\ndiversity. They want high-quality content. They want independent content, they want\ndocumentaries.\nThey want foreign films, they want foreign TV shows.\nSo it actually -- they do not want to blanket and only license studio content because that will\nskew the models in one direction.\nSo I think the dynamics of what they need, which is this diverse set of information and data\nmakes this market highly beneficial for independents. The second piece, why us versus anyone\nelse is very simple that the idea of scale.\nWe've been in the business of delivering massive amounts of scale content into the streaming\necosystem.\nWe've delivered literally millions of assets out into the streaming ecosystem over the last 15\nyears.\nWe now have an automation platform that allows us to not only deliver this at scale, but do the\npreprocessing or work that's required to meet the very specific and very intensive needs of AI\nmodels that if any one of these studios or companies that have a big library try to do this today\nthe high cost of using third-party traditional services or trying to do it internally is cost prohibitive\nand at the pricing levels for licensing today eats up anywhere from 60% to 80% of the revenue\ngenerated.\nSo it's just not a sustainable model unless you have a big scale system.\nSo that's where dispatch really comes in.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nIf we ingest this content and literally, we can scale up and deliver for an infinitesimally small\nfraction of what it would cost somebody to do it through one of these more expensive systems.\nSo our leadership in the space that we've been doing this for 15 years.\nWe were an Apple aggregator, help them build iTunes up and helped all the others do it.\nOur diverse library that actually fits what these guys want.\nThen lastly, a scalable platform designed to do exactly what the AI environment wants. Those\nthree factors together make us probably the most qualified company in the space to help\nsupport that growth.\nSo that's -- I hope that answers your question.\nJay Petschek ^ It does.\nI think it's obviously a very big opportunity given the size of your firm today to license out a few\nmillion dollars a year is huge to you at this time. Just following up on that, as you talked about\nyour ability to get it in the right whatever metadata form or whatever you call it, for AI ingestion\nor analysis.\nBut to license out your library today do you have to spend any significant sums to get your\nlibrary in shape, or you've already done that?\nErick Opeka^ I'll let Tony Huidor. Tony Huidor on the call. Go ahead, Tony.\nTony Huidor^ I'll take that question.\nSo the underlying sort of premise of Matchpoint is we do a deal with the licensor and they\ndeliver our highest quality source.\nTo Matchpoint, then it then on the goes QC and mastering and prep.\nWe then take that file and it sits inside of Matchpoint. And from that point on, they never need to\ndeliver the file again and Matchpoint can deliver 1,000 different ways.\nSo regardless of what any of these AI partners requirements are Matchpoint was designed to\ndeliver to that spec.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nSo to Erick's point, we can -- these companies are -- when they're licensing video for data,\nthey're not licensing 50 movies or 100, they're -- each order is on the average of 10,000 hours\nor more in the tens of thousands of hours.\nSo this is why, to Erick's point, this won't scale for the big studios because they're using\nthird-party vendors we're generally charging $500 to $1,500 per file delivery.\nOf the revenue to license a title for training is far less than that it's just not sustainable. Whereas\nfor Matchpoint, our cost to actually use Matchpoint and deliver is measured significantly less\nthan that.\nAnd so we could deliver 10,000 movies at a click of a button without a single human touching a\nsingle file.\nIn any flavor that any partner wants.\nThat is our secret sauce, and that is the competitive advantage that we have with Matchpoint\nwhere we can use that to deliver our own library and potentially even deliver on behalf of other\ncompanies who are looking to license to the AI companies.\nJay Petschek^ Great, thank you.\nUm, well, I look forward to, uh, continuing improvement in the core line, the, uh, new line of\nbusiness promoting movies sort of individually on top of the Terrifier franchise and all the\nmetaverse, meta search, et cetera, et cetera, so thank you and congrats on Terrifier again.\nChris McGurk^ Thank you, Jay.\nThank you, Jay. That, that, that is the plan and thank you.\nOperator^ There are no further questions remaining.\nSo I'll pass the conference back over to the management team for closing remarks.\nChris McGurk^ Yes. This is Chris.\nSo thanks all of you for joining us today.\nIf you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out the Julie Milstead with any\nadditional questions you might have.\nCineverse Corp.\nFiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call\nI hope you all go to see the Christmas reissue the Terrifier 3, and then we look forward to\nspeaking to you all again on our next quarterly call. Thank you very much.\nOperator^ That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may\nnow disconnect your lines."
