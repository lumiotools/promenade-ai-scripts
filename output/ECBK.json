Business\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “project,”\n“believe,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “plan,” “seek,” “expect,” “will,” “may,” “should,” “indicate,” “would,” “believe,” “contemplate,”\n“continue,” “target” and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:\n• statements of our goals, intentions and expectations;\n• statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies;\n• statements regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and\n• estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business,\neconomic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements\nare subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. We are under no duty to and do not\ntake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report.\nThe following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations\nexpressed in the forward-looking statements:\n• general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected including as a result of\nemployment levels and labor shortages, and the effects of inflation, a potential recession or slowed economic growth caused by\nsupply chain disruptions or otherwise;\n• the extent, severity or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on us and on our customers, employees and third-party service providers;\n• changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for\nloan losses;\n• our ability to access cost-effective funding;\n• fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions;\n• demand for loans and deposits in our market area;\n• our ability to implement and change our business strategies;\n• competition among depository and other financial institutions;\n• inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, our mortgage banking revenues, the fair\nvalue of financial instruments, or our level of loan originations, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments on loans we\nhave made and make;\n• adverse changes in the securities or secondary mortgage markets;\n• changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees, capital\nrequirements and insurance premiums;\n• changes in the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios;\n• technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected;\n• the inability of third-party providers to perform as expected;\n1\n• a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, including cyberattacks;\n• our ability to manage market risk, credit risk and operational risk;\n• our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities;\n• changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;\n• changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n• our ability to attract and retain key employees; and\n• changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own.\nBecause of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by\nthese forward-looking statements.\nIn this Annual Report the terms “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to ECB Bancorp, Inc. and Everett Co-operative Bank, unless the context\nindicates another meaning. In addition, we sometimes refer to ECB Bancorp, Inc. as “ECB Bancorp,” and to Everett Co-operative Bank as the\n“Bank.”\n2\nBUSINESS OF ECB BANCORP, INC.\nECB Bancorp, Inc. (sometimes herein, the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation that was incorporated in March 2022 for the purpose of\nbecoming the registered bank holding company for Everett Co-operative Bank (the “Bank”) upon the consummation of the Bank’s mutual to stock\nconversion and initial stock offering which was completed on July 27, 2022. In connection with the conversion, the Company sold 8,915,247\nshares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, which included 734,020 shares sold to the Bank’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan, for gross\noffering proceeds (before deducting offering expenses) of approximately $89.2 million based on the offering price of $10.00 per share. The\nCompany also contributed 260,000 shares of common stock and $600,000 in cash to the Everett Co-operative Bank Charitable Foundation, Inc.\nThe shares of the Company’s common stock sold in the offering began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on July 28, 2022 under the symbol\n“ECBK.”\nSince being incorporated, other than holding the common stock of Everett Co-operative Bank, retaining approximately 31% of the net cash\nproceeds of the stock conversion offering and making a loan to the Bank’s employee stock ownership plan, we have not engaged in any material\nbusiness activities to date.\nOur cash flow depends on earnings from the investment of the net proceeds we retained from our initial public stock offering that was\nconsummated in July 2022, and any dividends we receive from Everett Co-operative Bank. We neither own nor lease any property, but pay a fee\nto Everett Co-operative Bank for the use of its premises, equipment and furniture. At the present time, we employ only persons who are officers of\nEverett Co-operative Bank who also serve as officers of ECB Bancorp. We use the support staff of Everett Co-operative Bank from time to time\nand pay a fee to Everett Co-operative Bank for the time devoted to ECB Bancorp by employees of Everett Co-operative Bank. However, these\npersons are not separately compensated by ECB Bancorp. ECB Bancorp may hire additional employees, as appropriate, to the extent it expands its\nbusiness in the future.\nOur executive offices are located at 419 Broadway, Everett, Massachusetts 02149. Our telephone number at this address is (617) 387-1110.\nOur website address is www.everettbank.com. Information on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should\nnot be considered part of this Annual Report.\n3\nBUSINESS OF EVERETT CO-OPERATIVE BANK\nGeneral\nEverett Co-operative Bank is a Massachusetts-chartered stock cooperative bank headquartered in Everett, Massachusetts. The Bank\ncompleted its mutual to stock conversion on July 27, 2022 at which time it became the wholly owned subsidiary of ECB Bancorp.\nEverett Co-operative Bank was organized in 1890 and has operated continuously in Everett, Massachusetts since this time. We conduct\nbusiness from our two full-service banking offices located in Everett, Massachusetts and Lynnfield, Massachusetts which are located in the greater\nBoston metropolitan area in Middlesex and Essex Counties. Everett is adjacent to Boston and is approximately three miles from Boston’s\nfinancial district, and Lynnfield is located approximately 10 miles to the north in Essex County. We consider our deposit market area to be\nMiddlesex, Essex and Suffolk Counties, Massachusetts and our primary lending area to be these Counties as well as Norfolk County,\nMassachusetts, which are located primarily within the Route 128 corridor outside of Boston.\nOur business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from\noperations, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate and multifamily real estate loans, construction and land loans\nand home equity lines of credit. At December 31, 2022, $355.4 million, or 39.8%, of our total loan portfolio was comprised of one- to four-family\nresidential real estate loans, $242.0 million, or 27.1%, of our total loan portfolio was comprised of multifamily real estate loans, $156.2 million, or\n17.5%, of our total loan portfolio was comprised of commercial real estate loans, $107.3 million, or 12.0%, of our total loan portfolio was\ncomprised of construction loans, and $27.8 million, or 3.1%, of our total loan portfolio was comprised of home equity lines of credit and loans.\nWe also invest in securities, consisting primarily of U.S. government and federal agency obligations, mortgage-backed securities and corporate\nbonds. We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including certificate of deposit accounts, IRAs, money market accounts, savings accounts, demand\ndeposit accounts and interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing checking accounts. We historically have utilized advances from the Federal Home\nLoan Bank of Boston (the “FHLB”) to fund our operations and we had $174.0 million of FHLB advances at December 31, 2022. Additionally, in\nrecent years, we have also accepted brokered deposits as a non-retail funding source to fund our operations. At December 31, 2022, we had $100.8\nmillion of brokered deposits outstanding.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had net income of $2.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively. Our 2022 net income\nwas affected by an after-tax charge of $2.3 million related to a contribution to the Everett Co-operative Bank Charitable Foundation as part of our\nmutual to stock conversion and 2021 net income was affected by an after-tax charge of $1.4 million related to our freezing of and withdrawal from\na defined benefit plan.\nEnhanced Management Team and Modified Business Strategy\nIn recent years, we have focused on building an experienced management team and revising our operating and business strategy. In 2016\nwe hired our Chief Executive Officer, Richard O’Neil, who, prior to his hiring, had served as outside general counsel and has been a board\nmember of Everett Co-operative Bank since 1997. In 2019, we hired John Citrano, our Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and\nChief Financial Officer. Mr. Citrano has 34 years of experience in the financial services industry including his role as Chief Financial Officer of a\npublicly traded community bank in the greater Boston area.\nUnder Messrs. O’Neil’s and Citrano’s leadership, we conducted an extensive review of our loan operations, retail and branch marketing and\ninformation technology strategies, and, with the recent hiring of several seasoned bankers and operations staff, we have enhanced and expanded\nour operations and increased our focus on our commercial real estate lending and our commercial banking relationships. We have also focused on\nimproving our services and delivery channels, including our digital delivery channels and services for our commercial customers.\nOne of the key features of our recently modified business strategy is to grow our loan portfolio, primarily through an increased focus on\ngrowing our commercial real estate and multifamily lending operations. In order to further enhance our commercial real estate and multifamily\nlending infrastructure and continue to grow our portfolio, in January 2022, we hired a new Chief Lending Officer, John Migliozzi, who has over\n35 years of lending experience in the greater Boston\n4\nmetropolitan area. We also hired additional experienced lending and credit analyst personnel throughout 2022. Consistent with our strategy to\ngrow our commercial loan operations and the consequent commercial relationship opportunities that may be presented by our increased activity in\nthe commercial real estate market, we are in the process of upgrading our suite of deposit products and related services and are upgrading our\ndigital and mobile applications in order to accommodate business customers and thereby accelerate the growth in our core deposits.\nHistorically, given our size, capital position and lending team experience and capacity, we have originated for participation to other local\nbanking institutions our larger commercial real estate and commercial loans. As we continue to enhance our commercial real estate team and\ninfrastructure and with the increase in capital resulting from the conversion, we are able to selectively retain larger loans that we historically\nwould have originated for participation with other local institutions. In this regard, we have revised our lending policies and loans to one borrower\nlimitations to increase our lending limits and the type and size of loans we choose to hold in our portfolio.\nWe are similarly focused on enhancing our retail operations. In November 2021 we hired Cary Lynch as our new Senior Vice President of\nRetail Operations. Mr. Lynch has 36 years of community banking experience, including 31 years in the greater Boston metropolitan area, and he is\noverseeing our efforts to ensure that our products, services and accessibility will continue to make Everett Co-operative Bank a competitive\ncommunity bank, and will continue to attract and retain retail customers by emphasizing personal service, accessibility and flexibility in the face\nof mass market-oriented large, national and super-regional banks which maintain local branch networks in our market. Some of the programs and\nefforts we are pursuing in these areas include: introducing a new mobile and on-line bank interface; offering branded consumer credit and\nbusiness credit cards; offering merchant services programs to enhance the small business customer experience at Everett Co-operative Bank; and\nproviding new on-line account operations to enhance and facilitate new customer acquisitions.\nFinally, in recognition of our expected growth through the above-mentioned efforts and in becoming a public company with the attendant\naccounting and financial reporting obligations, in 2021 we hired a Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer who has 18 years of public\ncompany accounting and community banking experience, including having served in a chief accounting role at a publicly traded community bank\nin the greater Boston metropolitan area.\nThese efforts, and especially the hiring of the executive officers, have and will continue to increase non-interest expense, including our\ncompensation and benefits expense and technology and operational expenses, which affected our net income in 2022, but we believe our recent\nhires and operational measures will create the framework for us to execute on our strategy to grow the Bank through orderly and diligent loan\ngrowth, including competing for and underwriting larger individual loans and maintaining larger lending relationships. Similarly, we believe that\nwe are well-positioned to execute on our retail growth strategy including our increased emphasis on retail sales marketing efforts by Bank\npersonnel, the implementation of opening accounts online and enhanced mobile and electronic banking products and services. We have and expect\nto continue to invest in our personnel and information technology and as needed, we will add additional business development personnel, all of\nwhich will increase our overall expenses.\nWe believe we have been effective in competing against both larger regional banks and local community banks operating in our market. We\ncompete against the larger banks through our responsive and personalized service, providing our customers with quicker decision making,\ncustomized products where appropriate and access to our senior managers. We believe our highly experienced commercial and residential bankers\nand a sophisticated product and service mix, including a suite of technology solutions and support, enable us to compete effectively against local\ncommunity banks. We believe that recent consolidation of financial institutions in and around our market continues to create further opportunity\nfor expansion in our market and hiring available personnel. We will continue to emphasize these core business principles as we focus on growing\nour balance sheet and will implement them with the larger banking relationships that we seek to originate and maintain.\nReflecting our focus on our community, in connection with our mutual to stock conversion and initial public offering which closed in July\n2022, we established a charitable foundation called Everett Co-operative Bank Charitable Foundation and funded it with $600,000 in cash and\n260,000 shares of our common stock, for a total contribution of $3,200,000 based on the $10.00 per share offering price. The purpose of this\nfoundation is to make contributions to support various charitable organizations operating in our community now and in the future.\n5\nEverett Co-operative Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Massachusetts Commission of Banks\n(\"Commissioner\"), as its chartering agency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as its primary federal regulator and primary\ninsurer of its deposits. See “Supervision and Regulation.” Our executive offices are located at 419 Broadway, Everett, Massachusetts 02149. Our\ntelephone number at this address is (617) 387-1110. Our website address is www.everettbank.com. Information on our website is not\nincorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this Annual Report.\nMarket Area\nWe consider Middlesex, Essex and Suffolk Counties, Massachusetts as our primary market area for gathering deposits, and each of these\nCounties as well as Norfolk County, Massachusetts as our primary lending market area. Our main office and one additional branch office are\nlocated in Middlesex and Essex Counties, respectively, both of which are located in the greater Boston metropolitan area. Everett is a suburb\nwhich is adjacent to Boston and approximately three miles from Boston’s financial district, and Lynnfield where our additional branch office is\nlocated is approximately 10 miles north in Essex County. While we occasionally make loans secured by properties located outside of our primary\nlending market, these loans are generally to borrowers with whom we have an existing relationship and who have a presence within our primary\nlending market.\nThe Boston metropolitan area benefits from the presence of numerous institutions of higher learning, medical care and research centers and\nthe corporate headquarters of several significant multinational corporations. Eastern Massachusetts also has many high technology companies\nemploying personnel with specialized skills. These factors affect the demand for residential homes, multifamily apartments, office buildings,\nshopping centers, industrial warehouses and other commercial properties.\nBased on the 2020 United States census, the Boston metropolitan area is the tenth largest metropolitan area in the United States. Located\nadjacent to major transportation corridors, the Boston metropolitan area provides a highly diversified economic base, with major employment\nsectors ranging from services, manufacturing and wholesale/retail trade, to finance, technology and medical care. According to the United States\nDepartment of Labor, in December 2022, the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Massachusetts Statistical Area had an unemployment rate of 2.7%,\ncompared to a Massachusetts state unemployment rate of 3.3% and the national unemployment rate of 3.5%.\nBased on United States census estimates, from 2010 to 2020, the populations of Middlesex and Essex Counties increased 128,917 and\n66,670, respectively. The United States census estimates that the median household income from 2015-2019 for Middlesex and Essex Counties\nwere $102,603 and $79,263, respectively, compared to median household income of $71,115 for Boston the metropolitan area, $81,215 for the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts and $62,843 for the United States.\nCompetition\nWe face significant competition within our market both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a high concentration\nof financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks, credit unions and other non-bank financial service\nproviders. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking.\nOur competition for loans comes primarily from the competitors referenced above and from other financial service providers, such as\nmortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from the increasing number of non-depository financial service\ncompanies participating in the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities firms, financial technology companies, specialty finance\nfirms and technology companies.\nWe expect competition to remain intense in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing\ntrend toward consolidation of the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, which have\nallowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions,\nincluding financial technology companies, to offer products\n6\nand services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in the\nfuture.\nWe are a small community savings institution and as of June 30, 2022 (the latest date for which information is available), our market share\nwas 1.60% of total FDIC-insured deposits in Middlesex County, Massachusetts making us the 26th largest out of 51 financial institutions in\nMiddlesex County, and our market share was 0.38% of total FDIC-insured deposits in Essex County, Massachusetts making us the 27th largest out\nof 34 financial institutions in Essex County.\nLending Activities\nOur principal lending activity is originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate and multifamily real\nestate loans, construction and land loans and home equity lines of credit and loans. To a much lesser extent, we also originate commercial and\nconsumer loans. Subject to market conditions and our asset-liability analysis, we expect to continue to grow our commercial real estate and\nmultifamily loan portfolios as well as our one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio. We also originate for sale and sell a portion of\nthe fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate that generally have terms of 15 years or greater, on a servicing-\nreleased, limited or no recourse basis, while retaining shorter-term fixed-rate and all adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans\nin order to manage the duration and time to repricing of our loan portfolio.\nHistorically, given our size, capital position and lending team experience and capacity, we have originated for participation to other local\nbanking institutions our larger commercial real estate and commercial loans. As we continue to enhance our commercial real estate team and\ninfrastructure and with the increase in capital resulting from the conversion, we are able to selectively retain larger loans that we historically\nwould have originated for participation with other local institutions. In this regard, we have revised our lending policies and loans to one borrower\nlimitations to increase our lending limits and the type and size of loans we choose to hold in our portfolio.\nLoan Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio by type of loan at the dates indicated,\nexcluding loans held for sale. We had $0 and $1.3 million loans held for sale at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nAt December 31,\n2022 2021\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nReal estate loans:\nOne- to four-family residential $ 355,381 39.8% $ 259,673 49.8%\nMulti-family 241,951 27.1% 59,517 11.4%\nCommercial 156,212 17.5% 99,953 19.2%\nHome equity lines of credit and loans 27,783 3.1% 26,050 5.0%\nConstruction 107,317 12.0% 70,668 13.5%\nCommercial loans 4,266 0.5% 5,439 1.0%\nConsumer 222 0.0% 500 0.1%\n893,132 100.0% 521,800 100.0%\nLess:\nNet deferred loan fees (258) (433)\nAllowance for losses (7,200) (4,236)\nTotal loans, net $ 885,674 $ 517,131\n7\nLoan Portfolio Maturities and Yields.

The focus of our lending has long been the origination of long-term loans secured\nby mortgages on owner-occupied one- to four-family residences. At December 31, 2022, $355.4 million, or 39.8%, of our total loan portfolio,\nconsisted of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Included in this balance was $106.5 million of non-owner occupied loans. Loans for\nnon-owner occupied properties purchased for investment purposes and where the property income is not the borrower’s primary source of income\nare generally underwritten to Fannie Mae guidelines. Loans for non-owner occupied properties purchased for investment purposes and where the\nproperty income is the primary source of income to the borrower are underwritten based on our commercial real estate underwriting guidelines.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our average outstanding one- to four-family residential real estate loan balance was $400,000 and our largest\noutstanding loan secured by one- to four-family residential restate had a principal balance of $5.0 million, which, as of December 31, 2022, was\nperforming in accordance with its repayment terms. The vast majority of the one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate are\nsecured by properties located in our primary market area. See “ – Originations, Sales and Purchases of Loans.”\nOur one- to four-family residential real estate loans are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae guidelines, and we refer to loans\nthat conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real\nestate loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as\n8\nestablished by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”). We also originate loans above the FHFA limit, which are referred to as “jumbo\nloans.” We generally underwrite jumbo loans in a manner similar to conforming loans. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we originated\n$27.9 million of jumbo loans.\nWe originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Our fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to\nfour-family residential real estate loans are originated with terms of up to 30 years. At December 31, 2022, $121.6 million, or 34.2%, of our one-\nto four-family residential real estate loans were fixed-rate loans.\nWe originate our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans with initial interest rate adjustment periods of three, five,\nseven and 10 years, based on changes in a designated market index. These loans are limited to a 200-basis point initial increase in their interest\nrate, a 200-basis point increase in their interest rate annually after the initial adjustment, and a maximum upward adjustment of 600 basis points\nover the life of the loan. We determine whether a borrower qualifies for an adjustable-rate mortgage loan based on our lending policy.\nWe originate conventional one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 80% without private mortgage\ninsurance. Occasionally, we originate loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 97% with private mortgage insurance and where the borrower’s debt\ngenerally does not exceed 45% of the borrower’s monthly cash-flow.\nA portion of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are for the financing of residential condominium units. Consistent with our\nrisk analysis, we generally will not finance more than 20% of the units in any condominium project with more than four units. In addition, and\nconsistent with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines, generally, we will not make a loan for the purchase of a condominium in a new\ncondominium project unless at least 60% of the total units in the project are sold or under a sales agreement prior to the loan closing.\nGenerally, we sell a portion of the fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate with terms that are generally\ngreater than 15 years. We base the amount of fixed-rate loans that we sell on our liquidity needs, asset/liability mix, loan volume, portfolio size\nand other factors. Currently, the majority of loans that we sell are sold to the secondary market with servicing released.\nWe generally do not offer “interest-only” mortgage loans on one- to four-family residential real estate loans nor do we offer loans that\nprovide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on his loan,\nresulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. Additionally, we do not offer “subprime loans” (loans that are made with low\ndown-payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments,\nbankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans\n(defined as loans having less than full documentation).\nWe evaluate both the borrower’s ability to make principal, interest and escrow payments and the value of the property that will secure the\nloan. Our one- to four-family residential real estate loans do not currently include prepayment penalties, are non-assumable and do not produce\nnegative amortization. Our one- to four-family residential mortgage loans customarily include “due-on-sale” clauses giving us the right to declare\nthe loan immediately due and payable in the event that, among other things, the borrower sells the property subject to the mortgage. All\nborrowers are required to obtain title insurance for the benefit of Everett Co-operative Bank. We also require homeowner’s insurance and fire and\ncasualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance on properties securing real estate loans.\nWe offer one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by non-owner occupied properties. Generally, we will not make loans in\nexcess of 75% loan to value on non-owner-occupied two- to four-family residential real estate properties or in excess of 80% on single family\nnon-owner occupied residential real estate properties.\nCommercial Real Estate and Multifamily Lending. Our commercial real estate loans are secured primarily by multifamily apartment\nbuilding, retail and mixed-use properties, light industrial properties, manufacturing facilities and office buildings, almost all of which are located\nin our primary market area. Our multifamily loans are secured primarily by five or more-unit residential buildings. At December 31, 2022, we had\n$156.2 million in commercial real estate loans and $242.0 million in multifamily real estate loans, representing 17.5% and 27.1% of our total loan\nportfolio, respectively.\n9\nWe generally originate adjustable-rate commercial real estate and multifamily real estate loans with maximum terms of up to 30 years.\nFrom time to time we will also originate fixed rate loans in these portfolios. We generally limit loan-to-value ratios to 75% of the appraised value\nor purchase price, whichever is higher. All of our commercial real estate and multifamily real estate loans are subject to our underwriting\nprocedures and guidelines.\nAt December 31, 2022, our largest commercial real estate loan totaled $10.5 million and was secured by a warehouse distribution center\nlocated in our primary market area. At December 31, 2022, this loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms. At December 31,\n2022, our largest multifamily real estate loan totaled $25.0 million and was secured by three properties with a total of 91 residential units and\nthree commercial units located in our primary market area. At December 31, 2022, this loan was performing in accordance with its repayment\nterms.\nWe consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate and multifamily loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial\ncondition of the borrower (including credit history), profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the mortgaged property\nsecuring the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s\nexperience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the\nproperty securing the loan, among other factors we consider the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and\ndepreciation, the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service) to ensure that, subject to certain exceptions, it is at\nleast 1.20x, and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property. Our commercial real estate and multifamily loans\nare appraised by outside independent and qualified appraisers that are duly approved in accordance with Everett Co-operative Bank policy.\nPersonal guarantees are often obtained from commercial real estate borrowers if such individual has a greater than 20% ownership interest in the\nproperty. Each borrower’s financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates.\nOur loans-to-one borrower limit is 20% of the Bank's capital, which limit was $26.1 million at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022,\nour average commercial real estate loan had a balance of $908,000 and our average multifamily loan had a balance of $3.3 million. As we\ncontinue to enhance our commercial real estate team and infrastructure and with the increase in capital resulting from the conversion, we are now\nable to selectively retain larger loans that we historically would have originated for participation with other local institutions. In this regard, we\nhave revised our lending policies and loans to one borrower limitations to increase our lending limits and the type and size of loans we choose to\nhold in our portfolio.\nConstruction and Land Loans. At December 31, 2022, we had $107.3 million in construction and land loans, or 12.0% of total loans. We\nmake construction loans, primarily to developers, contractors and builders of apartment buildings, single-family homes and condominiums and\nindividuals for the construction of their primary residences. We also make a limited amount of land loans that will be used for residential or\ncommercial development. Land loans also include loans secured by land purchased for investment purposes. At December 31, 2022, our\nconstruction loans included $3.0 million lines of credit secured by land.\nWhile we may originate loans to builders whether or not the collateral property underlying the loan is under contract for sale, we consider\neach project carefully in light of current residential real estate market conditions. Generally, we will make construction loans for which there is no\ncontract for sale for the underlying completed home at the time of origination, and which we refer to as speculative construction loans, only to\nwell-known builders in our market area. We actively monitor the number of unsold homes in our construction loan portfolio and local housing\nmarkets to attempt to maintain an appropriate balance between home sales and new loan originations. We generally will limit the maximum\nnumber of speculative units (units that are not pre-sold) approved for each builder, typically starting with one speculative loan per builder until we\ndevelop a relationship with the builder. At December 31, 2022, speculative construction loans totaled $59.0 million.\nOur construction loans are fixed- and adjustable-rate, interest-only loans that provide for the payment of interest during the construction\nphase, which is usually up to 12 to 24 months or in some cases up to 36 months for more complex projects. At the end of the construction phase,\nthe loan may convert to a permanent mortgage loan or may be paid in full. Depending on the complexity of the construction project, the term of an\n“interest-only” construction loan may be\n10\nextended if circumstances warrant it up to an additional three to six months. At December 31, 2022, the additional unadvanced portions of these\nconstruction loans totaled $72.4 million.\nConstruction and land loans are generally limited to 80% (75% for investment properties) loan-to-completed-appraised-value ratio upon\ncompletion of the project. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent\nlicensed appraiser. We also generally require inspections of the property before disbursements of funds during the term of the construction loan.\nAt December 31, 2022, our largest construction loan was for $17.0 million and was for the construction of a multifamily apartment building\nin our market area, $1.7 million of which was outstanding. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms at December 31,\n2022.\nHome Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. In addition to one- to four-family residential real estate loans, we offer home equity loans and\nlines of credit that are secured by the borrower’s primary or secondary residence. At December 31, 2022, we had $27.8 million, or 3.1%, of our\ntotal loan portfolio in home equity loans and lines of credit. At that date we also had $42.5 million of unused commitments related to home equity\nlines of credit.\nHome equity loans and lines of credit are generally underwritten using the same criteria that we use to underwrite one- to four-family\nresidential real estate loans. Home equity loans and lines of credit may be underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 70%, or 80% when\ncombined with the principal balance of the existing first mortgage loan. Our home equity loans are primarily originated with fixed rates of interest\nwith terms of up to 15 years. Our home equity lines of credit are originated with adjustable-rates based on the prime rate of interest plus or minus\nan applicable margin with a floor rate and require interest paid monthly.\nHome equity loans and lines of credit are generally secured by junior mortgages and have greater risk than one- to four-family residential\nreal estate loans secured by first mortgages. We face the risk that the collateral will be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses and costs of\nforeclosure, after repayment of the senior mortgages, if applicable. When customers default on their loans, we attempt to foreclose on the property\nand resell the property as soon as possible to minimize foreclosure and carrying costs. However, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient\nto compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from those customers.\nParticularly with respect to our home equity loans and lines of credit, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect our ability to fully\nrecover the loan balance in the event of a default.\nCommercial Loans. At December 31, 2022, commercial loans were $4.3 million, or 0.5% of total loans. This amount includes loans\noriginated under the PPP, which are described below.\nWe make commercial loans and lines of credit primarily to small businesses in our market area. These loans and lines of credit are generally\nsecured by business assets, such as equipment and accounts receivable. Commercial loans and lines of credit are made with both adjustable and\nfixed-interest rates and for terms generally up to 60 months or on demand. Depending on the collateral used to secure the loans, commercial loans\nare made in amounts of up to 80% of the value of the collateral securing the loan.\nWhen making commercial loans, we consider the financial statements of the borrower, our lending history with the borrower, the debt\nservice capabilities and global cash flows of the borrower and other guarantors, the projected cash flows of the business and the value of the\ncollateral, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.\nThe CARES Act established the PPP through the SBA, which allowed us to lend money to small businesses to maintain employee payrolls\nthrough the COVID-19 crisis with guarantees from the SBA. PPP loans may be forgiven if the borrower maintains employee payrolls and meet\ncertain other requirements. PPP loans have a fixed interest rate of 1.00% per annum and a maturity date of either two or five years. PPP loans\ntotaled $121,000, or 0.01% of total loans, at December 31, 2022. We anticipate that all PPP loans will be forgiven by the SBA.\nAt December 31, 2022, our largest commercial loan totaled $862,000 and was secured by business assets. At December 31, 2022, this loan\nwas performing in accordance with its repayment terms.\n11\nConsumer Lending. To a much lesser extent, we offer a variety of consumer loans to individuals who reside or work in our market area,\nincluding new and used automobile loans, unsecured overdraft lines of credit and loans secured by savings accounts. At December 31, 2022, our\nconsumer loan portfolio totaled $222,000, or 0.02%, of our total loan portfolio.\nConsumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management\nbelieves that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of\ncustomer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities.\nLoan Underwriting Risks\nAdjustable-Rate Residential Real Estate Loans. Although adjustable-rate mortgage loans may reduce to an extent our vulnerability to\nchanges in market interest rates because they periodically reprice, as interest rates increase, the required payments due from the borrower also\nincrease (subject to rate caps), increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral\nmay be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustments of the contractual interest rate are also limited by the maximum periodic\nand lifetime rate adjustments permitted by our loan documents.\nCommercial Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by commercial real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of\nrisk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans. The primary concern in commercial real estate lending is the borrower’s\ncreditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on\nsuccessful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject, to a greater extent than residential\nreal estate loans, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require\nborrowers and loan guarantors to provide quarterly, semi-annual or annual financial statements, depending on the size of the loan, on commercial\nreal estate loans. In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider and review a global cash flow analysis of\nthe borrower and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability and the value of the\nunderlying property. We have generally required that the properties securing these real estate loans have an aggregate debt service ratio, including\nthe guarantor’s cash flows and the borrower’s other projects, of at least 1.20x. An environmental phase one report is obtained when the possibility\nexists that hazardous materials may have existed on the site, or the site may have been impacted by adjoining properties that handled hazardous\nmaterials.\nIf we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be lengthy\nwith substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting\nsale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending\non the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial. As\nof December 31, 2022, we maintained no “other real estate owned” as a result of foreclosures (or the acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure).\nCommercial Loans. Unlike residential real estate loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment\nfrom his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable,\ncommercial loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flows of the\nborrower’s business, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our commercial loans are originated primarily based on the\nidentified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Collateral for commercial loans\ntypically consists of accounts receivable, inventory or equipment. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans is based on the\nliquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate\nover time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans\nmay depend substantially on the success of the business itself.\n12\nConstruction and Land Loans. Our construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the completed project.\nUnderwriting is focused on the borrowers’ financial strength, credit history and demonstrated ability to produce a quality product and effectively\nmarket and manage their operations.\nConstruction lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent lending because funds are advanced upon the security of the\nproject, which is of uncertain value before its completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the\nmarket value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the\ntotal funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. In addition, generally during the term of a construction loan, interest\nmay be funded by the borrower or disbursed from an interest reserve set aside from the construction loan budget. These loans often involve the\ndisbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to\nsell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and\ninterest. If the appraised value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan\nupon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. In addition, speculative construction loans, which are loans made to home\nbuilders who, at the time of loan origination, have not yet secured an end buyer for the home under construction, typically carry higher risks than\nthose associated with traditional construction loans. These increased risks arise because of the risk that there will be inadequate demand to ensure\nthe sale of the property within an acceptable time. As a result, in addition to the risks associated with traditional construction loans, speculative\nconstruction loans carry the added risk that the builder will have to pay the property taxes and other carrying costs of the property until an end\nbuyer is found. Land loans have substantially similar risks to speculative construction loans.\nOriginations, Sales and Purchases of Loans\nOur loan originations are generated by our loan personnel operating at our banking office. All loans we originate are underwritten pursuant\nto our policies and procedures. While we originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends\nupon relative borrower demand and the pricing levels as set in the local marketplace by competing banks, thrifts, credit unions, and mortgage\nbanking companies. Our volume of real estate loan originations is influenced significantly by market interest rates, and, accordingly, the volume\nof our real estate loan originations can vary from period to period.\nConsistent with our interest rate risk management strategy, we originate for sale and sell a portion of the fixed-rate, one- to four-family\nresidential real estate loans that we originate with terms of 15 years or greater, on a servicing-released, limited or no recourse basis, while\nretaining shorter-term fixed-rate and all adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to manage the duration and time to\nrepricing of our loan portfolio. We consider our balance sheet as well as market conditions on an ongoing basis in making decisions as to whether\nto hold loans we originate for investment or to sell such loans to investors, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a\nprofitability and risk management standpoint. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold $5.7 million of one- to four-family owner-\noccupied residential real estate loans. Subject to market and economic conditions, management intends to continue this sales activity in future\nperiods to generate gain on sale income.\nFrom time to time, we may purchase loan participations secured by properties within and outside of our primary market area in which we\nare not the lead lender. In these circumstances, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. At December 31, 2022, we had\ntwo loans in which we were not the lead lender totaling $15.5 million. We may participate out portions of a loan that exceeded our loans-to-one\nborrower legal lending limit and for risk diversification. In addition, during 2022, we purchased $16.8 million in whole one- to four- family\nresidential real estate loans from correspondent loan originators.\nAt December 31, 2022, we did not have any loans held for sale.\nLoan Approval Procedures and Authority\nThe maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities is generally limited, by statute, to 20% of the\nBank's capital, which is defined under Massachusetts law as the sum of our surplus account,\n13\nundivided profits and, after the completion of the conversion, capital stock. Loans secured by a first mortgage on residential property occupied by\nthe borrower are excluded from this limit. At December 31, 2022, our regulatory limit on loans-to-one borrower was $26.1 million. At December\n31, 2022, our largest lending relationship consisted of one multifamily real estate loan totaling $25.0 million and was secured by three properties\nwith a total of 91 residential units and three commercial units located in our primary market area. This loan relationship was performing in\naccordance with its original repayment terms at December 31, 2022. Our second largest relationship at this date consisted of two loans totaling\n$24.8 million secured by 79 residential units in our market area that was performing in accordance with its terms. As a result of the offering, our\nregulatory loans-to-one borrower limit has increased and, as we continue to enhance our commercial real estate team and infrastructure and our\nincreased capital position resulting from the conversion, we are now able to selectively retain larger loans that we historically would have\noriginated for participation with other local institutions. In this regard, we have revised our lending policies and loans to one borrower limitations\nto increase our lending limits and the type and size of loans we choose to hold in our portfolio.\nOur lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures. Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis\nof detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower and property valuations (consistent with our appraisal policy) prepared by outside\nindependent licensed or certified appraisers approved by our board of directors as well as internal evaluations, where permitted by regulations.\nThe loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant items on the\napplication are verified through use of credit reports, financial statements and tax returns.\nThe board of directors has overall responsibility for our lending policy, and the board reviews this policy at least annually.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Lending Officer each have individual lending authority for up to $1.0\nmillion for residential or commercial loans. Loans of between $1.0 million and $3.5 million require the approval of the Loan Committee, which is\ncomprised of senior management of the Bank as well as the Chief Executive Officer, and loans or relationships in excess of $3.5 million require\napproval of the full board of directors. Additionally, our policies and loan approval limits which are established by the board of directors provide\nvarious lending approval authority for other designated individual officers or officers acting together.\nGenerally, we require title insurance on our mortgage loans as well as fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in amounts at least\nequal to the principal amount of the loan or the value of improvements on the property, depending on the type of loan. We also require flood\ninsurance if the improved property is determined to be in a flood zone area.\nDelinquencies and Non-Performing Assets\nDelinquency Procedures. When a borrower fails to make required payments on a loan, we take a number of steps to induce the borrower\nto cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. We generally send a written notice of non-payment to the borrower 15, 30, 60 and\n90 days after a loan is first past due. We will additionally try to contact the borrower by telephone after the 30th day after the due date.\nGenerally, when a loan becomes 90 days past due, the loan is turned over to our attorneys to ensure that further collection activities are\nconducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. All loans past due 90 days are put on non-accrual and reported to the board of\ndirectors monthly. If our attorneys do not receive a response from the borrower, or if the terms of any payment plan established are not followed,\nthen foreclosure proceedings will be implemented. Management submits a delinquent loan report detailing loans 30 days or more past due to the\nboard of directors on a monthly basis.\nWhen we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed real estate\nuntil it is sold. The real estate is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition less estimated costs to sell, and any write-down\nresulting from the acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Estimated fair value is based on an appraisal typically obtained before\nthe foreclosure process is completed. Subsequent decreases in the value of the property are charged to operations. After acquisition, all costs\nincurred in maintaining the\n14\nproperty are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair\nvalue less estimated costs to sell.\nA loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring if, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, we grant\na concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider. This usually includes a modification of loan terms, such as a reduction of the\ninterest rate to below market terms, capitalizing past due interest or extending the maturity date and possibly a partial forgiveness of the principal\namount due. Interest income on restructured loans is accrued after the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay under the restructured terms\nthrough a sustained period of repayment performance, which is generally six consecutive months.\nDelinquent Loans.

Federal regulations provide that each insured savings institution classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in\nconnection with examination of insured depository institutions, federal and Massachusetts banking regulators have authority to identify problem\nassets and, if appropriate, classify them. There are three classifications for problem assets: “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is\nconsidered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if\nany. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the\ndeficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the\nadded characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and\nvalues, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their\ncontinuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured\ninstitution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special\nmention” by our management.\nWhen an insured depository institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an\namount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been\nestablished to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to\nparticular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for\nlosses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification\nof its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory agencies, which may require the establishment of\nadditional general or specific loss allowances.\n16\nIn connection with the filing of our quarterly reports with the FDIC and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly\nreview the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations.\nOn the basis of this review of our assets, our classified and special mention assets at the dates indicated were as follows:\nAt December 31,\n2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nSubstandard assets $ — $ —\nDoubtful assets — —\nLoss assets — —\nTotal classified assets $ — $ —\nSpecial mention assets $ 467 $ 1,563\nForeclosed real estate and other assets $ — $ —\nOther Loans of Concern. There were no other loans at December 31, 2022 that are not already disclosed where there is information about\npossible credit problems of borrowers that caused management to have serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with present\nloan repayment terms and that may result in disclosure of such loans in the future.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which, in management’s judgment, is adequate to\nabsorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on management’s evaluation of the collectability\nof the loan portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specific impaired loans, and\neconomic conditions. Allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash\nflows. Because of uncertainties associated with regional economic conditions, collateral values, and future cash flows on impaired loans, it is\nreasonably possible that management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change\nmaterially in the near-term. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is charged to expense and reduced by full and partial\ncharge-offs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses.\nManagement’s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on various factors, including, but not limited to, management’s\nongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due\nand non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic\nconditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. We adopted the Current Expected Credit Loss\n(CECL) methodology on January 1, 2023. This methodology replaces the existing incurred loss and impairment methodology in current GAAP\nwith a methodology referred to as CECL. This methodology reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of historical experience,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Financial institutions will now use forward-looking\ninformation to estimate the expected credit loss on a loan at the time of origination. Credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities will be\nmeasured in a manner similar to current GAAP but will be recognized through an allowance rather than as a direct writedown. Upon the adoption\nof the change in methodology, the change from the incurred loss methodology to the CECL methodology will be recognized through an\nadjustment to retained earnings. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated\nfinancial statements, which is expected to be significant. Management is still finalizing the analysis of its current expected credit loss\nmethodology and has not yet estimated the impact that this guidance will have on our allowance for loan losses.\nAs an integral part of their examination process, the Commissioner and the FDIC will periodically review our allowance for loan losses,\nand as a result of such reviews, we may determine to adjust our allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved\nin the process for establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the\nresponsibility of management.\n17\nThe following table sets forth activity in our allowance for loan losses for the years indicated\nAt December 31,\n2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nAllowance for loan losses at beginning of year $ 4,236 $ 3,876\nProvision for loan losses 2,940 360\nCharge-offs:\nReal estate loans:\nOne- to four-family residential — —\nMulti-family — —\nCommercial — —\nHome equity lines of credit and loans — —\nConstruction — —\nCommercial — —\nConsumer (2) (1)\nTotal charge-offs $ (2) $ (1)\nRecoveries:\nReal estate loans:\nOne- to four-family residential — —\nMulti-family — —\nCommercial 25 —\nHome equity lines of credit and loans — —\nConstruction — —\nCommercial — —\nConsumer 1 1\nTotal recoveries 26 1\nNet recoveries $ 24 $ —\nAllowance for loan losses at end of year $ 7,200 $ 4,236\nAllowance for loan losses to non-performing loans 1097.56% 431.5%\nAllowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding\nat end of year 0.81% 0.81%\nNet recoveries to average loans\noutstanding during the year 0.00% 0.00%\n18\nAllocation of Allowance for Loan Losses.

Our investment policy is established by the board of directors. The objectives of the policy are to: (i) provide and maintain\nliquidity within the guidelines of the Massachusetts banking laws and regulations for loan demand and deposit fluctuations, and to allow us to\nalter our liquidity position to meet both day-to-day and long-term changes in assets and liabilities; (ii) manage interest rate risk in accordance with\nour interest rate risk policy; (iii) provide collateral for pledging requirements; (iv) maximize return on our investments; and (v) maintain a balance\nof high quality diversified investments to minimize risk.\nWe have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-\nsponsored enterprises and municipal governments, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the “FHLB”), certificates of deposit of\nfederally insured institutions, investment grade corporate bonds and investment grade marketable equity securities. We also are required to\nmaintain an investment in FHLB stock. While we have the authority under applicable law to invest in derivative securities, we have not invested\nin derivative securities.\nAt December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of debt securities issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises,\nmortgage-backed securities and corporate debt securities.\nOur investment policy is reviewed annually by our board of directors and all policy changes recommended by management must be\napproved by the board. Authority to make investments under the approved guidelines are delegated to appropriate officers. While general\ninvestment strategies are developed and authorized by the board, the execution of specific actions with respect to securities held by Everett Co-\noperative Bank rests with the Chief Financial Officer within the scope of the established investment policy.\nAt the time of purchase, we designate a security as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent.\nSecurities available-for-sale or trading are reported at fair value, while securities held-to-maturity are reported at amortized cost. Consistent with\nour overall business and asset/liability management plan, which focuses on sustaining adequate levels of core earnings, the base premise of our\ninvestment portfolio is that all securities purchased will be suitable to be held-to-maturity. At December 31, 2022, $77.6 million, or 93.9%, of our\nsecurities portfolio was comprised of held-to-maturity securities.\n19\nSome of our securities are callable by the issuer. Although these securities may have a yield somewhat higher than the yield of similar\nsecurities without such features, these securities are subject to the risk that they may be redeemed by the issuer prior to maturing in the event\ngeneral interest rates decline. At December 31, 2022, we had $10.1 million of securities which were subject to redemption by the issuer prior to\ntheir stated maturity.\nWe review debt securities with significant declines in fair value on a periodic basis to determine whether they should be considered\ntemporarily or other than temporarily impaired. In making these determinations, management considers: (1) the length of time and extent that fair\nvalue has been less than amortized cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was\naffected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) our intent not to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to\nsell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. For fixed maturity investments with unrealized losses due to interest rates where it is not\nmore likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, declines in value below cost are not assumed\nto be other than temporary. If a decline in the fair value of a debt security is determined to be other than temporary, the amount of impairment is\nsplit into two components as follows: (1) other than temporary impairment related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the income\nstatement and (2) other than temporary impairment related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. The credit loss is\ndefined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows to be expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. There were no\ncharges related to other than temporary impairment on securities held by us during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAt December 31, 2022, our corporate bond portfolio consisted of investment grade securities with maturities generally shorter than ten\nyears. Our investment policy provides that we may invest up to 10% of our tier-one risk-based capital in corporate bonds from individual issuers\nwhich, at the time of purchase, are within the three highest investment-grade ratings from Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s. The maturity of these\nbonds generally may not exceed five years unless approved by the board of directors, and the aggregate limit is 50% of the investment portfolio\nfor this security type. Bonds that subsequently experience a decline in credit rating below investment grade are monitored at least quarterly.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding source for our benefit plan obligations.\nBank-owned life insurance also generally provides us noninterest income that is non-taxable. Applicable regulations generally limit our\ninvestment in bank-owned life insurance to 25% of our Tier 1 capital plus our allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2022, we had $14.1\nmillion in bank-owned life insurance.\nOther Securities. We hold common stock of the FHLB in connection with our borrowing activities. The FHLB common stock is carried at\ncost and classified as restricted equity securities. It is not practicable to determine the fair value of FHLB common stock due to restrictions placed\non its transferability. Under current FHLB rules, we will be required to purchase additional FHLB common stock if we increase borrowings in the\nfuture.\n20\nSecurities Portfolio. The following tables set forth the stated maturities and weighted average yields of our investment securities which are\nclassified as held-to-maturity and available-for-sale at December 31, 2022. Certain mortgage-backed securities have adjustable interest rates and\nwill reprice annually within the various maturity ranges.

Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use\nborrowings to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In\naddition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, loan sales, retained earnings and income on\nearning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows\ncan vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.\nDeposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from residents within our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts,\nincluding noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit.\nDeposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on\ndeposit and the interest rate. In recent years, we have also accepted brokered deposits as non-retail funding source to fund our operations. These\nnon-core funding sources are not relationship-based accounts and are generally more price-sensitive than our core deposits. Therefore, these\ndeposits carry a greater risk of non-renewal than our core deposits. At December 31, 2022, our core deposits, which are deposits other than\ncertificates of deposit and brokered deposits, were $398.3 million, representing 55.5% of total deposits. At December 31, 2022, we had one\nmunicipal deposit relationship in the amount of $23.1 million.\nIn November 2021 we hired Cary Lynch as our new Senior Vice President of Retail Operations. Mr. Lynch has 36 years of community\nbanking experience, including 30 years in the greater Boston metropolitan area, and he is overseeing our efforts to ensure that our products,\nservices and accessibility will continue to make Everett Co-operative Bank a competitive community bank, and will continue to attract and retain\nretail customers by emphasizing personal service, accessibility and flexibility. Some of the programs and efforts we are pursuing in these areas\ninclude: introducing a new mobile and on-line bank interface; offering merchant services programs to enhance the small business customer\nexperience at Everett Co-operative Bank; providing new on-line account operations to enhance and facilitate new customer acquisitions; and\noffering cash management services.\nInterest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based\nprimarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. The flow of\ndeposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that\nwe offer allows us to be competitive in generating deposits and to respond with flexibility to changes in our customers’ demands. Our ability to\ngather deposits is impacted by the competitive market in which we operate, which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes\noffering a wide range of products. We believe that deposits are a stable source of funds, but our ability to attract and maintain deposits at\nfavorable rates will be affected by market conditions, including competition and prevailing interest rates.\n22\nThe following table sets forth the distribution of total deposits, by account type, at the dates indicated.\nAt December 31,\n2022 2021\nAverage Average\nAmount Percent Rate Amount Percent Rate\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNoninterest-bearing demand\n$ 84,903 11.8% 0.00% $ 83,311 14.6% 0.00%\ndeposits\nInterest-bearing demand deposits 28,942 4.0% 0.10% 28,333 5.0% 0.18%\nRegular savings deposits and\n148,351 20.7% 2.12% 50,044 8.8% 0.05%\nother deposits\nMoney market deposits 136,106 19.0% 1.11% 183,246 32.0% 0.28%\nCertificates of deposit 319,847 44.5% 2.31% 226,820 39.7% 0.98%\nTotal $ 718,149 100.0% $ 571,754 100.0%\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate amount of deposits in amounts greater than $250,000, which is the maximum amount for\nfederal deposit insurance, was $330.5 million and $172.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of all our\ncertificates of deposit in excess of $250,000 was $98.4 million.\nAll of our deposits are fully insured due to the additional insurance provided to a Massachusetts cooperative bank, such as Everett Co-\noperative Bank, under the Depositors Insurance Fund, a private industry-sponsored insurance fund in Massachusetts that insures all deposits at\nEverett Co-operative Bank above FDIC limits.\nBorrowing Capacity. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, Everett Co-operative Bank is eligible to obtain advances\nupon the security of the Federal Home Loan Bank common stock owned and certain residential mortgage loans, provided certain standards related\nto credit-worthiness have been met. Federal Home Loan Bank advances are available pursuant to several credit programs, each of which has its\nown interest rate and range of maturities. At December 31, 2022, we had the ability to borrow an additional $84.8 million from the Federal Home\nLoan Bank of Boston, subject to certain collateral requirements and had advances of $174.0 million at such date.\nSubsidiary and Other Activities\nEverett Co-operative Bank is the wholly owned subsidiary of ECB Bancorp.\nEverett Co-operative Bank has one subsidiary, First Everett Securities Corporation, Inc. (“FESC, Inc.”), a Massachusetts corporation, which\nis engaged in the buying, selling and holding of investment securities. The income earned on FESC, Inc.’s securities is subject to a significantly\nlower rate of state tax than that assessed on income earned on securities maintained at Everett Co-operative Bank. At December 31, 2022, FESC,\nInc. had total assets of $47.2 million, substantially all of which were in securities and cash to be invested.\nExpense and Tax Allocation\nEverett Co-operative Bank has entered into an agreement with ECB Bancorp to provide it with certain administrative support services for\ncompensation not less than the fair market value of the services provided. In addition, Everett Co-operative Bank and ECB Bancorp has entered\ninto an agreement to establish a method for allocating and for reimbursing the payment of their consolidated tax liability.\nPersonnel\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had 66 full-time equivalent employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining\ngroup. Management believes that we have a good working relationship with our employees.\n23\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\nGeneral\nEverett Co-operative Bank is a Massachusetts-chartered stock cooperative bank and is the wholly owned subsidiary of ECB Bancorp, a\nMaryland corporation, which is a registered bank holding company. Everett Co-operative Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by\nthe FDIC and by the Depositors Insurance Fund for amounts in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. Everett Co-operative Bank is subject to\nextensive regulation by the Commissioner, as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, its primary federal regulator and deposit insurer. Everett Co-\noperative Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the Commissioner concerning its activities and\nfinancial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or\nacquisitions of other financial institutions. As a registered bank holding company, ECB Bancorp is regulated by the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve Board (the “Federal Reserve Board”). Everett Co-operative Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan\nBank of Boston, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.\nUnder this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement,\nrulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels; restrict the timing and\namount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; provide oversight for the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes\nand the adequacy of its risk management framework; and establish the timing and amounts of assessments and fees imposed by the regulatory\nagencies. Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions\nrelating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings and other factors. These ratings rely on the supervisor’s judgment and the receipt\nof a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial\ninstitution. A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as Everett Co-operative Bank or its holding company, from\nobtaining necessary regulatory approvals to access the capital markets, pay dividends, acquire other financial institutions or establish new\nbranches.\nIn addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act\nlaws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations. Everett Co-operative Bank must comply with consumer protection regulations issued\nby the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as enforced by the FDIC. Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties\nand other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our business activities,\nincluding our ability to acquire other financial institutions or expand our branch network.\nAs a bank holding company, ECB Bancorp is required to comply with the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the rules\nand regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by\nand the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board may directly examine the subsidiaries of a\nbank holding company, including Everett Co-operative Bank. ECB Bancorp is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission under the federal securities laws.\nAny change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the Massachusetts legislature, the Commissioner, the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or Congress, could have a material adverse\nimpact on the operations and financial performance of ECB Bancorp and Everett Co-operative Bank.\nSet forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are applicable to Everett Co-operative Bank and ECB\nBancorp. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete\ndescription of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Everett Co-operative Bank and ECB Bancorp.\n24\nMassachusetts Banking Laws and Supervision\nGeneral. As a Massachusetts-chartered cooperative bank, Everett Co-operative Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination\nby the Commissioner and to various Massachusetts statutes and regulations which govern, among other things, investment powers, lending and\ndeposit-taking activities, borrowings, maintenance of surplus and reserve accounts, distribution of earnings and payment of dividends. In addition,\nEverett Co-operative Bank is subject to Massachusetts consumer protection, Community Reinvestment Act, civil rights laws and regulations. The\napproval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required for a Massachusetts-chartered bank to establish or close branches, merge with\nother financial institutions, issue stock and undertake certain other activities.\nMassachusetts regulations generally allow Massachusetts banks, with appropriate regulatory approvals, to engage in activities permissible\nfor federally chartered banks or banks chartered by another state. The Commissioner also has adopted procedures reducing regulatory burdens and\nexpense and expediting branching by well-capitalized and well-managed banks.\nDividends. A Massachusetts stock bank may declare cash dividends from net profits not more frequently than quarterly. Noncash dividends\nmay be declared at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited or paid if the bank’s capital stock is impaired. The approval of the\nCommissioner is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with\nits retained net profits of the preceding two years. Dividends from ECB Bancorp may depend, in part, upon receipt of dividends from Everett Co-\noperative Bank. The payment of dividends from Everett Co-operative Bank would be restricted by federal law if the payment of such dividends\nresulted in Everett Co-operative Bank failing to meet regulatory capital requirements.\nLoans to One Borrower Limitations. Massachusetts banking law grants broad lending authority. However, with certain limited exceptions,\ntotal obligations to one borrower may not exceed 20% of the total of an institution's capital stock (if any), surplus and undivided profits. The\nCommissioner applies the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s attribution rules to a borrower’s related interests. At December 31, 2022,\nEverett Co-operative Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.\nLoans to a Bank’s Insiders. Under Massachusetts law, a Massachusetts-chartered bank must comply with Regulation O of the Federal\nReserve Board and the Commissioner retains examination and enforcement authority to ensure compliance.\nInvestment Activities. In general, Massachusetts-chartered banks may invest in preferred and common stock of any corporation organized\nunder the laws of the United States or any state provided such investments do not involve control of any corporation and do not, in the aggregate,\nexceed 4% of the bank’s deposits. Federal law imposes additional restrictions on Everett Co-operative Bank’s investment activities.\nRegulatory Enforcement Authority. Any Massachusetts bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and\ndirectives of the Commissioner may be subject to sanctions for noncompliance, including revocation of its charter. The Commissioner may, under\ncertain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the bank’s business in an unsafe or unsound\nmanner or contrary to the depositors’ interests or been negligent in the performance of their duties. Upon finding that a bank has engaged in an\nunfair or deceptive act or practice, the Commissioner may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the bank concerned. The\nCommissioner also has authority to take possession of a bank and appoint the FDIC as receiver under certain conditions such as an unsafe and\nunsound condition to transact business, the conduct of business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner or impaired capital. In addition,\nMassachusetts consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to Everett Co-operative Bank permit private individual and class action law\nsuits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’\nfees in the case of certain violations of those statutes.\nExcess Deposit Insurance Fund. All Massachusetts-chartered cooperative banks are members of the Depositors Insurance Fund, a private\nindustry-sponsored insurance fund in Massachusetts that insures all deposits at Everett Co-operative Bank above FDIC limits.\n25\nProtection of Personal Information. Massachusetts banking regulations contain requirements intended to protect personal information and\nare similar to federal laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, discussed below under “ – Federal Regulations – Other Regulations,” that require\norganizations to establish written information security programs to prevent identity theft. The Massachusetts regulation also contains technology\nsystem requirements, especially for the encryption of personal information sent over wireless or public networks or stored on portable devices.\nInsurance Sales. Massachusetts banks may engage in insurance sales activities if the Commissioner has approved a plan of operation for\ninsurance activities and the bank obtains a license from the Massachusetts Division of Insurance. A bank may be licensed directly or indirectly\nthrough an affiliate or a subsidiary corporation established for this purpose. Everett Co-operative Bank does not sell or refer insurance products,\nand has not sought approval for insurance sales activities.\nParity Regulation. A Massachusetts bank may exercise any power and engage in any activity that has been authorized for national banks,\nfederal thrifts or state banks in a state other than Massachusetts, provided that the activity is permissible under applicable federal law and not\nspecifically prohibited by Massachusetts law. Such powers and activities must be subject to the same limitations and restrictions imposed on the\nnational bank, federal thrift or out-of-state bank that exercised the power or activity.\nMassachusetts has other statutes or regulations that are similar to certain of the federal provisions discussed below.\nFederal Regulations\nCapital Requirements. Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a\ncommon equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based\nassets ratio of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.\nIn determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet\nassets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk-weight factor assigned by the regulations\nbased on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk.\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common shareholders’ equity and related surplus and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is\ngenerally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain non-cumulative perpetual\npreferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital\n(common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related\nsurplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory\nconvertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan losses limited\nto a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified\nin the regulations. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative\nfactors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.\nIn addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary\nbonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital\nto risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nFederal law required the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, to establish a “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8% and\n10% for institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. Institutions with capital complying with the ratio and otherwise meeting\nthe specified requirements and electing the alternative framework are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements,\nincluding the risk-based requirements. The community bank leverage ratio was established at 9% Tier 1 capital to total average assets, effective\nJanuary 1, 2020. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. An\n26\ninstitution that temporarily ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two-quarter grace period to regain compliance. Failure to meet\nthe qualifying criteria within the grace period or maintain a leverage ratio of 8% or greater requires the institution to comply with the generally\napplicable regulatory capital requirements.\nAt December 31, 2022, Everett Co-operative Bank had not opted into the community bank leverage ratio framework and its capital ratios\nexceeded all applicable requirements.\nCapital Distributions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act generally provides that an insured depository institution may not make any\ncapital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. Unless the\napproval of the FDIC is obtained, Everett Co-operative Bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during the\ncalendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the sum of its net income during the current calendar year and the retained net income of\nthe prior two calendar years.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All insured depository institutions have a responsibility under the Community\nReinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. The\nFDIC is required to assess Everett Co-operative Bank’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. An institution’s failure to\ncomply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as\nbranches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders\nfrom discriminating in their lending practices. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result\nin enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. Everett Co-operative Bank\nreceived a “Satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination.\nMassachusetts has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA which is also applicable to Everett Co-operative Bank. The Massachusetts\nversion is generally similar to the CRA but utilizes a five-tiered descriptive rating system. Massachusetts law requires the Commissioner to\nconsider, but not be limited to, a bank’s record of performance under Massachusetts law in considering any application by the bank to establish a\nbranch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any\nother banking institution. Everett Co-operative Bank’s most recent 2022 CRA performance rating under Massachusetts law was “Satisfactory.”\nTransactions with Related Parties. An insured depository institution’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is generally\nlimited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under\ncommon control with, an insured depository institution such as Everett Co-operative Bank. ECB Bancorp will be an affiliate of Everett Co-\noperative Bank because of its control of Everett Co-operative Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its\naffiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a state-chartered bank from\nlending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities\nof any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve\nthe purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.\nEverett Co-operative Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities\ncontrolled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of\nthe Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders:\n• be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those\nprevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or\npresent other unfavorable features; and\n27\n• not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are\nbased, in part, on the amount of Everett Co-operative Bank’s capital.\nIn addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Everett Co-operative Bank’s board of directors. Extensions\nof credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.\nEnforcement. As a non-member bank, Everett Co-operative Bank’s primary federal regulator is the FDIC which has authority to bring\nenforcement actions against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, shareholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants\nwho knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action\nby the FDIC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal and prohibition of officers and/or directors of\nthe institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to\n$25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day, subject to inflation\nadjustments. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate federal deposit insurance.\nStandards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for the insured\ndepository institutions they supervise. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems,\nloan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation and benefits, and other\noperational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that\nthe federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the\nappropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require\nthe institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards,\nthe appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan\ncan result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order and/or the imposition of civil money penalties.\nBranching. Federal law permits insured state banks to engage in interstate branching if the laws of the state where the new banking office\nis to be established would permit the establishment of the banking office if it were chartered by a bank in such state. Under current Massachusetts\nlaw, Everett Co-operative Bank can establish a branch in Massachusetts or in any other state. All branch applications require prior approval of the\nCommissioner and the FDIC. Finally, Everett Co-operative Bank may also establish banking offices in other states by merging with banks or by\npurchasing banking offices of other banks in other states, subject to certain restrictions.\nPrompt Corrective Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal banking agencies take “prompt corrective action” with\nrespect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the FDIC’s regulations establish five capital categories:\nwell capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under applicable\nregulations, an institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital\nratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately\ncapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0%\nor greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less\nthan 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%.\nAn institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital\nratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be\n“critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.\nAt each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including\nrestrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends, and restrictions on\nthe acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is\nrequired to submit a capital restoration plan to the\n28\nappropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank\nthat is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category\nif the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or\nunsound practice, warrants such treatment. An undercapitalized bank’s compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by\nany company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed\nundercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an\nacceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a\nnumber of additional restrictions, including a regulatory order to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to\nreduce total assets, ceasing receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, dismissal of directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid\non deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions\nare subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it\nobtains such status.\nThe previously referenced final rule establishing an elective “community bank leverage ratio” regulatory capital framework provides that a\nqualifying institution whose capital exceeds the community bank leverage ratio and opts to use that framework will be considered “well-\ncapitalized” for purposes of prompt corrective action.\nAt December 31, 2022, Everett Co-operative Bank met the criteria for being considered “well capitalized.”\nInsurance of Deposit Accounts. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions such as\nEverett Co-operative Bank, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. The FDIC charges insured depository\ninstitutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nUnder the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky of failure pay lower assessments. Assessments for\ninstitutions of less than $10 billion of assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating\nthe probability of an institution's failure within three years.\nIn June 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule that mitigates the deposit insurance assessment effects of participating in certain COVID-19\nliquidity facilities. The FDIC will generally remove the effect of PPP lending in calculating an institution’s deposit insurance assessment. The final\nrule also provides an offset to an institution’s total assessment amount for the increase in its assessment base attributable to participation in the\nPPP.\nThe FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating\nexpenses and results of operations of Everett Co-operative Bank. In October 2022 the FDIC increased initial base deposit insurance assessment\nrate schedules by 2 basis points, effective January 1, 2023. We cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.\nInsurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an\nunsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.\nEverett Co-operative Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of its deposit insurance.\nPrivacy Regulations. Federal regulations generally require that Everett Co-operative Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying\nwith whom it shares a customer’s “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and\nannually thereafter. In addition, Everett Co-operative Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having their\npersonal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for\nmarketing purposes. Everett Co-operative Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance\nwith the regulations.\nUSA PATRIOT Act. Everett Co-operative Bank is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gives federal agencies additional powers to\naddress terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance\n29\npowers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act contains provisions intended\nto encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies and imposes affirmative obligations on financial\ninstitutions, such as enhanced recordkeeping and customer identification requirements.\nProhibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Everett Co-operative Bank is prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to\nor offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer\nobtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.\nOther Regulations\nInterest and other charges collected or contracted for by Everett Co-operative Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws\nconcerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:\n• Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to\ndetermine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;\n• Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;\n• Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and\n• Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.\nThe deposit operations of Everett Co-operative Bank also are subject to, among others, the:\n• Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes\nprocedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;\n• Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images\nand copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and\n• Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from\ndeposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking\nservices.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System\nEverett Co-operative Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks.\nThe Federal Home Loan Banks provide central credit facilities primarily for member institutions. Members of a Federal Home Loan Bank are\nrequired to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in their Federal Home Loan Bank. Everett Co-operative Bank complied with this requirement\nat December 31, 2022. Based on redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, the stock has no quoted market value and is\ncarried at cost. The Company reviews its investment in capital stock of the FHLB for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost\nbasis in the FHLB stock. At December 31, 2022, no impairment had been recognized.\nHolding Company Regulation\nECB Bancorp is a bank holding company within the meaning of Bank Holding Company of 1956, as amended. As such, ECB Bancorp is\nregistered with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to bank\nholding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over ECB Bancorp and its non-bank subsidiaries. Among\nother things, this authority permits the\n30\nFederal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to Everett Co-operative Bank.\nA bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more\nthan 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for\nactivities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident\nthereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i)\nmaking or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary,\ninvestment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to\npromote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank\nholding companies.\nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including being “well\ncapitalized” and “well managed,” to opt to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities\nthan previously permitted. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. ECB Bancorp is not a financial holding\ncompany.\nBank holding companies with less than $3 billion in consolidated assets are exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements\nunless the Federal Reserve Board determines otherwise in particular cases.\nBy law, holding companies, including bank holding companies, must act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions\nby providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.\nThe Federal Reserve Board has issued supervisory policies regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common\nstock by bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out\nof current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital\nneeds, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital\ndistributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of capital distributions previously\npaid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the\ncompany’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank\nbecomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff\nbefore redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if\nthe repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, at the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding\ncompared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of\nECB Bancorp to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.\nMassachusetts Holding Company Regulation. Under Massachusetts banking laws, a company owning or controlling two or more banking\ninstitutions, including a cooperative bank, is regulated by the Commissioner as a bank holding company. Each such bank holding company: (i)\nmust obtain the approval of the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation before engaging in certain transactions, such as the acquisition of\nmore than 5% of the voting stock of another banking institution; (ii) must register, and file reports, with the Commissioner; and (iii) is subject to\nexamination by the Commissioner. ECB Bancorp would become a bank holding company regulated by the Commissioner if it acquires a second\nbanking institution and holds and operates it separately from Everett Co-operative Bank.\nChange in Control Regulations\nUnder the Change in Bank Control Act, no person or group of persons may acquire “control” of a bank holding company, such as ECB\nBancorp, unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed\nacquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects\nof the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal\n31\nlaw, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner\nof the election of a majority of the institution’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power, directly or indirectly,\nto exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution. There is a presumption of control upon the acquisition of\n10% or more of a class of voting stock if the holding company involved has its shares registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or, if\nthe holding company involved does not have its shares registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, if no other persons will own, control\nor hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting security after the acquisition.\nFederal Securities Laws\nThe common stock of ECB Bancorp is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ECB Bancorp is subject to the\ninformation, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and\nauditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures\npursuant to the securities laws. We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document\nsuch policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nECB Bancorp is an emerging growth company. For as long as it continues to be an emerging growth company, it may choose to take\nadvantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to public companies. These exemptions include, but are not limited to,\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the\nrequirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not\npreviously approved. As an emerging growth company, ECB Bancorp also is not subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,\nwhich would require that our independent auditors audit our internal control over financial reporting. We have also elected to use the extended\ntransition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are\nmade applicable to private companies. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company.\nECB Bancorp will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth\nanniversary of the completion of the conversion and offering; (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.235 billion (adjusted\nfor inflation) or more; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt\nsecurities; or (iv) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million at the\nend of the second quarter of that fiscal year. We expect to lose our status as an emerging growth company effective December 31, 2027, which is\nthe end of the fifth year after the completion date of the conversion and offering.\n32\nTAXATION\nFederal Taxation\nGeneral. ECB Bancorp and Everett Co-operative Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other\ncorporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal\nincome tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to ECB Bancorp and Everett Co-operative Bank.\nMethod of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Everett Co-operative Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the\naccrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal income tax returns.\nAlternative Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable\nincome plus certain tax preferences, less an exemption amount, referred to as “alternative minimum taxable income.” The alternative minimum\ntax is payable to the extent tax computed this way exceeds tax computed by applying the regular tax rates to regular taxable income. Net\noperating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax\nmay be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed the alternative minimum tax for income\ngenerated after January 1, 2018. At December 31, 2022, Everett Co-operative Bank had no minimum tax credit carryovers.\nNet Operating Loss Carryovers. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generally, a financial institution may carry federal net operating\nlosses forward indefinitely. At December 31, 2022, Everett Co-operative Bank had no federal net operating loss carryforwards.\nCharitable Contribution Carryovers.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had a charitable contribution carryover of $2,412,000 which expires on December 31, 2027.\nCapital Loss Carryovers. A corporation cannot recognize capital losses in excess of capital gains generated. Generally, a financial\ninstitution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the succeeding five taxable years. Any capital loss\ncarryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to which it is carried. As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses\nfor the year to which it is carried and is used to offset any capital gains. Any undeducted loss remaining after the five-year carryover period is not\ndeductible. At December 31, 2022, Everett Co-operative Bank had no capital loss carryovers.\nCorporate Dividends. ECB Bancorp may generally exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from Everett Co-operative Bank\nas a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.\nAudit of Tax Returns. Everett Co-operative Bank’s federal income tax returns have not been audited in the most recent five-year period.\nState Taxation\nFinancial institutions in Massachusetts file combined income tax returns with affiliated companies that are not security corporations. The\nMassachusetts excise tax rate for cooperative banks is currently 9.0% of federal taxable income, adjusted for certain items. Taxable income\nincludes gross income as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, plus interest from bonds, notes and evidences of indebtedness of any state,\nincluding Massachusetts, less deductions, but not the credits, allowable under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, except for those\ndeductions relating to dividends received and income or franchise taxes imposed by a state or political subdivision. Carryforwards and carrybacks\nof net operating losses and capital losses are not allowed. Everett Co-operative Bank’s state tax returns, as well as those of its subsidiaries, have\nnot been audited in the most recent five-year period.\n33\nA financial institution or business corporation is generally entitled to special tax treatment as a “security corporation” under Massachusetts\nlaw provided that: (a) its activities are limited to buying, selling, dealing in or holding securities on its own behalf and not as a broker; and (b) it\nhas applied for, and received, classification as a “security corporation” by the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket, Holder and Dividend Information. The Company’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol\n“ECBK.” The approximate number of holders of record of ECB Bancorp common stock as of March 27, 2023, was 419. Certain shares of ECB\nBancorp are held in “nominee” or “street” name and accordingly, the number of beneficial owners of such shares is not known or included in the\nforegoing number.\nECB Bancorp does not currently pay cash dividends on its common stock. Dividend payments by ECB Bancorp are dependent, in part, on\ndividends it receives from Everett Co-operative Bank, because ECB Bancorp has no source of income other than dividends from Everett Co-\noperative Bank, earnings from the investment of proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock in the stock offering which closed in July 2022\nretained by ECB Bancorp and interest payments with respect to our loan to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan. See “Item 1. Business—\nSupervision and Regulation—Federal Banking Regulation—Capital Distributions.”\nThe Federal Reserve Board has issued supervisory policies providing that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if\nour prospective rate of earnings retention is consistent with our capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Federal Reserve Board\nguidance also provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the holding\ncompany’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the\nholding company’s overall rate or earnings retention is inconsistent with its capital needs and overall financial condition. In addition, Everett Co-\noperative Bank’s ability to pay dividends will be limited if it does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules, which may\nlimit our ability to pay dividends to shareholders. No assurances can be given that any dividends will be paid or that, if paid, will not be reduced\nor eliminated in the future. Special cash dividends, stock dividends or returns of capital, to the extent permitted by regulations and policies of the\nFederal Reserve Board and the Commissioner, may be paid in addition to, or in lieu of, regular cash dividends.\nOther than its Employee Stock Ownership Plan, ECB Bancorp does not have any equity compensation plans that were not approved by\nshareholders. ECB Bancorp currently has no other equity compensation plans.\nReport of Offering of Securities and Use of Proceeds Therefrom. Not applicable.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe Company did not purchase any shares of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2022. Under current Federal Reserve\nBoard regulations, the Company may not repurchase shares of its common stock during the first year following the Company’s initial public\noffering, except to fund shareholder-approved equity benefit plans or, with prior regulatory approval, when extraordinary circumstances exist.\nITEM 6. [Reserved]\n36\nITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis reflects our financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your\nunderstanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from the audited financial\nstatements, which appear beginning on page 50 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from\noperations, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate and multifamily loans, construction and land loans and home\nequity lines of credit. At December 31, 2022, $355.4 million, or 39.8%, of our total loan portfolio was comprised of one- to four-family residential\nreal estate loans, $242.0 million, or 27.1%, of our total loan portfolio was comprised of multifamily real estate loans, $156.2 million, or 17.5%, of\nour total loan portfolio was comprised of commercial real estate loans, $107.3 million, or 12.0%, of our total loan portfolio was comprised of\nconstruction loans and $27.8 million, or 3.1%, of our total loan portfolio was comprised of home equity lines of credit and loans. We also invest\nin securities, consisting primarily of U.S. government and federal agency obligations, mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds. We offer a\nvariety of deposit accounts, including certificate of deposit accounts, IRAs, money market accounts, savings accounts and interest-bearing and\nnoninterest-bearing checking accounts. We historically have utilized advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the “FHLB”) to\nfund our operations and we had $174.0 million of FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2022. Additionally, in recent years, we have also\naccepted brokered deposits as a non-retail funding source to fund our operations. At December 31, 2022 we had $100.8 million of brokered\ndeposits.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had net income of $2.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively. Our 2022 net income\nwas affected by an after-tax charge of $2.3 million related to a charitable contribution to the Everett Co-operative Bank Charitable Foundation.\nOur 2021 net income was affected by an after-tax charge of $1.4 million related to our freezing of and withdrawal from a defined benefit plan. Our\ncurrent business strategy includes continuing to focus on originating and growing our commercial real estate, multifamily real estate and\nconstruction loan portfolios and the origination of one- to four-family residential real estate loans.\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we\nearn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our\nprovision for loan losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest income currently consists primarily of fees and service\ncharges, gains on sales of loans and income on bank-owned life insurance. Noninterest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to\nsalary and employee benefits and director fees, occupancy and equipment, data processing, advertising, professional fees, federal deposit\ninsurance assessments, charitable contributions and other general and administrative expenses.\nOur results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market\ninterest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur principal objective is to build long-term value for our shareholders by operating a profitable community-oriented financial institution\ndedicated to meeting the banking needs of our customers. Highlights of our current business strategy include:\n• Continuing to focus on enhancing our commercial real estate and multifamily lending. In order to increase the yield on our loan\nportfolio and reduce the term to maturity of our loan portfolio, we intend to continue our focus on growing the originations of commercial\nreal estate loans and multifamily loans while maintaining what we believe are prudent underwriting standards and we expect that these loan\ncategories will comprise a greater percentage of our total loan portfolio. In order to execute on this strategy, in January 2022 we hired a\nnew Chief Lending Officer as well as some additional commercial lending and credit analyst personnel throughout the year. The capital\nraised in the offering has and will continue to allow us to increase our commercial lending capacity by enabling us to originate and retain\nall or a greater portion of loans that we historically participated out to other local institutions.\n37\nGiven that our regulatory loans to one borrower limits have increased with our increase in capital, we have revised our lending policies and\nloans to one borrower limitations to increase our lending limits and the type and size of loans we choose to originate and hold in our\nportfolio. Our commercial real estate and multifamily loan portfolios increased to $156.2 million and $242.0 million, respectively, at\nDecember 31, 2022 from $100.0 million and $59.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021.\n• Reduced focus on one- to four-family residential real estate lending. We have been, and will continue to be, a one- to four-family\nresidential real estate lender for borrowers in our market area and such lending will remain a core focus, but we expect that our lending\nstrategy will result in a decrease to one-to-four family residential loans as a percentage of our total loan portfolio as we increase our focus\non commercial real estate and multifamily lending. As of December 31, 2022, $355.4 million, or 39.8%, of our total loan portfolio,\nconsisted of one- to four-family residential real estate loans and at that date an additional $27.8 million, or 3.1%, of our total loan portfolio,\nconsisted of home equity lines of credit and loans. We expect that one- to four-family residential real estate lending will remain one of our\nprimary lending activities.\n• Maintaining our strong asset quality through prudent loan underwriting. As we seek to grow our loan portfolio, we intend to maintain\nprudent loan underwriting and credit monitoring processes. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, non-performing assets totaled $656,000 and\n$982,000, respectively, which represented 0.06% and 0.15% of total assets at those dates, respectively.\n• Continuing to attract and retain customers in our market area and build our “core” deposits consisting of interest-bearing and\nnoninterest-bearing checking, savings and money market accounts. Our strategy to enhance and grow our commercial real estate lending\nin a diligent and orderly manner is also designed to encourage relationship banking and increase our core deposits, including noninterest-\nbearing transaction accounts, and decrease our dependence on certificates of deposit. We plan to leverage our increased focus on\ncommercial real estate and commercial lending efforts to also increase our opportunities to develop commercial business deposit\nrelationships. Additionally, we believe the recent hire of our Senior Vice President of Retail Operations, who brings 35 years of banking\nexperience to our retail sales and administrative team, will be invaluable to the implementation of the added product delivery channels and\ntechnological services such as additional electronic and mobile banking applications, which we believe will increase our core deposits.\n• Remaining a community-oriented institution and relying on high quality service to maintain and build a loyal local customer base. We\nwere established in 1890 and have been operating continuously in and around Everett, Massachusetts since that time. By using our\nrecognized brand name and the goodwill developed over years of providing timely, efficient banking services, we believe we have been\nable to attract a solid base of local retail customers on which to continue to build our banking business. Additionally, we believe that the\nestablishment and funding of the charitable foundation will further promote our relationships and exposure in our market area through our\nsupport of charitable organizations operating in our local community now and in the future.\n• Expanding our banking franchise as opportunities arise through de novo branching and/or branch acquisitions. We currently operate\nfrom our two full-service banking offices. We believe there are branch expansion opportunities that exist within our primary market area.\nWe intend to evaluate branch expansion opportunities, including through establishing one or more de novo branches and/or branch\nacquisitions as such opportunities arise.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which\nare prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of\nincome and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be significant accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions\nthat we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results\nmay differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying\nvalue of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.\n38\nThe JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an\n“emerging growth company” we have elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting\npronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our\nconsolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised\naccounting standards.\nThe following represent our significant accounting policies:\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a reserve for estimated probable credit losses on individually evaluated loans\ndetermined to be impaired as well as estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Actual credit losses, net of recoveries, are\ndeducted from the allowance for loan losses. Loans are charged off when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely.\nSubsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for loan losses. A provision for loan losses, which is a charge against earnings, is\nrecorded to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that, in management’s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable losses in the loan\nportfolio. Management’s evaluation process used to determine the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is subject to the use of\nestimates, assumptions, and judgment. The evaluation process involves gathering and interpreting many qualitative and quantitative factors which\ncould affect probable credit losses. Because interpretation and analysis involves judgment, current economic or business conditions can change,\nand future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses and therefore the appropriateness of the\nallowance for loan losses could change significantly.\nThe allocation methodology applied by ECB Bancorp is designed to assess the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and\nincludes allocations for specifically identified impaired loans and loss factor allocations for all remaining loans, with a component primarily based\non historical loss rates and a component primarily based on other qualitative factors. The methodology includes evaluation and consideration of\nseveral factors, such as, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical\nloan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair\nvalue of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses.\nWhile management uses the best information available to make its evaluation, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are\nsignificant changes in economic conditions or circumstances underlying the collectability of loans. Because each of the criteria used is subject to\nchange, the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan\nlosses in any particular loan category. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio. Management\nbelieves the allowance for loan losses was adequate at December 31, 2022. The allowance analysis is reviewed by the board of directors on a\nquarterly basis in compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan\nlosses. As a result of such reviews, we may choose to adjust our allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved\nin the process of establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is the responsibility of ECB Bancorp, Inc. and any increase or decrease\nin the allowance is the responsibility of management.\nAs noted above, we consider a number of variables in our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, with one of the more\nsignificant variables being delinquency levels in the various segments of our loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\n$71,000 and $174,000 of our allowance for loan losses reflects the risk relative to portfolio delinquency. Based on our model, if all segments of\nour loan portfolio experienced delinquency rates of 5% of the outstanding balance of loans, our allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2022\nwould have increased by $4.4 million to $11.6 million, holding all other variables constant.\nThrough December 31, 2022 we followed the incurred loss methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses. We adopted the\nCurrent Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology on January 1, 2023. This methodology replaces the existing incurred loss and impairment\nmethodology in current GAAP with a methodology referred to as CECL. This methodology reflects expected credit losses and requires\nconsideration of historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Financial\ninstitutions will now use forward-looking information to estimate the expected credit loss on a loan at the time of origination. Credit losses on\navailable-for-sale debt securities will be measured in a manner similar to current GAAP but will be recognized through an\n39\nallowance rather than as a direct writedown. Upon the adoption of the change in methodology, the change from the incurred loss methodology to\nthe CECL methodology will be recognized through an adjustment to retained earnings. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact the\nadoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements, which is expected to be significant. Management is still finalizing the\nanalysis of its current expected credit loss methodology and has not yet estimated the impact that this guidance will have on our allowance for\nloan losses.\nIncome Taxes. We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and\nliabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable\nincome in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation\nallowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in\nevaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments may require us to make projections of\nfuture taxable income and/or to carryback to taxable income in prior years. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax\nassets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated\nfuture taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nSecurities Valuation and Impairment. We classify our investments in debt securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale.\nSecurities classified as held-to maturity are recorded at cost or amortized cost. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. We obtain our\nfair values from one or more third-party services. This service’s fair value calculations are based on quoted market prices when such prices are\navailable. If quoted market prices are not available, estimates of fair value are computed using a variety of techniques, including extrapolation\nfrom the quoted prices of similar instruments or recent trades for thinly traded securities, fundamental analysis, or through obtaining purchase\nquotes. Due to the subjective nature of the valuation process, it is possible that the actual fair values of these investments could differ from the\nestimated amounts, thereby affecting our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For any debt security with a fair value less than\nits amortized cost basis, we will determine whether we have the intent to sell the debt security or whether it is more likely than not we will be\nrequired to sell the debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either condition is met, the Company will recognize a full\nimpairment charge to earnings. For all other debt securities that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired and do not meet either condition,\nthe credit loss portion of impairment will be recognized in earnings as realized losses. The other-than-temporary impairment related to all other\nfactors will be recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). We also consider how long a security has been in a loss position in determining if it\nis other than temporarily impaired. Management also assesses the nature of the unrealized losses taking into consideration factors such as changes\nin risk-free interest rates, general credit spread widening, market supply and demand, creditworthiness of the issuer, and quality of the underlying\ncollateral.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021\nTotal Assets. Total assets increased $398.0 million, or 59.7%, to $1.06 billion at December 31, 2022 from $666.5 million at December 31,\n2021. The increase was primarily the result of increases in loans, held-to-maturity securities, cash and cash equivalents and Federal Home Loan\nBank stock.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased $9.1 million, or 17.1%, to $62.1 million at December 31, 2022 from\n$53.0 million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in proceeds from the offering, increases in deposits and FHLB advances,\npartially offset by funding loan growth and purchases of investment securities held-to-maturity.\nSecurities Held-To-Maturity. Securities held-to-maturity increased $12.0 million, or 18.3%, to $77.6 million at December 31, 2022 from\n$65.6 million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to purchases of securities of $22.6 million partially offset by principal repayments of $10.4\nmillion.\nLoans. Loans increased $368.5 million, or 71.3%, to $885.7 million at December 31, 2022 from $517.1 million at December 31, 2021. The\nlargest increases in our loan portfolio were in the multi-family real estate loans, one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial real\nestate loans and construction loans. Multi-family real estate loans\n40\nincreased $182.4 million, or 306.5%, from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022, one- to four- family residential real estate loans increased\n$95.7 million, or 36.9%, from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022, commercial real estate loans increased $56.3 million, or 56.3%, to\n$156.2 million at December 31, 2022 from $100.0 million at December 31, 2021 and construction loans increased $36.6 million, or 51.9%, from\n$70.7 million at December 31, 2021 to $107.3 million at December 31, 2022. The increase in these loan portfolios reflects our strategy to grow the\nbalance sheet by continuing to diversify into higher-yielding commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans to improve net margins and\nmanage interest rate risk. In addition, to help manage interest rate risk and generate non-interest income, we sell one- to four-family residential\nmortgage loans into the secondary market on a servicing-released basis. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold $5.8 million in loans\nand recognized gains of $84,000.\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock. The Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) is a cooperative bank that provides services to its member\nbanking institutions. The primary reason for our membership in the FHLB is to gain access to a reliable source of wholesale funding and as a tool\nto manage interest rate risk. The purchase of stock in the FHLB is a requirement for a member to gain access to funding. We purchase and/or are\nsubject to redemption of FHLB stock proportional to the volume of funding received and view the holdings as a necessary long-term investment\nfor the purpose of balance sheet liquidity and not for investment return. We held an investment in FHLB stock of $7.3 million and $1.1 million at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amount of stock we are required to purchase is in proportion to our FHLB borrowings and level of\ntotal assets. Accordingly, the increase in the FHLB stock is due to increased borrowing.\nBank-owned Life Insurance. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to help offset the costs of our employee benefit plan obligations.\nBank-owned life insurance also generally provides noninterest income that is nontaxable. Bank-owned life insurance decreased $68,000, or 0.5%,\nto $14.1 million at December 31, 2022 from $14.1 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease was due to a reduction of our cash surrender value\nof $466,000 related to policy claims due to the death of an insured individual. Partially offsetting the decrease to cash surrender value, we\nrecognized $398,000 from the increase in cash surrender value of our bank-owned life insurance portfolio during the year ended December 31,\n2022.\nDeposits. Deposits increased $146.4 million, or 25.6%, to $718.1 million at December 31, 2022 from $571.8 million at December 31, 2021.\nCore deposits (defined as all deposits other than certificates of deposit and brokered deposits) increased $53.4 million, or 15.5%, to $398.3 million\nat December 31, 2022 from $344.9 million at December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily a result of a $98.3 million, or 196.4%, increase in\nsavings accounts to $148.4 million at December 31, 2022 from $50.0 million at December 31, 2021 partially offset by a $47.1 million, or 25.7%,\ndecrease in money market accounts to $136.1 million at December 31, 2022 from $183.2 million at December 31, 2021. Certificates of deposit\nincreased $93.0 million, or 41.0%, to $319.8 million at December 31, 2022 from $226.8 million at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022\nand 2021, we had $100.8 million and $19.9 million of brokered deposits, respectively.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Advances. Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $165.0 million, or 1,833.3%, to $174.0\nmillion at December 31, 2022 from $9.0 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in FHLB advances was utilized to support loan growth\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022.\nShareholders' Equity. Total shareholders' equity increased $85.5 million, or 110.6%, to $162.7 million at December 31, 2022 from $77.3\nmillion at December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to net offering proceeds received in connection with the conversion offering which\nclosed in July 2022 of $79.2 million, $2.6 million in equity that was contributed to the Everett Co-operative Bank Charitable Foundation, and net\nincome of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021\nNet Income. Net income was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net income of $4.0 million for the year\nended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 32.7%. The decrease was primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in noninterest\nexpense, offset in part by a $2.4 million increase in net interest and dividend income after provision for loan losses.\n41\nInterest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $6.8 million, or 30.3%, to $29.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 from $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a $5.6 million increase in interest and fees on\nloans. The increase in interest and fees on loans was driven by an increase of $146.4 million in the average balance of the loan portfolio to $643.3\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $496.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a decrease in the\nyield by 10 basis points from 4.29% during the year ended December 31, 2021 to 4.19% during the year ended December 31, 2022. The yield for\nthe year ended December 31, 2021 benefited from $653,000 in loan prepayment penalties as well as $332,000 in PPP loan fee income as\ncompared to $66,000 in prepayment penalties and $135,000 in PPP loan fee income recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nInterest and dividends on securities increased $476,000, or 47.0% from $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $1.5 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was driven by an increase in the yield of investment securities held-to-maturity and\navailable-for-sale of 36 basis points from 1.49% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 1.85% for the year ended December 31, 2022 as well as\nan increase in the average balance of $8.5 million from $66.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 to $75.0 million during the year\nended December 31, 2022. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized interest and dividends of $101,000 on cost\nmethod investments as compared to interest and dividends of $24,000 recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOther interest income increased $671,000, or 1,525% from $44,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $715,000 for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. This increase was due to the yield on short term investments increasing by 1.61% from 0.10% for the year ended December\n31, 2021 to 1.71% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $153.6 million, to $760.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $606.7 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2021. The yield on interest earning-assets increased by 14 basis points to 3.82% for the year ended December 31,\n2022 from 3.68% for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $1.8 million, or 49.8%, to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $3.7\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest expense on deposit accounts increased $1.0 million, or 28.8%, to $4.6 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022 from $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to an increase in the weighted average rate on interest-\nbearing deposits to 0.85% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 0.77% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as an increase in the\naverage balance of interest-bearing deposits of $77.9 million, or 16.9% to $538.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $460.2\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nInterest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased $813,000, or 602.2%, to $948,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022\nfrom $135,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The average balance of Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased $27.5 million, or\n222.5%, to $39.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The average balance\nincreased as we utilized advances to fund loan growth. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the weighted average cost of Federal Home Loan\nAdvances was 2.38%, as compared to 1.09% for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nNet Interest and Dividend Income. Net interest and dividend income increased $4.9 million, or 26.4%, to $23.6 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 from $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a $153.6 million increase in the average balance\nof interest-earning assets during the year ended December 31, 2022, together with an increase in the net interest margin to 3.10% for the year\nended December 31, 2022 from 3.08% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The improvement in the net interest margin was largely due to the\ninterest earning asset growth that was funded with the zero cost capital that was raised in the stock offering. The interest rate spread declined by\n0.03% to 2.87% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 2.90% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the interest rate spread\nwas due to an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities that exceeded the increase in the yield on interest earning assets.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Based on management’s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, a provision of $2.9 million\nwas recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a provision of $360,000 for\n42\nthe year ended December 31, 2021. The $2.6 million, or 716.7%, increase in the provision was primarily due to loan portfolio growth.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income increased $179,000, or 14.6%, to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $1.2\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was driven by $430,000 of gains recognized into income from life insurance policy\ndeath benefits. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of $362,000 in net gains on sales of loans due to the current interest rate\nenvironment and lower originations of saleable loans. The table below sets forth our noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2022\nand 2021:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n2022 2021 Amount Percent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCustomer service fees $ 446 $ 393 $ 53 13.5 %\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance 828 355 473 133.2\nNet gain on sales of loans 84 446 (362) (81.2)\nOther 43 28 15 53.6\nTotal noninterest income $ 1,401 $ 1,222 $ 179 14.6 %\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $4.5 million, or 32.0%, to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from\n$14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in charitable contributions to $3.3 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 from $54,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 resulting from a $3.2 million contribution to the Everett\nCo-operative Bank Charitable Foundation, representing 260,000 shares of our common stock and $600,000 in cash contributed as part of our\ninitial public offering. Professional fees and other expenses increased by $364,000, or 75.5%, and $388,000, or 36.7%, respectively, primarily due\nto operating a publicly traded company and implementing our growth strategy. FDIC assessments increased $69,000, or 44.2%. This increase was\nprimarily due to asset growth. We expect FDIC assessment costs to continue to increase as the FDIC has increased assessment rates for all banks\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2023. The table below sets forth our noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n2022 2021 Amount Percent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 9,928 $ 9,599 $ 329 3.4 %\nDirector Compensation 429 430 (1) (0.3)\nOccupancy and equipment 766 721 45 6.2\nData processing 704 684 20 2.9\nComputer software and licensing fees 247 253 (6) (2.4)\nAdvertising and promotions 752 648 104 16.0\nProfessional fees 846 482 364 75.5\nFDIC Assessment 225 156 69 44.2\nCharitable contributions 3,256 54 3,202 5,929.6\nOther expense 1,446 1,058 388 36.7\nTotal noninterest expense\n$ 18,599 $ 14,085 $ 4,514 32.0 %\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense decreased $653,000, or 45.7%, to $776,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $1.4\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The effective tax rate was 22.2% and 26.1% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by increased non-taxable income from bank-owned life insurance in 2022 as\ncompared to 2021.\n43\nAverage Balances and Yields. The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information\nfor the years indicated. Average balances are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans are included in average balances only. Average yields\ninclude the effect of deferred costs and fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense.\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nAverage Average\nOutstanding Outstanding\nBalance Interest Yield/ Rate(5) Balance Interest Yield/ Rate(5)\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest-earning assets:\nTotal loans $ 643,298 $ 26,946 4.19 % $ 496,915 $ 21,319 4.29 %\nSecurities (1) 74,950 1,387 1.85 66,420 988 1.49\nShort term investments 41,831 713 1.71 43,375 44 0.10\nInterest bearing time deposits 238 2 0.71 — — —\nTotal interest-earning assets 760,317 29,048 3.82 % 606,710 22,351 3.68 %\nNon-interest-earning assets 27,486 23,140\nTotal assets $ 787,803 $ 629,850\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nRegular savings accounts $ 70,106 $ 461 0.66 % $ 47,042 $ 30 0.06 %\nChecking accounts 35,900 29 0.08 25,837 59 0.23\nMoney market accounts 177,549 864 0.49 163,933 555 0.34\nCertificates of deposit 254,543 3,212 1.26 223,366 2,902 1.30\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 538,098 4,566 0.85 460,178 3,546 0.77\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances 39,859 948 2.38 12,359 135 1.09\nOther borrowings 27 1 3.70 — — —\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 577,984 5,515 0.95 % 472,537 3,681 0.78 %\nNon-interest-bearing demand deposits 86,646 76,290\nNon-interest-bearing liabilities 8,344 5,309\nTotal liabilities 672,974 554,136\nShareholders' Equity 114,829 75,714\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 787,803 $ 629,850\nNet interest income $ 23,533 $ 18,670\nNet interest rate spread (2) 2.87 % 2.90 %\nNet interest-earning assets (3) $ 182,333 $ 134,173\nNet interest margin (4) 3.10 % 3.08 %\nAverage interest-earning assets to interest-\nbearing liabilities 131.55 % 128.39 %\n(1) Excludes FHLB stock dividends of $52,000 and $22,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and $49,000 and $2,000 of interest and dividends on\ncost method investments recorded within other assets for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n(2) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate of interest-bearing liabilities.\n(3) Net interest-earning assets represent total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.\n(4) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.\n44\nRate/Volume Analysis. The following tables present the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods\nindicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior period volume). The volume\ncolumn shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of\nthe prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated\nproportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. There were no out-of-period items or adjustments required to be\nexcluded from the table below.\nYears Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021\nTotal\nIncrease (Decrease) Due to Increase\nVolume Rate (Decrease)\n(In thousands)\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans $ 6,143 $ (516) $ 5,627\nSecurities 138 261 399\nShort term investments (2) 671 669\nInterest bearing time deposits 2 - 2\nTotal interest-earning assets $ 6,281 $ 416 $ 6,697\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nInterest-bearing demand deposits $ 17 $ (47) $ (30)\nRegular savings and other deposits 22 409 431\nMoney market deposits 49 260 309\nCertificates of deposit 395 (85) 310\nTotal deposits 483 537 1,020\nAdvances from the Federal Home Loan Bank 532 281 813\nOther interest-bearing liabilities 1 - 1\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities $ 1,016 $ 818 $ 1,834\nChange in net interest income $ 5,265 $ (402) $ 4,863\nManagement of Market Risk\nGeneral. Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and\nliabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the\nexposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our chief financial officer is responsible for\nevaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business\nstrategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines\napproved by our board of directors. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity\nto changing interest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this\nrisk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors.\nWe have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates.\nWe have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk:\n• maintaining capital levels that exceed the thresholds for well-capitalized status under federal regulations;\n• maintaining a prudent level of liquidity;\n• growing our volume of core deposit accounts;\n• managing our investment securities portfolio to maintain a prudent balance between enhancing profitability and protecting the\nbalance sheet against sensitivity to changes in interest rates;\n• managing our utilization of wholesale funding with borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank and brokered deposits in a\nprudent manner; and\n45\n• continuing to diversify our loan portfolio by adding more commercial-related loans, which typically have shorter maturities\nand/or balloon payments.\nBy following these strategies, we believe that we are better positioned to react to increases and decreases in market interest rates.\nWe have not engaged in hedging activities, such as engaging in swaps, futures or options. We may consider these activities in the future.\nNet Interest Income. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through a net interest income model. Net interest income is the\ndifference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-\nbearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a 12-month period. We then calculate\nwhat the net interest income would be for the same period under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases or\ndecreases instantaneously by various basis point increments, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts\nin the yield curve. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase in interest rates from\n3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100-basis point increase in the “Change in Interest Rates” column below.\nThe table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2022, the calculation of the estimated changes in our net interest income that would result\nfrom the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.\nAs of December 31, 2022\nChange in Interest Rates (basis Net Interest Income Year 1\npoints) (1) Forecast Year 1 Change from Level\n(Dollars in thousands)\n400 21,237 -18.9%\n300 22,448 -14.3%\n200 23,657 -9.7%\n100 24,984 -4.6%\nLevel 26,201 0.0%\n-100 26,746 2.1%\n-200 26,770 2.2%\n-300 26,983 3.0%\n-400 27,446 4.8%\n____________________\n1. Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.\nThe tables above indicate that at December 31, 2022, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we\nwould experience a decrease in net interest income of 9.7%, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we\nwould experience a 2.2% increase in net interest income.\nEconomic Value of Equity. We also compute amounts by which the net present value of our assets and liabilities (economic value of\nequity or “EVE”) would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. This model uses a discounted cash flow\nanalysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. The model estimates the economic\nvalue of each type of asset, liability and off-balance sheet contract under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases\ninstantaneously by 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis point increments or decreases instantaneously by 100 basis point increments, with changes in\ninterest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve.\n46\nThe table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2022, the calculation of the estimated changes in our EVE that would result from the\ndesignated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.\nAs of December 31, 2022\nEstimated Increase (Decrease) in EVE EVE as a Percentage of Present Value of Assets (3)\nChange in Interest Increase (Decrease)\nRates (basis points) (1) Estimated EVE (2) Amount Percent EVE Ratio (4) (basis points)\n(Dollars in thousands)\n400 87,366 (44,808) -33.9% 9.6% (340)\n300 97,712 (34,462) -26.1% 10.4% (255)\n200 108,705 (23,469) -17.8% 11.3% (169)\n100 121,322 (10,852) -8.2% 12.2% (75)\n— 132,174 0 0.0% 13.0% 0\n-100 138,747 6,573 5.0% 13.3% 30\n-200 141,834 9,660 7.3% 13.2% 28\n-300 143,814 11,640 8.8% 13.1% 14\n-400 136,912 4,738 3.6% 12.3% (71)\n(1) Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.\n(2) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts.\n(3) Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets.\n(4) EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets.\nThe table above indicates that at December 31, 2022, in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we\nwould experience a 17.8% decrease in EVE, and in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would experience a\n7.3% increase in EVE.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require\nmaking certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates.\nThe net interest income and net economic value tables presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities\nexisting at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is\nreflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the tables\nprovide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a\nprecise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates, and actual results may differ.\nInterest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, increases in market interest rates can\ndecrease the fair values of our loans but increase the fair value of deposits and borrowings.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed\nto meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary sources\nof funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We are also able to\nborrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding advances of $174.0 million from the Federal\nHome Loan Bank. At December 31, 2022, we had unused borrowing capacity of $84.8 million with the Federal Home Loan Bank and $10.0\nmillion with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank.\nWhile maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments\nare greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments.\nThe levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, and investing activities during any given period.\nOur cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing\nactivities.\n47\nAt December 31, 2022, we had $43.9 million in loan commitments outstanding. In addition to commitments to originate and purchase\nloans, we had $80.2 million in unused lines of credit to borrowers and $72.4 million in unadvanced construction loans.\nCertificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2022 totaled $183.4 million, or 25.5%, of total deposits. If these deposits do\nnot remain with us, we may be required to seek other sources of funds, including brokered deposits and FHLB advances. Depending on market\nconditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due\non or before December 31, 2023, or on our savings and money market accounts.\nWe believe, however, based on historical experience and current market interest rates that we will retain upon maturity a large portion of\nour certificates of deposit with maturities of one year or less as of December 31, 2022.\nOur primary investing activity is originating loans. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we originated and purchased\n$557.5 million and $254.6 million of loans, respectively.\nFinancing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts, as well as both FHLB advances and brokered deposits. We\nexperienced net increases in deposits of $146.4 million and $80.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Deposit\nflows are affected primarily by the overall level of interest rates and the interest rates and products offered by us and our competitors. At\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the level of brokered time deposits was $100.8 million and $19.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and\n2021 the level of FHLB advances was $174.0 million and $9.0 million, respectively.\nFor additional information, see the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 included as part\nof the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this 10-K.\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will\nhave sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we\nanticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained.\nAt December 31, 2022, Everett Co-operative Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements, and was categorized as well-\ncapitalized at that date. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification of well-capitalized status that\nwould change our category. See Note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nCommitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such\nas commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a\nsignificant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit\npolicies and approval process accorded to loans we make. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding commitments to originate and purchase\nloans of $43.9 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current lending commitments. Time deposits that\nare scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2022 totaled $183.4 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of\nthese time deposits will be retained. However, if a substantial portion of these time deposits is not retained, we may utilize advances from the\nFederal Home Loan Bank, brokered deposits or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of\ninterest expense.\nContractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include\ndata processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities.\n48\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements that may affect our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Price\nThe consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this 10-K have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which\nrequires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative\npurchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs.\nUnlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest\nrates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move\nin the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nITEM 7A.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not\nrequired to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to\nobtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,\nand performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\nB\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 N\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 N\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 LLC\n/s/ Baker Newman & Noyes

2022\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nCONVERSION\nOn March 9, 2022, the Board of Directors of Everett Co-operative Bank (\"the Bank\") adopted a Plan of Conversion under which the Bank\nwould convert from a Massachusetts mutual co-operative bank into a Massachusetts stock co-operative bank and become the wholly owned\nsubsidiary of a newly chartered stock holding company, ECB Bancorp, Inc. (the “Holding Company”). The Plan of Conversion received all of the\napprovals of various regulatory agencies and the Plan of Conversion was approved by the required vote of more than two-thirds of the Bank’s\ndepositors present and voting at a special meeting of depositors held on May 5, 2022. The Bank’s mutual to stock conversion and the Company’s\nstock offering were consummated on July 27, 2022. In the offering, the Company sold 8,915,247 shares of common stock at a per share price of\n$10.00 for gross offering proceeds of $89.2 million. Additionally, the Company contributed 260,000 shares to the Everett Co-operative Bank\nCharitable Foundation (the “Foundation”).\nThe offering costs of issuing the capital stock were deferred and deducted from the proceeds of the offering. Total offering costs that were\ndeducted from the proceeds amounted to $2,567,000. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bank had incurred approximately $0\nand $76,000, respectively, in offering costs that were deferred and capitalized.\nThe Bank has established a Liquidation Account in an amount equal to the net worth of the Bank as of the date of the latest consolidated\nbalance sheet contained in the final prospectus distributed in connection with the conversion and stock offering. The function of the Liquidation\nAccount is to establish a priority on liquidation of the Bank. The Liquidation Account will be maintained by the Bank for the benefit of the\neligible account holders who continue to maintain deposit accounts with the Bank following the conversion. Each eligible account holder shall,\nwith respect to each deposit account, hold a related inchoate interest in a portion of the Liquidation Account balance, in relation to each deposit\naccount balance at the eligibility record date, or to such balance as it may be subsequently reduced, as hereinafter provided. The initial Liquidation\nAccount balance shall not be increased, and shall be subject to downward adjustment to the extent of any downward adjustment of any subaccount\nbalance of any eligible account holder in accordance with the regulations of the Division of Banks of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\nIn the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the Bank (and only in such event), following all liquidation payments to creditors\n(including those to depositors to the extent of their deposit accounts) each eligible account holder shall be entitled to receive a liquidating\ndistribution from the Liquidation Account, in the amount of the then-adjusted subaccount balances for his or her deposit accounts then held,\nbefore any liquidating distribution may be made to any holder of the Bank’s capital stock.\nThe Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on its outstanding capital stock if the effect thereof would cause its regulatory capital to\nbe reduced below the amount required to maintain the Liquidation Account and under FDIC rules and regulations.\n57\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accounting and reporting policies of ECB Bancorp, Inc. (the \"Company\") and its subsidiary conform to accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and predominant practices within the banking industry. The consolidated financial\nstatements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. The significant accounting policies are summarized below to assist the reader in\nbetter understanding the consolidated financial statements and other data contained herein. In the opinion of management, all adjustments\nnecessary for a fair presentation are reflected in these consolidated financial statements, and all adjustments made are of a normal recurring nature.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company include the balances and results of operations of ECB Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly-\nowned subsidiary Everett Co-operative Bank (\"the Bank\") as well as First Everett Securities Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank.\nIntercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates that\nare particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses.\nReclassification\nCertain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items, due from banks and short-term\ninvestments.\nThe Company has historically been required to maintain certain vault cash and/or deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\nHowever, based on the COVID-19 pandemic the Federal Reserve has reduced the reserve requirement ratio to zero percent across all deposit tiers\nas of March 26, 2020.\nSecurities\nThe Company classifies securities at the time of purchase into one of four categories: held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, trading, or equity.\nThese security classifications may be modified after acquisition only under certain specified conditions. In general, debt securities may be\nclassified as held-to-maturity only if the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Trading securities are defined as\nthose bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. All other debt securities must be classified as available-for-sale.\n• Held-to-maturity securities are measured at amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized holding gains and losses are not\nincluded in earnings, or in a separate component of shareholders' equity; they are merely disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements.\n• Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized holding gains and losses are not\nincluded in earnings but are reported in other comprehensive income, net of related tax.\n58\n• Trading and equity securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized holding gains and losses for trading\nand equity securities are included in earnings. The Company had no securities classified as trading or equity securities at December 31,\n2022 and 2021.\nPurchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income, using the interest method, to arrive at periodic interest income at a\nconstant effective yield, thereby reflecting the securities' market yield. Gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and\nare determined using the specific identification method. Such gains and losses are recognized within non-interest income or non-interest expense\nwithin the consolidated statements of income.\nFor any debt security with a fair value less than its amortized cost basis, the Company will determine whether it has the intent to sell the\ndebt security or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. If\neither condition is met, the Company will recognize a full impairment charge to earnings. For all other debt securities that are considered other-\nthan-temporarily impaired and do not meet either condition, the credit loss portion of impairment will be recognized in earnings as realized losses.\nThe other-than-temporary impairment related to all other factors will be recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock\nThe Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (FHLB), is required to maintain an investment in capital stock of the\nFHLB. Based on redemption provisions of the FHLB, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. The Company reviews its\ninvestment in capital stock of the FHLB for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis in the FHLB stock.\nLoans Held-for-Sale\nLoans held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value in the aggregate. Net unrealized losses are recognized through a\nvaluation allowance and recorded in noninterest expense. Fair value is based on committed secondary market prices. No losses have been\nrecorded during 2022 or 2021.\nLoans\nLoans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold until maturity or payoff are reported at their outstanding principal\nbalances adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans, or unamortized premiums\nor discounts on purchased loans.\nInterest on loans is recognized on a simple interest basis.\nLoan origination and commitment fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred, and the net amount is amortized as an adjustment to\nthe related loan’s yield. The Company is amortizing these amounts over the contractual lives of the related loans.\nResidential real estate loans are generally placed on nonaccrual when reaching 90 days past due or in process of foreclosure. All closed-end\nconsumer loans 90 days or more past due and any equity line in the process of foreclosure are placed on nonaccrual status. Secured consumer\nloans are written down to realizable value and unsecured consumer loans are charged off upon reaching 120 or 180 days past due depending on\nthe type of loan. Commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans and leases which are 90 days or more past due are generally placed\non nonaccrual status. When a loan has been placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against current\nincome. A loan can be returned to accrual status when collectability of principal and interest is reasonably assured and the loan has performed for\na period of time, generally six months.\nCash receipts of interest income on impaired loans are credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectability\nof the net carrying amount of the loan. Some or all of the cash receipts of interest income on impaired loans is recognized as interest income if the\nremaining net carrying amount of the loan is deemed to be fully collectible. When recognition of interest income on an impaired loan on a cash\nbasis is appropriate, the amount of income\n59\nthat is recognized is limited to that which would have been accrued on the net carrying amount of the loan at the contractual interest rate. Any cash\ninterest payments received in excess of the limit and not applied to reduce the net carrying amount of the loan are recorded as recoveries of\ncharge-offs until the charge-offs are fully recovered.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) established the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a stimulus\nprogram which grants SBA-guaranteed, forgivable loans to businesses to encourage employee retention by subsidizing payroll and certain other\ncosts during the pandemic. These loans are originated and funded by financial institutions and are an extension of the Small Business\nAdministration’s (SBA) 7(a) loan program. There were no PPP loans originated during 2022. The Bank originated 70 PPP loans totaling\n$6,049,000 and recorded net deferred fees of $237,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021. Origination fees, net of costs, are being\naccreted into interest income over the contractual life of each loan. Included in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021\nwere 2 PPP loans amounting to $121,000 and 48 PPP loans amounting to $3,404,000, respectively, which are classified within commercial loans.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to\nearnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed.\nSubsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nThe allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s periodic review of the\ncollectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the\nborrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently\nsubjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nGeneral Component\nThe general component of the allowance for loan losses is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors stratified by\nthe following loan segments: residential real estate, multi-family real estate, commercial real estate, home equity lines of credit and loans,\nconstruction, commercial and consumer. Management uses a rolling average of historical losses based on a time frame appropriate to capture\nrelevant loss data for each loan segment. This historical loss factor is adjusted for the following qualitative factors: levels/trends in delinquencies;\ntrends in volume and terms of loans; effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and other changes in lending policies,\nprocedures and practices; experience/ability/depth of lending management and staff; and national and local economic trends and conditions. There\nwere no changes in the Bank’s policies or methodology pertaining to the general component of the allowance for loan losses during 2022 or 2021.\nAlthough not separately segmented, loans subject to COVID-19 modifications and PPP loans are monitored within their respective\nsegments for purposes of identifying any potential problem loans and to ensure that their respective risks are captured in the allowance model.\nThe qualitative factors are determined based on the various risk characteristics of each loan segment. Risk characteristics relevant to each\nportfolio segment are as follows:\nResidential real estate and home equity lines of credit and loans: The Company generally does not originate loans with a loan-to-value ratio\ngreater than 80 percent without requiring private mortgage insurance. Loans in these segments are collateralized primarily by owner-occupied\nresidential real estate and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower. The overall health of the economy, including\nunemployment rates and housing prices, will have an effect on the credit quality in these segments.\nCommercial real estate and multi-family residential: Loans in these segments are primarily income-producing properties throughout\nMassachusetts. The underlying cash flows generated by the properties are adversely impacted by a\n60\ndownturn in the economy as evidenced by increased vacancy rates which, in turn, will have an effect on the credit quality in these segments.\nManagement periodically obtains rent rolls and continually monitors the cash flows of these loans.\nConstruction: The loans in this segment are residential and commercial construction-to-permanent loans collateralized by owner-occupied\nresidential and commercial real estate and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower. The overall health of the\neconomy, including unemployment rates and housing prices, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment.\nCommercial: Loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by assets of the business. Repayment is expected from\nthe cash flows of the business. A weakened economy, and resultant decreased consumer spending, will have an effect on the credit quality in this\nsegment. Also included within this segment are PPP loans. These loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA and are subject to forgiveness if the\nborrower complies with the employee retention and other requirements. Although these loans are guaranteed, management has determined that\nthere is some level of risk inherent in this portfolio.\nConsumer: Loans in this segment are generally unsecured and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower.\nAllocated Component\nThe allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial,\nmulti-family, commercial real estate, construction and residential loans and home equity lines of credit and loans by either the present value of\nexpected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. An\nallowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value) of the impaired loan are lower than the carrying value of that loan.\nLarge groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, the Bank does not separately identify\nindividual consumer loans for impairment disclosures, unless such loans are subject to a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) agreement.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the\nscheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by\nmanagement in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest\npayments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired.\nManagement determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the\ncircumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment\nrecord, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.\nThe Company periodically may agree to modify the contractual terms of loans. When a loan is modified and a concession is made to a\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty, the modification is considered a TDR. All TDRs are initially classified as impaired.\nUnallocated Component\nAn unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated\ncomponent of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating\nallocated and general reserves in the portfolio.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Cost and related allowances for depreciation\nand amortization of premises and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are removed from the respective accounts with any gain or loss\nincluded in income or expense. Depreciation and amortization are calculated principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives\nof the assets.\n61\nPremises and equipment are periodically evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount may not be recoverable. Impairment exists when the expected undiscounted future cash flows of premises and equipment are less than\ntheir carrying amount. In that event, the Company records a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the\nasset based on quoted market prices, if applicable, or a discounted cash flow analysis.\nOther Real Estate Owned and In-Substance Foreclosures\nOther real estate owned includes properties acquired through foreclosure and properties classified as in-substance repossession. These\nproperties are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure or transfer, establishing a new cost\nbasis. Subsequent to foreclosure or transfer, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of\ncarrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Any write-down from cost to estimated fair value required at the time of foreclosure or classification\nas in-substance foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Expenses incurred in connection with maintaining these assets, subsequent\nwrite-downs and gains or losses recognized upon sale are included in other expense.\nThe Company classifies commercial loans as in-substance repossessed or foreclosed if the Company receives physical possession of the\ndebtor’s assets regardless of whether formal foreclosure proceedings take place. An in-substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and the\nCompany is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan upon\neither: (1) obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure; or (2) the borrower conveying all interest in\nthe residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal\nagreement.\nAdvertising\nThe Company directly expenses costs associated with advertising as they are incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax\nrates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nAssets and liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax returns when such\npositions are judged to not meet the “more-likely-than-not” threshold, based upon the technical merits of the position. Estimated interest and\npenalties, if applicable, related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense.\nThe Company has evaluated the positions taken on its tax returns filed and the potential impact on its tax status as of December 31, 2022.\nThe Company has concluded no uncertain income tax positions exist at December 31, 2022. The Company is subject to U.S. federal, state and\nlocal income tax examinations by tax authorities for the 2019 through 2021 tax years.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nMost of the Company’s business activity is with customers located within the greater Boston area. The majority of the Company’s loan\nportfolio is comprised of loans collateralized by real estate located in the greater Boston area.\nThe Company invests in various investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market and\ncredit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is at least\n62\nreasonably possible that changes in the values of investments will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the amounts\nreported in the consolidated balance sheet or statements of income.\nIneffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition. Effective liquidity management is essential for\nthe operation of our business. We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments\non our debt obligations as they come due, and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable\ncircumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on\nterms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically, or the financial services industry or economy generally.\nFactors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the geographic markets in which our loans and\noperations are concentrated or difficult credit markets. Our access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors. In\nparticular, a portion of our liabilities are checking accounts and other liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days’ notice,\nwhile by comparison, a substantial majority of our assets are loans, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Although we have\nhistorically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, we might not be able to replace such funds in the future, especially\nif a large number of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers. The Company’s principal revenue streams come from interest and dividend income and mortgage banking activities – which are\nspecifically excluded from the scope of Topic 606. Revenue streams within the scope of Topic 606 such as customer service and account\nmaintenance fees, deposit charges, ATM interchange and other transaction fees represent an immaterial percentage of total revenue and are\nrecognized when the Company’s performance obligations have been satisfied.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share represents income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding during the period. Unallocated ESOP shares are not deemed outstanding for earnings per share calculations. ESOP shares committed\nto be released are considered to be outstanding for purposes of the earnings per share computation. ESOP shares that have not been legally\nreleased, but that relate to employee services rendered during an accounting period (interim or annual) ending before the related debt service\npayment is made, are considered committed to be released. Diluted earnings per share is determined using the treasury stock method and reflects\nadditional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to\nincome that would result from the assumed issuance.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\")\nESOP shares are shown as a reduction of equity and are presented in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity as\nunallocated common stock held by ESOP. Compensation expense for the Company’s ESOP is recorded at an amount equal to the shares\ncommitted to be allocated by the ESOP multiplied by the average fair market value of the shares during the period. The Company recognizes\ncompensation expense ratably over the period based upon the Company’s estimate of the number of shares committed to be allocated by the\nESOP. When the shares are released, unallocated common stock held by ESOP is reduced by the cost of the ESOP shares released and the\ndifference between the average fair market value and the cost of the shares committed to be allocated by the ESOP is recorded as an adjustment to\nadditional paid-in capital. The loan receivable from the ESOP is not reported as an asset nor is the Company’s guarantee to fund the ESOP\nreported as a liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.\n63\nRECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nThe Company qualifies as an emerging growth company (“EGC”) under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 and has elected\nto defer the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until the nonpublic company effective dates. As such, the Company will adopt\nstandards on the nonpublic company effective dates until such time that we no longer qualify as an EGC.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic\n842). Subsequent to the issuance of Topic 842, additional ASUs were issued to provide additional implementation guidance, practical expedients,\ntargeted improvements, and revised effective dates. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize lease right of use assets and related\nlease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with original terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or\noperating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. Lessor accounting generally remains\nunchanged with minor changes. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 with early adoption\npermitted. The Company leases two of its locations. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments. The amendments in this ASU affect entities holding financial assets and net investments in leases that are not accounted\nfor at fair value through net income. The main objective of this ASU is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information\nabout the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date.\nTo achieve this objective, the amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a\nmethodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform\ncredit loss estimates. This ASU also requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand\nsignificant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of a reporting entity’s\nportfolio. Additionally, this ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with\ncredit deterioration. The Company intends to adopt this ASU effective January 1, 2023. An entity will apply the amendments in this Update\nthrough a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (that\nis, a modified-retrospective approach). To date, the Company has been assessing the key differences and gaps between its current allowance\nmethodology with those it is considering to use upon adoption. This has included assessing the adequacy of existing data and selecting a vendor\nfor a loss model. The Company is in process of finalizing its model and executing parallel runs.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt Restructurings and\nVintage Disclosures. Update No. 2022-02 applies to public entities that have adopted ASC Topic 326. The amendments in this update eliminate\nthe existing accounting guidance for troubled debt restructures (\"TDRs\") by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, Receivables - Troubled Debt\nRestructurings by Creditors and instead requires that an entity evaluate whether a modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an\nexisting loan. The amendments also enhance disclosure requirements for certain loans refinancing and restructuring by creditors when a borrower\nis experiencing financial difficulty. ASU 2022-02 also requires additional disclosure of current period gross write-offs by year of origination for\nfinancing receivables to be included in the entity's vintage disclosure, as currently required under Topic 326. All amendments in this update are\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently\nassessing the impact of the adoption of this standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n64\nNOTE 3 – INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES\nInvestments in securities have been classified in the consolidated balance sheets according to management’s intent.

These unrealized losses relate to changes in market interest rates since acquiring the securities. As\nmanagement has the intent and ability to hold debt securities until maturity or cost recovery, no declines are deemed to be other-than-temporary.\nNOTE 4 – LOANS, ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND CREDIT QUALITY\nLoans consisted of the following as of the dates indicated:\nAt December 31, At December 31,\n2022 2021\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nReal estate loans:\nOne- to four-family residential $ 355,381 39.8% $ 259,673 49.8%\nMulti-family 241,951 27.1% 59,517 11.4%\nCommercial 156,212 17.5% 99,953 19.2%\nHome equity lines of credit and loans 27,783 3.1% 26,050 5.0%\nConstruction 107,317 12.0% 70,668 13.5%\nOther loans:\nCommercial loans 4,266 0.5% 5,439 1.0%\nConsumer 222 0.0% 500 0.1%\n893,132 100.0% 521,800 100.0%\nLess:\nNet deferred loan fees (258) (433)\nAllowance for loan losses (7,200) (4,236)\nTotal loans, net $ 885,674 $ 517,131\n66\nCertain directors and executive officers of the Company and companies in which they have a significant ownership interest are also\ncustomers of the Bank.

The financial effects of TDRs are reflected in the\ncomponents that comprise the allowance for loan losses in either the amount of charge-offs or loan loss provision and ultimate allowance level.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no loans that were modified in a troubled debt restructuring.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no loans modified as TDR loans that subsequently defaulted within one\nyear of the modification.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans were\nmodified as troubled debt restructurings.\n70\nThe following tables present the Company’s loans by risk rating as of the dates indicated:\nReal Estate\nHome Equity\nLines of\nCredit\nResidential Multi-family Commercial and Loans Construction Commercial Consumer Total\n(In Thousands)\nAs of December 31,\n2022\nGrade\nPass $ 63,817 $ 241,951 $ 156,212 $ 2,995 $ 103,272 $ 4,266 $ — $ 572,513\nSpecial\nmention 467 — — — — — — 467\nSubstandard — — — — — — — —\nDoubtful — — — — — — — —\nLoans not\nformally rated 291,097 — — 24,788 4,045 — 222 320,152\n$ 355,381 $ 241,951 $ 156,212 $ 27,783 $ 107,317 $ 4,266 $ 222 $ 893,132\nReal Estate\nHome Equity\nLines of\nCredit\nResidential Multi-family Commercial and Loans Construction Commercial Consumer Total\n(In Thousands)\nAs of December 31,\n2021\nGrade\nPass $ 34,613 $ 59,517 $ 99,953 $ 624 $ 64,623 $ 5,339 $ — $ 264,669\nSpecial mention 970 — — 99 394 100 — 1,563\nSubstandard — — — — — — — —\nDoubtful — — — — — — — —\nLoans not\nformally rated 224,090 — — 25,327 5,651 — 500 255,568\n$ 259,673 $ 59,517 $ 99,953 $ 26,050 $ 70,668 $ 5,439 $ 500 $ 521,800\nCredit Quality Information\nThe Company utilizes a seven grade internal loan rating system for multi-family and commercial real estate, construction, commercial\nloans and certain residential and home equity lines of credit and loans as follows:\nLoans rated 1 – 3: Loans in these categories are considered “pass” rated loans with low to average risk.\nLoans rated 4: Loans in this category are considered “special mention.” These loans are starting to show signs of potential weakness and\nare being closely monitored by management.\nLoans rated 5: Loans in this category are considered “substandard.” Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately\nprotected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged. There is a distinct possibility that the Bank\nwill sustain some loss if the weakness is not corrected.\nLoans rated 6: Loans in this category are considered “doubtful.” Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those\nclassified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing\nfacts, highly questionable and improbable.\nLoans rated 7: Loans in this category are considered uncollectible (loss) and of such little value that their continuance as loans is not\nwarranted.\n71\nOn an annual basis, or more often if needed, the Company formally reviews the ratings on all commercial loans with aggregate potential\noutstanding balances of $500,000 or more, and all commercial real estate loans (including multi-family and construction loans as well as\nresidential and home equity line of credit loans to commercial borrowers) with aggregate potential outstanding balances of $1,000,000 or more.\nFor all other loans, the Company initially assesses credit quality based upon the borrower’s ability to pay and subsequently monitors these loans\nbased on the borrower’s payment activity.\nThere were no consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate in the process of foreclosure as of December 31, 2022. There was\none consumer mortgage loan in the amount of $243,000 that was secured by residential real estate in the process of foreclosure as of December\n31, 2021.\nNOTE 5 – PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT\nThe following is a summary of premises and equipment as of December 31:\n2022 2021\n(in Thousands)\nBanking premises and equipment:\nLand $ 594 $ 594\nBuildings and improvements 5,699 5,691\nLeasehold improvements 301 240\nFurniture and equipment 1,554 1,407\nTotal cost 8,148 7,932\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization (4,450) (4,148)\nNet premises and equipment $ 3,698 $ 3,784\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 amounted to $302,000 and $300,000, respectively.\nNOTE 6 – DEPOSITS\nThe aggregate amount of time deposit accounts in denominations that meet or exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\ninsurance limit (currently $250,000) at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $98,419,000 and $88,836,000, respectively.\nThe aggregate amount of brokered time deposits at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $100,842,000 and $19,868,000, respectively.

There were no advances on this line.\nThe available borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $84,757,000 as of December 31, 2022 and $112,450,000 as of December 31, 2021. At\nDecember 31, 2022, the Bank had a $10,000,000 line of credit established with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank. There were no advances\non this line.\nNOTE 8 – EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nPension Plans\nDefined Benefit Plan\nThe Company provided pension benefits for its employees through membership in the Defined Benefit Plan of the Co-operative Banks\nEmployees Retirement Association (CBERA) (the Plan). The Plan is a multi-employer plan whereby the contributions by each bank are not\nrestricted to provide benefits to the employees of the contributing bank. Each employee reaching the age of 21 and having completed at least one\nyear of service automatically became eligible to participate in the Plan. Participants became vested after completion of six years of eligible\nservice.\nAt the December 15, 2021 Board of Directors' meeting, the Directors voted to freeze benefit accruals and withdraw from the CBERA Plan\nas of April 30, 2022. The Company recorded a liability as of December 31, 2021 and a related expense, each in the amount of $2,001,000, related\nto this withdrawal.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 a benefit of $582,000 was recorded to reflect a reduction in the liability related to the pending\nwithdrawal from the defined benefit plan. The reduction was primarily driven by increases in interest rates since December 31, 2021, which\ncaused defined benefit plan discount rates to rise. In May of 2022, the final withdrawal liability was determined to be $1,419,000. The Company\npaid the final amount and has withdrawn from the plan. The liability as of December 31, 2022 was $0.\n401(k) Plan\nIn addition to the defined benefit plan, the Company has adopted a savings plan which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal\nRevenue Code and provides for voluntary contributions by participating employees ranging from 1% to 75% of their compensation, subject to\ncertain limitations based on federal tax laws. The Bank makes matching contributions equal to 100% of each employee’s voluntary contributions,\nup to 7% of the employee’s compensation.\n73\nTotal expense related to the 401(k) plan for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 amounted to $362,000 and $265,000, respectively.\nEmployee Incentive Plan\nThe Company provides an employee incentive plan which is approved annually by the Board of Directors, based on various factors. The\nemployee incentive plan expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 amounted to $1,302,000 and $662,000, respectively.\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)\nThe Bank formed a SERP for certain executive officers. This plan provides nonfunded retirement benefits designed to supplement benefits\navailable through the Bank’s retirement plan for employees.\nDirector Fee Continuation Plan (DFCP)\nEffective January 1, 2017, the Bank established a Director Fee Continuation Plan which provides supplemental retirement benefits for\ndirectors. Under the DFCP, individuals who are directors as of the effective date of the DFCP are 100% vested in their benefits. Individuals who\nbecome directors after the effective date shall be fully vested in their accounts after having served on the Board of Directors for twelve years.\nThe following tables set forth information about the SERP and DFCP as of December 31 and the years then ended:\n2022 2021\nSERP DFCP SERP DFCP\n(In thousands)\nChange in projected benefit obligation:\nBenefit obligation at beginning of year $ 1,437 $ 791 $ 1,539 $ 822\nService cost 17 101 18 105\nInterest cost 34 17 29 12\nActuarial gain (232) (180) (49) (108)\nBenefits paid (100) (40) (100) (40)\nBenefit obligation at end of year 1,156 689 1,437 791\nFunded status (1,156) (689) (1,437) (791)\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, before tax effect, consist of:\n2022 2021\nSERP DFCP SERP DFCP\n(In thousands)\nNet (gain) loss $ (207) $ (128) $ 75 $ 60\nThe accumulated benefit obligation and unfunded status of the SERP was $1,156,000 and $1,437,000 at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, and is classified within “other liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Benefits are 100% vested, commence upon retirement, and are payable based on a ten-year certain and life annuity. The liability for the\nPlan amounted to $3,081,000 and $2,332,000 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The expense recognized for the Plan for the years\nended December 31, 2022 and 2021 amounted to $749,000 and $869,000, respectively.\nExecutive Deferred Compensation Agreement\n75\nIn 2021, the Company entered into a deferred compensation agreement with an executive officer that allows the Company to make\ncontributions to an account for the executive officer each year, as of January 1, based on the prior year’s performance and the Company intends\nthe contribution will equal 10% of the executive officer’s salary and bonus. The Company may make other contributions to the deferred\ncompensation plan, at its discretion, at other times during the year. Contributions made under the deferred compensation plan for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 amounted to $34,600 and $33,200, respectively.\nDeferred Compensation Plan for Directors\nThe Company maintains the Everett Co-operative Bank Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the “Director Deferred Compensation\nPlan”) to allow for certain tax planning opportunities and additional retirement income for directors of the Company. All non-employee directors\nare eligible to participate in the Director Deferred Compensation Plan. Under the Director Deferred Compensation Plan, directors may elect to\ndefer the receipt of up to 100% of their director fees. Participants are always 100% vested in their deferred fees and any interest credited to those\ndeferrals. Earnings are credited to a participant’s deferrals each year and are indexed to the highest certificate of deposit rate offered by the Bank.\nThe liability for the Director Deferred Compensation Plan amounted to $592,000 and $479,000 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nSurvivor Benefit Plan\nThe Company entered into Survivor Benefit Plan Participation Agreements with a group of employees whereby the Company is obligated\nto provide up to two years of recognized compensation, as defined, to the beneficiary if the participant dies while employed by the Company.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022 one of the participants died. The expense recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022 was\n$166,000. There was no expense recognized during 2021.\nEmployment and Change in Control Agreements\nDuring 2022, the Company entered into an employment agreement with the Chief Executive Officer and Change in Control agreements\nwith certain executive officers, which provide severance payments in the event of the executive’s involuntary or constructive termination of\nemployment, including upon a termination following a change in control as defined in the agreements.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan\nAs part of the Initial Public Offering (\"IPO\") completed on July 27, 2022, the Company established a tax-qualified Employee Stock\nOwnership Plan (\"ESOP\") to provide eligible employees the opportunity to own Company shares. The ESOP borrowed $7.3 million from the\nCompany to purchase 734,020 common shares during the IPO. The loan is payable in annual installments over 20 years at an interest rate of\n4.75%. As the loan is repaid to the Company, shares are released and allocated proportionally to eligible participants on the basis of each\nparticipant’s proportional share of compensation relative to the compensation of all participants. The unallocated ESOP shares are pledged as\ncollateral on the loan.\nThe Company accounts for its ESOP in accordance with FASB ASC 718-40, Compensation – Stock Compensation. Under this guidance,\nunreleased shares are deducted from shareholders’ equity as unearned ESOP shares in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The\nCompany recognizes compensation expense equal to the fair value of the ESOP shares during the periods in which they are committed to be\nreleased. To the extent that the fair value of the Company’s ESOP shares differs from the cost of such shares, the difference will be credited or\ndebited to additional paid-in capital included within shareholders' equity. As the loan is internally leveraged, the loan receivable from the ESOP to\nthe Company is not reported as an asset nor is the debt of the ESOP shown as a liability in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\n76\nTotal compensation expense recognized in connection with the ESOP was $559,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. There was no\nexpense recognized in 2021 related to the ESOP.

If any\nportion of the reserve is used for purposes other than to absorb the losses for which it was established, approximately 150% of the amount actually\nused (limited to the amount of the reserve) would be subject to taxation in the year it is used. As the Bank intends to use the reserve only to absorb\nloan losses, a deferred income tax liability of approximately $527,000 has not been provided as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had a charitable contribution carryover of $2,412,000 which expires on December 31, 2027. There is\nno valuation allowance recorded against the related deferred tax asset as the Company deems it probable that the deferred tax benefits will be fully\nrealized.\nNOTE 10 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nDuring 2018, the Bank entered into a lease agreement with a related party for office space. The initial lease term expires in February 2023\nand contains a five year option to extend, as well as a cancellation clause permitting the Bank to cancel the lease anytime during the initial term\nwith sixty days’ notice. Annual rent is approximately $48,000, payable monthly, not including an annual tenant improvement credit of $18,000\nduring the original term. The Bank is responsible for a portion of common area charges, as well as other customary leasehold costs. Net annual\nrental payments amounted to $30,000 and $28,000 for 2022 and 2021, respectively. In February of 2022, the lease was amended to replace the\nfive year option to extend with three options to extend the term of two years, two years and one year. In addition, during February 2022, a new\nlease agreement was entered into with the related party for additional office space. The initial lease term expired in February 2023 and contains\nthree options to extend the term of two years, two years and one year. The first two year option was exercised during 2022. Annual rent is\napproximately $21,000, payable monthly. The Bank is responsible for a portion of common area charges, as well as other customary leasehold\ncosts. Net annual rental payments amounted to $18,000 for 2022.\nThe Company utilizes the services of a law firm that is a related party for loan closings and related matters as well as general corporate\nlegal matters. Fees for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $145,000 and $253,000, respectively.\nThe Company utilizes the services of one of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company for loan closings and related matters.\nFees for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $307,000 and $305,000, respectively.\n78\nNOTE 11 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement – Overall, provides a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP. This guidance also\nallows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a\ncontract-by-contract basis.\nIn accordance with ASC 820-10, the Company groups its financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in three levels,\nbased on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value.\nLevel 1 – Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in active exchange markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Valuations are\nobtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in less active dealer or broker markets. Valuations are obtained from third party pricing\nservices for identical or comparable assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 – Valuations for assets and liabilities that are derived from other methodologies, including option pricing models, discounted cash\nflow models and similar techniques, and are not based on market exchange, dealer, or broker traded transactions. Level 3 valuations incorporate\ncertain assumptions and projections in determining the fair value assigned to such assets and liabilities.\nA financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\nA description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such\ninstruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below. These valuation methodologies were applied to all of the Company’s financial\nassets and financial liabilities carried at fair value for December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nThe Company’s investment in debt instruments available for sale is generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For those\nsecurities, the Bank obtains fair value measurements from independent pricing services. The fair value measurements consider observable data\nthat considers standard input factors such as observable market data, benchmark yields, interest rate volatilities, broker/dealer quotes, credit\nspreads and new issue data.\nThe Company’s impaired loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.\nCollateral values are estimated using appraisals obtained from a third party, and are adjusted for selling costs. These appraised values may be\ndiscounted based on management’s historical knowledge, expertise, or changes in the market conditions from time of valuation. For Level 3\ninputs, fair values are based upon management’s estimates of the value of the underlying collateral or the present value of the expected cash flows.\n79\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the following summarizes assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nTotal Quoted Prices Significant Significant\nin Active Other Unobservable\nMarkets for Observable Inputs\nIdentical Assets Inputs Level 3\nLevel 1 Level 2\n(In Thousands)\nDecember 31, 2022\nCorporate bonds $ 5,001 $ — $ 5,001 $ —\n$ —\nTotal available for-sale-securities $ 5,001 $ — $ 5,001 $ —\nDecember 31, 2021\nCorporate bonds $ 5,010 $ — $ 5,010 $ —\nTotal available for-sale-securities $ 5,010 $ — $ 5,010 $ —\nUnder certain circumstances, the Company makes adjustments to its assets and liabilities although they are not measured at fair value on an\nongoing basis.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Bank had no assets or liabilities for which a nonrecurring change in fair value had\nbeen recorded.\nASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis. The\nmethodologies for estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or non-\nrecurring basis are discussed above. ASU 2016-01 requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of\nfinancial instruments for disclosure purposes. The exit price notion is a market-based measurement of fair value that is represented by the price to\nsell an asset or transfer a liability in the principal market (or most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market) on the measurement\ndate. For December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, fair values of loans are estimated on an exit price basis incorporating discounts for credit,\nliquidity and marketability factors.\nDecember 31, 2022\nCarrying Fair\nAmount Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(In Thousands)\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 62,050 $ 62,050 $ 62,050 $ - $ -\nInterest bearing time deposits 300 300 - 300 -\nHeld-to-maturity securities 77,591 69,707 - 69,707 -\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock 7,293 7,293 - 7,293 -\nLoans, net 885,674 841,271 - - 841,271\nAccrued interest receivable 2,632 2,632 2,632 - -\nBank-owned life insurance 14,067 14,067 - 14,067 -\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits, other than certificates of deposit $ 398,302 $ 398,302 $ - $ 398,302 $ -\nCertificates of deposit 319,847 310,943 - 310,943 -\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances 174,000 172,427 - 172,427 -\nAccrued interest payable 736 736 736 - -\n80\nDecember 31, 2021\nCarrying Fair\nAmount Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(In Thousands)\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 52,975 $ 52,975 $ 52,975 $ - $ -\nHeld-to-maturity securities 65,571 65,556 - 65,556 -\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock 1,087 1,087 - 1,087 -\nLoans, net 517,131 517,167 - - 517,167\nLoans held for sale 1,301 1,322 - 1,322 -\nAccrued interest receivable 1,481 1,481 1,481 - -\nBank-owned life insurance 14,135 14,135 - 14,135 -\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits, other than certificates of deposit $ 344,934 $ 344,934 $ - $ 344,934 $ -\nCertificates of deposit 226,820 227,265 - 227,265 -\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances 9,000 8,969 - 8,969 -\nAccrued interest payable 49 49 49 - -\nNOTE 12 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of\nits customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying\ndegrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The contract or notional\namounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to\nextend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making\ncommitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the\ncontract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company\nevaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company\nupon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies but usually includes income\nproducing commercial properties or residential real estate.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance by a customer to a third party.\nThe credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. As of\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the maximum potential amount of the Company’s obligation was $13,000 and $13,000, respectively,\nfor standby letters of credit. The Company’s outstanding letters of credit generally have a term of less than one year. If a letter of credit is drawn\nupon, the Company may seek recourse through the customer’s underlying line of credit. If the customer’s line of credit is also in default, the\nCompany may take possession of the collateral, if any, securing the line of credit.\n81\nAmounts of financial instrument liabilities whose contract amounts represent off-balance sheet credit risk are as follows as of the dates\nindicated:\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\n(In Thousands)\nCommitments to originate loans $ 37,220 $ 24,658\nCommitments to purchase loans 6,653 -\nUnadvanced funds on lines of credit 80,224 45,548\nUnadvanced funds on construction loans 72,431 37,352\nLetters of credit 13 13\n$ 196,541 $ 107,571\nThe Bank accrues for credit losses related to off-balance sheet financial instruments. Potential losses on off-balance sheet loan\ncommitments are estimated using the same risk factors used to determine the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for off-balance sheet\ncommitments is recorded within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amounted to $402,000 and $235,000 as of December 31,\n2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nNOTE 13 – OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nAccounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Although certain\nchanges in assets and liabilities are reported as a separate component of the shareholders' equity section of the consolidated balance sheets, such\nitems, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income.\nThe components of other comprehensive income and related tax effects are as follows for the years ended December 31 2022 and 2021:\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nChange in unrealized gains on securities:\nChange in net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale securities (10) (25)\nReclassification adjustment for realized gains in net income — —\nOther comprehensive loss related to available-for-sale securities (10) (25)\nIncome tax benefit 3 7\nNet-of-tax amount (7) (18)\nNet actuarial gain on SERP 232 49\nReclassification adjustment for amortization of net actuarial loss (1) 50 83\nOther comprehensive income related to SERP 282 132\nIncome tax expense (79) (37)\nNet-of-tax amount 203 95\nNet actuarial gain on director fee continuation plan 179 108\nReclassification adjustment for amortization of net actuarial loss (2) 10 59\nOther comprehensive income related to director fee continuation plan 189 167\nIncome tax expense (53) (47)\nNet-of-tax amount 136 120\nOther comprehensive income, net of tax $ 332 $ 197\n(1) Reclassification adjustments are comprised of amortization of unrecognized SERP costs. The amortization of unrecognized SERP costs has been reclassified\nout of accumulated other comprehensive loss and has affected certain lines in the consolidated statements of income as follows: the amount is included in other\nexpense; the tax expense in the amounts of $14,000 and $23,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, is included in income tax\nexpense; and the net of tax amount is included in net income.\n82\n(2) Reclassification adjustments are comprised of amortization of unrecognized Director Fee Continuation Plan (DFCP) costs. The amortization of unrecognized\nDFCP costs has been reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss and has affected certain lines in the consolidated statements of income as follows:\nthe amount is included in other expense; the tax expense in the amounts of $3,000 and $17,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,\nare included in income tax expense; and the net of tax amount is included in net income.\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 consists of unrecognized benefit costs,\nnet of taxes, and unrealized holding gains on securities available for sale, net of tax, as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n2022 As of December 31, 2021\n(In thousands)\nNet unrealized holding gains on securities available-for-sale, net of tax $ 9 $ 14\nUnrecognized SERP credits (costs), net of tax 149 (53)\nUnrecognized director fee continuation plan credits (costs), net of tax 91 (44)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ 249 $ (83)\nNOTE 14 – REGULATORY MATTERS\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines\nand prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under\nregulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk\nweighting and other factors. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary\nactions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\nManagement believes, as of December 31, 2022, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-\nbased, Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since that\nnotification that management believes have changed the Bank’s category.\nThe Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in the table as of the dates indicated:\nMinimum For Capital Minimum To Be Well\nAdequacy Purposes Capitalized Under\nPlus Capital Prompt Corrective\nActual Conservation Buffer Action Provisions\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nAs of December 31, 2022\nTotal Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) $ 138,023 16.40% $ 88,386 10.50% $ 84,177 10.00%\nTier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 130,421 15.49% 71,550 8.50% 67,342 8.00%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 130,421 15.49% 58,924 7.00% 54,715 6.50%\nTier 1 Capital (to Average Assets) 130,421 13.89% 37,562 4.00% 46,953 5.00%\nAs of December 31, 2021\nTotal Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) $ 81,827 17.77% $ 48,355 10.50% $ 46,052 10.00%\nTier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 77,356 16.80% 39,144 8.50% 36,842 8.00%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (to Risk Weighted Assets) 77,356 16.80% 32,236 7.00% 29,934 6.50%\nTier 1 Capital (to Average Assets) 77,356 11.83% 26,164 4.00% 32,705 5.00%\n83\nIn addition to the above minimum requirements, the Bank is subject to a Capital Conservation Buffer requirement of 2.5%.

Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares (such as stock\noptions) were exercised or converted into additional common shares that would then share in the earnings of the entity. Diluted EPS is computed\nby dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year, plus the\neffect of potential dilutive common share equivalents computed using the treasury stock method. There were no securities that had a dilutive effect\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022, and therefore the weighted-average common shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and\ndiluted EPS are the same. Unallocated ESOP shares are not deemed outstanding for earnings per share calculations. Earnings per share data is not\napplicable for the year ended December 31, 2021 as the Company had no shares outstanding.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2022\n(dollars in thousands, except per\nshare data)\nNet income applicable to common shares $ 2,720\nAverage number of common shares outstanding 9,175,247\nLess: Average unallocated ESOP shares (719,029)\nAverage number of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per common share 8,456,218\nCommon stock equivalents -\nAverage number of common shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per common share 8,456,218\nEarnings per common share\nBasic $ 0.32\nDiluted $ 0.32\nNOTE 17 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nManagement has reviewed events occurring through March 30, 2023, the date the consolidated financial statements were issued and\ndetermined that no subsequent events occurred requiring adjustment to or disclosure in these consolidated financial statements.\n86\nITEM 9.

The Everett Co-operative Bank Annual Incentive Plan (“AIP”) was implemented in 2022 and replaces the\nEverett Co-operative Bank Employee Incentive Plan in its entirety. The AIP provides that for each performance period (January 1 – December 31),\nthere is an aggregate bonus pool established by the board of directors. The aggregate bonus pool is the sum of the bonus targets of all AIP\nparticipants. After the end of the each Performance Period, the Compensation Committee determines the percentage of the target aggregate bonus\npool that will be available for payouts (if any), based on the satisfaction of the Bank performance metrics as compared to target. No payouts are\nmade under the AIP if the Bank does not achieve 85% of its target Pre-Provision Net Revenue, for the applicable performance period. For\npurposes of the January 1, 2022 – December 31, 2022 performance period, the Company used the following performance metrics and weighting:\n91\nPre-provision Net Revenue 30%\nNet Charge Off 15%\nEfficiency Ratios 15%\nLoan Growth 20%\nStrategic Initiatives 20%\nBased on Bank performance, the aggregate bonus pool can be funded between 0% and 150% of target. Following a review of the Bank’s\n2022 performance under the metrics noted above, the aggregate bonus pool for the 2022 AIP was established at 150% of target.\nUnder the terms of the AIP, the aggregate bonus pool is distributed over five employee tiers with each tier having its own incentive\nopportunities and payouts based on individual performance. The Named Executive Officers are all in tier 1 and have a threshold, target and\nmaximum incentive opportunity of 15%, 30% and 45%, respectively, of base salary. Following a performance review of each of the Named\nExecutive Officers, the Board of Directors approved a maximum payout for each of the Named Executive Officers under the 2022 AIP. See the\nSummary Compensation Table above, “Non-Equity Incentive Compensation” column for the 2022 AIP payouts to the Named Executive Officers.\nEmployment Agreement. The Bank and the Company entered into an employment agreement with Richard J. O’Neil, Jr. The term of Mr.\nO’Neil’s employment agreement is three years, unless otherwise extended in accordance with the terms of the employment agreement.\nCommencing on the first anniversary of the effective date of the employment agreement (December 21, 2023) and continuing on each December\n21st thereafter, the term of the employment agreement extends for an additional year, so that the term again becomes three years. At least 60 days\nprior to each anniversary date of the employment agreement, the Company and the Bank must conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation\nof Mr. O’Neil and affirmatively approve any extension of the agreement for an additional year or determine not to extend the term of the\nagreement. If the Company and the Bank determine not to extend the term, Mr. O’Neil must receive at least 30 days’ notice, but not more than 60\ndays’ notice, prior to the applicable anniversary date. If a change in control occurs during the term of the employment agreement, the term of the\nagreement will automatically renew for two years from the effective date of the change in control.\nThe employment agreement provides Mr. O’Neil with a current annual base salary of $425,000. The Company and the Bank will review\nMr. O’Neil’s base salary at least annually and his base salary may be increased, but not decreased (other than a decrease which is applicable to all\nsenior officers) during the term of the agreement. In addition to receiving a base salary, Mr. O’Neil participates in any bonus programs and benefit\nplans that are made available to other Bank executives and receives a monthly automobile allowance of $1,000. The employment agreement also\nprovides that Mr. O’Neil will be reimbursed for all reasonable business expenses incurred in performing his duties.\nIn the event Mr. O’Neil voluntarily terminates employment without “good reason,” he will be entitled to receive the sum of (i) his earned\nand unpaid base salary as of his termination date and (ii) his earned and unpaid annual bonus and long-term incentive compensation as of his\ntermination date (his “Accrued Obligations”).\nIn the event Mr. O’Neil’s employment involuntary terminates for reasons other than cause, disability, or death, or in the event of his\nresignation for “good reason,” in either event other than in connection with a change in control, he will receive his Accrued Obligations and his\nbase salary for the remaining term of the agreement. In addition, Mr. O’Neil is entitled to continued coverage under the Bank’s health insurance\nplans (to the extent permitted by the plans and law) until the earlier of 18 months following his termination date or his procurement of health\ninsurance coverage under another plan.\nIn the event Mr. O’Neil’s employment involuntary terminates for reasons other than cause, disability, or death, or in the event of Mr.\nO’Neil’s resignation for “good reason,” in either case within 24 months following a change in control, he will receive his Accrued Obligations,\nalong with a single lump sum cash payment equal to three times the sum of his base salary and average cash bonus earned during the three years\npreceding the change in control. In addition, Mr. O’Neil will be provided continued coverage under the Bank’s health insurance plans (to the\nextent permitted by the plans and law)\n92\nuntil the earlier of 18 months following his termination date or his procurement of health insurance coverage under another plan. In the event\ncontinued coverage is not available under the plans or applicable law, Mr. O’Neil will receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the total cost of\nCOBRA coverage for 18 months.\nMr. O’Neil’s employment agreements provide for a “best net benefits” approach in the event that severance benefits under the agreements\nor otherwise result in “excess parachute payments” under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The best net benefits\napproach reduces an executive’s payments and benefits to avoid triggering the excise tax if the reduction would result in a greater after-tax amount\nto the executive officer compared to the amount the executive officer would receive net of the excise tax if no reduction were made.\nTo the extent that a payment is made or a benefit is paid by the Bank under Mr. O’Neil’s employment agreement, the same payment or\nbenefit will not be paid by the Company.\nFor purposes of the employment agreement, “good reason” includes (i) a material reduction in Mr. O’Neil’s authority, duties or\nresponsibilities, (ii) a material reduction in his base compensation (other than one that is part of an overall adjustment affecting all or substantially\nall of the Bank’s executives), (iii) a relocation of his principal place of employment by more than 25 miles from the Bank’s main office location;\nor (iv) a material breach of the employment agreement by the Bank or Company.\nShould Mr. O’Neil become disabled during the term of the employment agreement, following a separation from service, he will be entitled\nto the Accrued Obligations plus disability benefits, if any, provided under a long-term disability plan sponsored by the Bank. In the event Mr.\nO’Neil dies while employed by the Bank, his beneficiaries will receive the Accrued Obligations plus any benefit payable under the group-term life\ninsurance program sponsored by the Bank. His beneficiary will also receive a death benefit under the Survivor Benefit Plan.\nUpon Mr. O’Neil’s retirement, he will be entitled to benefits under any retirement plans to which he is a party but shall not be entitled to\nany amount or benefits under the employment agreement.\nUpon any termination of employment that would entitle Mr. O’Neil to a severance payment, Mr. O’Neil will be required to adhere to one-\nyear non-competition and non-solicitation covenants.\nChange in Control Agreements. The Bank maintains change in control agreements with Messrs. Citrano and Migliozzi. The Company acts\nas a guarantor of the payments due under these change in control agreements. The change in control agreement with Mr. Citrano has a three year\nterm and Mr. Migliozzi’s change in control agreement is for a two year term. The change in control agreements provide that commencing on the\nfirst anniversary of the effective date of the change in control agreements (December 21, 2023) and continuing on each December 21st thereafter,\nthe Chief Executive Officer of the Bank must conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of each executive and the Bank must affirmatively\napprove any extension of the agreement for an additional year or determine not to extend the term of the agreements. If the Bank determines not to\nextend the term, it must notify the executive at least 30 days, but not more than 60 days, prior to the anniversary date of the change in control\nagreement.\nIn the event either executive’s employment involuntary terminates for reasons other than cause, or in the event of the executive’s\nresignation for “good reason,” (which is defined in the same manner as the term is defined in Mr. O’Neil’s employment agreement), in either\nevent within 24 months following a change in control, the executive will receive his Accrued Obligations (defined the same as in Mr. O’Neil’s\nemployment agreement) plus a severance payment equal to two and one-half times the sum of his base salary and average bonus for the preceding\nthree years for Mr. Citrano, and two times the sum of his base salary and average bonus for the preceding three years for Mr. Migliozzi. In\naddition, Messrs. Citrano and Migliozzi will be provided continued coverage under the Bank’s health insurance plans (to the extent permitted by\nthe plans and law) until the earlier of 18 months following the executives’ termination date or procurement of health insurance coverage under\nanother plan. In the event continued coverage is not available under the plans or applicable law, the executives will receive a lump sum cash\npayment equal to the total cost of COBRA coverage for 18 months.\n93\nThe change in control agreements provide for a “best net benefits” approach in the event that severance benefits under the agreements or\notherwise result in “excess parachute payments” under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The best net benefits\napproach reduces an executive’s payments and benefits to avoid triggering the excise tax if the reduction would result in a greater after-tax amount\nto the executive officer compared to the amount the executive officer would receive net of the excise tax if no reduction were made.\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP I). Everett Co-operative Bank maintains the Everett Co-operative Bank Supplemental\nExecutive Retirement Plan for Richard J. O’Neil, Jr. (“SERP I”) to provide certain tax planning opportunities and supplemental income for Mr.\nO’Neil upon his retirement, death, or disability. Under SERP I, the Bank will pay Mr. O’Neil a normal retirement benefit beginning the first day\nof the month following his separation from service on or after his “normal retirement age” of age 67. The normal retirement benefit equals 60%\nof his “final average compensation,” offset by (i) the employer portion of his social security benefits calculated as of his normal retirement date,\n(ii) the actuarial equivalent of his 401(k) benefits attributable to employer matching contributions calculated as a single life annuity at his normal\nretirement date and (iii) the benefits paid under the Bank’s defined benefit pension plan calculated as a 10-year certain and life annuity at his\nnormal retirement date. The Bank will pay the normal retirement benefit under the SERP I in an actuarial equivalent of a 10-year certain and life\nannuity. For purposes of SERP I, Mr. O’Neil’s “final average compensation” is defined as the average of the salary and bonuses paid during the\nthree years prior to his separation from service. Mr. O’Neil is always 100% vested in his benefits under SERP I. However, he will not receive any\nbenefits under SERP I if his employment terminates for cause (as defined in SERP I).\nIf Mr. O’Neil separates from service prior to attaining age 67, his benefits under SERP I will be calculated in the same manner as the\nnormal retirement benefit but will be calculated as of the date of his separation from service. The early retirement benefit will be paid in the form\nof a 10-year certain and life annuity beginning the first day of the month following the day he attains age 67.\nIn the event Mr. O’Neil becomes disabled (as defined in SERP I) while employed prior to attaining age 67, his benefit under SERP I will\nequal the actuarial equivalent of the normal retirement benefit assuming he had continued to provide services to the Bank until age 67 and that his\ncompensation increased at the rate of five percent from the date of his disability until age 67. The determination of the disability benefit also\nassumes Mr. O’Neil would have continued contributing to the retirement plans offsetting the benefit at the same rate and that the plans would earn\na six percent return on investment. The disability benefit will be paid in the form of a 10-year certain and life annuity commencing on the first\nday of the first month following the date Mr. O’Neil becomes disabled.\nIn the event of Mr. O’Neil’s death before benefit payments begin under SERP I, a death benefit will be calculated in the same manner as the\ndisability benefit but will be paid to Mr. O’Neil’s beneficiary in a lump sum within 90 days of his death. In the event he dies while receiving\nbenefits under SERP I, his beneficiary will receive any remaining payments under SERP I in the same amount and at the same time Mr. O’Neil\nwould have received the benefits had he survived.\nIn the event of a change in control, Mr. O’Neil will receive a change in control benefit calculated in the same manner as the disability\nbenefit but payable in a lump sum within 90 days of the change in control.\nBenefits payable under SERP I upon Mr. O’Neil’s separation from service may be delayed for a period of six months, if necessary, to\ncomply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.\nDeferred Compensation Plan. Everett Co-operative Bank maintains a Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Deferred\nCompensation Plan”) for the benefit of John Citrano. The Deferred Compensation Plan became effective on May 1, 2021 and allows the Bank to\nmake contributions to an account for Mr. Citrano each year, as of January 1, based on the prior year’s performance and intends the contribution\nwill equal 10% of Mr. Citrano’s salary and bonus. The Bank may make other contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan, at its discretion,\nat other times during the year. Contributions made under the Deferred Compensation Plan will earn interest each year at a rate benchmarked to\nthe 10-year Treasury bill as of the December 1 of the prior year. Mr. Citrano is 0% vested in his benefit under the Deferred Compensation Plan\nfor the first four years. Thereafter, he will vest at the rate of 20% per year, so that he will be 100% vested after eight years of service. His benefits\nwill also become 100% vested upon his death, disability, or a change in control. The Bank may also accelerate the vesting schedule at its\ndiscretion.\n94\nIf Mr. Citrano separates from service prior to attaining age 67, the Bank will pay him the vested benefit under the Deferred Compensation\nPlan over 10 years. The benefit payments will begin the first day of the month following the month in which he attains age 67. If Mr. Citrano\nseparates from service on or after attaining age 67, his benefits (payable over ten years) will begin the first day of the month following his\nseparation from service.\nIf Mr. Citrano separates from service within six months of a change in control, he will receive his benefits in a lump sum within 30 days of\nthe separation from service. In the event of his death, his beneficiary will receive the benefits due under the plan, paid in a lump sum within 30\ndays of his death.\nBenefits payable under the Deferred Compensation Plan upon Mr. Citrano’s separation from service may be delayed for a period of six\nmonths, if necessary, to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.\nSurvivor Benefit Plan. The Bank maintains the Everett Co-operative Bank Survivor Benefit Plan (the “Survivor Plan”) for the purpose of\nproviding a survivor benefit to the beneficiaries of certain key employees. Under the Survivor Plan, if a participant dies while employed, the Bank\nwill pay the participant’s beneficiary (i) an amount equal to 100% of the participant’s current base salary for one year and (ii) 50% of the\nparticipant’s current base salary for each of the four following years. The benefit is payable monthly beginning on the first day of the month\nfollowing the participants' death. Mr. O’Neil participates in the Survivor Plan.\n401(k) Plan. The Bank participates in the Defined Contribution Plan (Plan A) of CBERA, a tax-qualified defined contribution plan for\neligible employees (the “401(k) Plan”). The named executive officers are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan on the same terms as other\neligible employees of the Bank. Eligible employees become participants in the 401(k) Plan after having attained age 21 and completing one\nmonth of eligibility service in which they work at least 83 hours of service. All of the Named Executive Officers participate in the 401(k) Plan.\nUnder the 401(k) Plan, a participant may elect to defer, on a pre-tax basis, the maximum amount of compensation permitted by the Internal\nRevenue Code, to the extent that amount does not exceed 75% of their compensation. . In addition to salary deferral contributions, Everett Co-\noperative Bank currently makes matching contributions at the level of 100% of the participant’s salary deferral on the first 7% of the participant’s\ncompensation. The Bank may also make other discretionary contributions to the 401(k) Plan.\nA participant is always 100% vested in his or her salary deferral contributions. A participant will vest in matching and other employer\ncontributions at the rate of 20% per year of service, beginning after two years of service, so that a participant will become fully vested after\ncompleting six years of credited service. Generally, unless the participant elects otherwise, the participant’s account balance will be distributed\nfollowing the participant’s termination of employment. However, participants may take in-service withdrawals from the 401(k) Plan in certain\ncircumstances, including for loans and hardships.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan. The Bank participates in the Defined Contribution Plan (Plan C) of CBERA, a tax-qualified defined benefit\npension plan for eligible employees (the “Pension Plan”). The Pension Plan was frozen effective as of April 30, 2022. Freezing the Pension Plan\neliminated all future participation and benefit accruals; however, the accrued benefits as of April 30, 2022, will remain. Messrs. O’Neil and\nCitrano have accrued benefits under the Pension Plan.\nMessrs O’Neil and Citrano participate in the Pension Plan on the same terms as other employees. The normal retirement benefit formula\nunder the Pension Plan provides for a benefit, payable at age 65 as a lifetime annuity, equal to: (i) 0.75% of a participant’s “ final average\ncompensation,” multiplied by total years of service since 1989, plus (ii) 0.50% of the participant’s “ covered compensation,” multiplied by total\nyears of service since 1989. “ Final average compensation” is defined as a participant’s highest three consecutive calendar years’ compensation\nwhile participating in the plan. “Covered compensation” means the average Social Security Wage Base (as published by the Social Security\nAdministration) during the 35 years prior to the participant’ s Social Security retirement date. A participant vested in his or her benefit under the\nplan at a rate of 20% per year commencing after the completion of two years of credited service, so that the participant becomes 100% vested\nupon completion of six years of credited service. A participant may elect to\n95\nretire early under the Pension Plan if he or she attained: (i) age 62; (ii) age 55, with at least 5 years of service or (iii) age 50, with at least 15 years\nof service.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan. The Bank maintains the Everett Co-operative Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) for\neligible Bank employees. Eligible employees include employees who have attained age 21 and have completed one year of service. Eligible\nemployees enter the ESOP upon the first entry date commencing on or after the eligible employee’s completion of 1,000 hours of service during a\ncontinuous 12-month period.\nEach year, in connection with the annual ESOP loan payment, 1 /20th of the unallocated ESOP shares held in the ESOP Trust are allocated\nto participant accounts based on each participant’s proportional share of eligible plan compensation relative to all participants in the ESOP. The\nrecord keeper for the ESOP allocates the released shares among the participants’ accounts based on each participant’s proportional share of\ncompensation relative to all participants. Generally, participants vest in their ESOP benefit at a rate of 20% per year beginning after one year of\nservice, such that the participants will be 100% vested upon completion of five years of credited services. Participants employed by the Bank\nimmediately prior to the Bank’s mutual to stock conversion receive credit for vesting purposes for years of service prior to adoption of the ESOP.\nParticipants also will become fully vested upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the ESOP. Generally,\nparticipants will receive distributions from the ESOP upon separation from service with the Bank. The ESOP reallocates any unvested shares\nforfeited upon termination of employment among the remaining participants.\nFor the 2022 plan year, Mssrs. O'Neil and Citrano participated in the ESOP.\nDirectors’ Compensation\nThe following table sets forth for the year ended December 31, 2022 certain information as to the total remuneration we paid to our non-employee\ndirectors.\nFees Earned or Paid All Other\nName in Cash ($) Compensation ($) Total ($)\nPaul A. Delory 45,000 — 45,000\nElizabeth P. Jones 45,000 — 45,000\nDennis J. Leonard 75,000 — 75,000\nJoseph Sachetta 50,000 — 50,000\nSusan Sgroi 48,000 — 48,000\nMarjorie A. White 45,000 — 45,000\nDirector Fees. For the 2022 calendar year, non-employee directors of the Bank received an annual cash retainer of $45,000, except for the\nChairman of the Board, who received an annual retainer fee of $75,000. In addition to the annual retainer, the chair of the Audit Committee\nreceived an annual committee retainer of $5,000 and the chair of the Compensation Committee received an annual committee retainer of $3,000.\nMr. O’Neil does not receive fees for his service on the board of directors. The Company engaged Aon, an independent compensation consulting\nfirm, to review the Company’s director compensation structure for 2023 and effective January 1, 2023, the annual cash retainer for each non-\nemployee director is $50,000, except for the Chairman of the Board, who will receive an annual retainer of $80,000. In addition, the annual\nretainer for the Company committee chairpersons will be $12,000 for the Audit Committee, $10,000 for the Compensation Committee and $3,000\nfor the Governance Committee. Each individual who serves as a director of the Bank also serves as a director of the Company. No additional fees\nwere paid in 2022 for attending meetings of the Company Board of Directors or of its committees.\nDirector Deferred Fee Plan. The Bank maintains the Everett Co-operative Bank Director Fee Continuation Plan (the “Deferred Fee\nPlan”). Directors of the Bank who were serving on the Board of Directors of the Bank as of January 1, 2017 became participants in the Deferred\nFee Plan as of that date and are fully vested in their benefits under the Deferred Fee Plan. Directors who become participants after January 1,\n2017, become 50% vested in their benefits after seven years of board service and 100% vested after 12 years of board service. Upon a director’s\nseparation from service from the Board of Directors on or after attaining their normal retirement age, the director will receive an annual benefit for\nten years. If a director separates from service prior to the director’s normal retirement age, he or she will receive the vested portion of their\nbenefits in 10 annual installments beginning after their normal retirement age (as if they had separated\n96\nfrom service after attaining their normal retirement age). If a director dies prior to separating from service, his or her beneficiary will receive the\npresent value of the benefit within 90 days of the director’s death. If the director dies while benefits are being paid, his or her beneficiary will\nreceive the present value of the remaining payments in a lump sum within 90 days of the director’s death. If a director separates from service\nwithin two years of a change in control, the director will receive the present value of their benefits in a lump sum. The normal retirement age and\nannual benefit for each director is set forth in a schedule to the Deferred Fee Plan. The normal retirement age under the Deferred Fee Plan is age\n75 for all current directors. The annual normal retirement age benefit for all current directors, other than Mr. Sachetta, is $20,000. The annual\nnormal retirement benefit for Mr. Sachetta is $32,500. Mr. O’Neil participates in the Deferred Fee Plan on the same basis as other directors. All of\nthe current directors participate in the Deferred Fee Plan.\nDirector Deferred Compensation Plan. The Bank maintains the Everett Co-operative Bank Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the\n“Director Deferred Compensation Plan”) to allow for certain tax planning opportunities and additional retirement income for directors of the\nBank. All non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the Director Deferred Compensation Plan. Under the Director Deferred\nCompensation Plan, directors may elect to defer the receipt of up to 100% of their director fees. Participants are always 100% vested in their\ndeferred fees and any interest credited to those deferrals. Earnings are credited to a participant’s deferrals each year and are indexed to the highest\ncertificate of deposit rate offered by the Bank. The Bank, at its discretion, may instead determine earnings under the Director Deferred\nCompensation Plan based on certain hypothetical investments. The timing of benefit payments under the Director Deferred Compensation Plan\nwill occur on a fixed date, as elected by the participant or upon a separation from service. Benefits will be paid in either a lump sum or up to three\nannual installments, as elected by the participant. Benefits may be distributed earlier than normal if a director incurs certain financial hardships.\nDirectors Leonard, Sachetta and Sgroi have deferral accounts in the Director Deferred Compensation Plan.\nITEM 12.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence\nTransactions With Certain Related Persons\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits publicly traded companies from making loans to their executive officers and directors,\nbut it contains a specific exemption from such prohibition for loans made by federally insured financial institutions, such as Everett Co-operative\nBank, to their executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking regulations. At December 31, 2022, all of our loans to directors\nand executive officers were made in the ordinary course of business, were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and\ncollateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to Everett Co-operative Bank, and did not involve more\nthan the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. These loans were performing according to their original terms at\nDecember 31, 2022, and were made in compliance with federal banking regulations.\nDuring 2018, the Bank entered into a lease agreement with an entity owned by our Chief Executive Officer, Richard J. O'Neil, Jr. and his\nbrother David O'Neil, for office space. The initial lease term expired in February 2023 and contained a five year option to extend, as well as a\ncancellation clause permitting the Bank to cancel the lease anytime during the initial term with sixty days’ notice. Annual rent is approximately\n$48,000, payable monthly, not including an annual tenant improvement credit of $18,000 during the original term. The Bank is responsible for a\nportion of common area charges, as well as other customary leasehold costs. Net annual rental payments amounted to $30,000 and $28,000 for\n2022 and 2021, respectively. In February of 2022, the lease was amended to replace the five year option to extend with three options to extend the\nterm of two years, two years and one year. Aggregate payments made during 2022 and through the last option term amount to $186,000. In\naddition, during February 2022, a second lease agreement was entered into with the same related parties for additional office space. The initial\nlease term expired in February 2023 and contains three options to extend the term of two years, two years and one year. The first two year option\nwas exercised during 2022. Annual rent is approximately $21,000, payable monthly. The Bank is responsible for a portion of common area\ncharges, as well as other customary leasehold costs. Net annual rental payments amounted to $18,000 for 2022. Aggregate payments made during\n2022 and through the last option term amount to $162,000.\nThe Company utilizes the services of a local law firm for loan closings and related matters as well as general corporate legal matters. The\nfirm is owned by David O'Neil, who is the brother of our Chief Executive Officer. Annual\n98\nfees paid to the law firm for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $145,000 and $253,000, respectively.\nThe Company utilizes the services of Director Paul Delory for loan closings and related matters. Annual fees paid to the law firm for the\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were $307,000 and $305,000, respectively.\nBoard Independence\nThe board of directors has determined that each of our directors, with the exception of directors O’Neil and Delory, is “independent” as\ndefined in, and for purposes of satisfying the listing standards of, the Nasdaq Stock Market. Director O’Neil is not independent because he is an\nexecutive officer of ECB Bancorp. Director Delory is not deemed independent because of fees paid to his law firm in connection with loan\nclosings for which Everett Co-operative Bank is the lender.\nIn determining the independence of the directors listed above, the board of directors considered relationships between Everett Co-operative\nBank and our directors and officers, none of which are required to be reported under “ – Transactions With Certain Related Persons” below,\nincluding loans and deposit accounts that our directors maintain at Everett Co-operative Bank.\nITEM 14.

The Executive agrees not to make any oral or written statement or take any other action that\ndisparages or criticizes the Company or the Bank or their management or practices, that damages the Company’s or the Bank’s good\nreputation, or that impairs the normal operations of the Company or the Bank.

To the extent necessary to ensure compliance with Code Section 409A (“Section 409A”), the provisions\nof this Section 24 shall govern in all cases over any contrary or conflicting provision in this Agreement.\n(a) It is intended that this Agreement comply with the requirements of Section 409A and all guidance issued thereunder by\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Service with respect to any nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A. This Agreement\nshall be interpreted and administered to maximize the exemptions from Section 409A and, to the extent this Agreement provides for\ndeferred compensation subject to Section 409A, to comply with Section 409A and to avoid the imposition of tax, interest and/or\npenalties upon Executive under Section 409A. The Company and the Bank do not, however, assume any economic burdens associated\nwith Section 409A. Although the Company and the Bank intend to administer this Agreement to prevent taxation under Section 409A,\nthey do not represent or warrant that this Agreement complies with any provision of federal, state, local, or non-United States law.\nThe Company, the Bank, other affiliates of the Bank, and their respective directors, officers, employees and advisers will not be liable\nto the Executive (or any other individual claiming a benefit through the Executive) for any tax, interest, or penalties the Executive\nmay owe as a result of this Agreement. Neither the Company, the Bank nor any other affiliate of the Company has any obligation to\nindemnify or otherwise protect the Executive from any obligation to pay taxes under Section 409A.\n(b)The right to a series of payments under this Agreement will be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. Each\npayment under this Agreement that is made within 2-1⁄\u0000 months following the end of the year that contains the Termination Date is\nintended to be exempt from\n15\nSection 409A as a short-term deferral within the meaning of the final regulations under Section 409A. Each payment under\nthis Agreement that is made later than 2-1⁄\u0000 months following the end of the year that contains the Termination Date is intended to be\nexempt from Section 409A under the two-times exception of Treasury Reg. § 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii), up to the limitation on the\navailability of that exception specified in the regulation. Then, each payment that is made after the two-times exception ceases to be\navailable shall be subject to delay, as necessary, as specified below.\n(c)To the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A, in no event may the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the\ntaxable year of payment. In particular, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A, if any payment to the Executive under\nthis Agreement is conditioned upon the Executive executing and not revoking a release of claims and if the designated payment\nperiod for such payment begins in one taxable year and ends in the next taxable year, the payment will be made in the later taxable\nyear.\n(d)To the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A, references in this Agreement to “termination of employment” or\n“terminates employment” (and similar references) shall have the same meaning as “separation from service” under Section 409A(a)\n(2)(A)(i) and any governing Internal Revenue Service guidance and Treasury regulations (“Separation from Service”), and no\npayment subject to Section 409A that is payable upon a termination of employment shall be paid unless and until (and not later than\napplicable in compliance with Section 409A) the Executive incurs a Separation from Service. In addition, if the Executive is a\n“specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) at the time of the Executive’s Separation from Service, any\nnonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A that would otherwise have been payable on account of, and within the\nfirst six months following, the Executive’s Separation from Service, and not by reason of another event under\nSection 409A(a)(2)(A), will become payable on the first business day after six months following the date of the Executive’s\nSeparation from Service or, if earlier, the date of the Executive’s death.\n(e)To the extent that any payment of or reimbursement by the Bank to the Executive of eligible expenses under this\nAgreement constitutes a “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A (a “Reimbursement”) (i) the Executive\nmust request the Reimbursement (with substantiation of the expense incurred) no later than 90 days following the date on which the\nExecutive incurs the corresponding eligible expense; (ii) subject to any shorter time period provided in any Bank expense\nreimbursement policy or specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement, the Bank shall make the Reimbursement to the Executive\non or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Executive incurred the eligible expense; (iii)\nthe Executive’s right to Reimbursement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit; (iv) the amount eligible\nfor Reimbursement in one calendar year shall not affect the amount eligible for Reimbursement in any other calendar year; and (v)\nexcept as specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement, the period during which the Executive may incur expenses that are\neligible for Reimbursement is limited to five calendar years following the calendar year in which the Termination Date occurs.\n16\n25. Miscellaneous Provisions.\n(a)Further Assurances. Each of the parties hereto shall do, execute, acknowledge, and deliver or cause to be done,\nexecuted, acknowledged, and delivered at any time and from time to time upon the request of any other party hereto, all such further\nacts, documents, and instruments as may be reasonably required to effect any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.\n(b)Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and\ntheir respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that neither party hereto may assign this Agreement without the prior\nwritten consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company or the Bank, as applicable, shall require any\nsuccessor or assign (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the\nbusiness or assets of the Company or the Bank, as applicable, to expressly assume, in writing, all of the Company’s or the Bank’s, as\napplicable, obligations to the Executive hereunder and the Executive hereby consents to the assignment of the Restrictive Covenants\nunder this Agreement to any successor or assign of the Company or the Bank, as applicable, and (ii) upon the Executive’s death, this\nAgreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive’s executors, administrators, representatives, heirs,\ndistributees, devisees, and legatees and all amounts payable hereunder shall be paid to such persons or the estate of the Executive.\n(c)Waiver; Amendment. No provision or obligation of this Agreement may be waived or discharged unless such waiver or\ndischarge is agreed to in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company and the Bank and the Executive. The waiver\nby any party hereto of a breach of or noncompliance with any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a\ncontinuing waiver or a waiver of any other or later breach or noncompliance. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, this\nAgreement may be amended or supplemented only by a written agreement executed by a duly authorized officer of the Company, a\nduly authorized officer of the Bank and the Executive.\n(d)Headings.
