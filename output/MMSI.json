These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period. For the same reasons, Merit is unable to address the significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results. Specifically, Merit is not, without unreasonable effort, able to reliably predict the impact of these items and Merit believes inclusion of a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to their GAAP counterparts could be confusing to investors or cause undue reliance.\n\nMerit’s financial guidance for the year ending December 31, 2024 is subject to risks and uncertainties identified in this release and Merit’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\n\n_CONFERENCE CALL_\n\nMerit will hold its investor conference call today, Wednesday, October 30, 2024, at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time. **To access the conference call, please pre-register using the following**[**link**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NGkzO0czEHEzT_MZyGtHvoMdDMhZUU2JLM3Ys46SpblLv6851DoTYPA8JJhxjgg834FCqRNuwEgnK71NfpAxmF4HJCPUIBVCU_pDXS--EuBz7zL7C76ySJDyyadPNKvK-UhMKjAdclVMCug-7qcMfih4wZRys007TSF8-oqrnfM=). **Registrants will receive confirmation with dial-in details.** A live webcast and slide deck will also be available at merit.com.\n\n_WRAPSODY CELL-IMPERMEABLE ENDOPROSTHESIS_\n\nThe Merit WRAPSODY Cell-Impermeable Endoprosthesis is not approved or available for commercial distribution in the United States and may not be approved or available for sale or use in other countries.

Financial Measures_\n\nAlthough Merit’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), Merit’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this release may provide investors with useful information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of Merit’s ongoing operations and can be useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. Non-GAAP financial measures used in this release include:\n\n  * constant currency revenue;\n  * constant currency revenue, organic;\n  * non-GAAP gross profit and margin;\n  * non-GAAP operating income and margin;\n  * non-GAAP net income;\n  * non-GAAP earnings per share; and\n  * free cash flow.\n\n\n\nMerit’s management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate Merit’s profitability and efficiency, to compare operating and financial results to prior periods, to evaluate changes in the results of its operating segments, and to measure and allocate financial resources internally. However, Merit’s management does not consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nReaders should consider non-GAAP measures used in this release in addition to, not as a substitute for, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures generally exclude some, but not all, items that may affect Merit’s net income. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which items are excluded. Merit believes it is useful to exclude such items in the calculation of non-GAAP gross profit and margin, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP earnings per share (in each case, as further illustrated in the reconciliation tables below) because such amounts in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of Merit’s business operations and can vary significantly between periods as a result of factors such as acquisition or other extraordinary transactions, non-cash expenses related to amortization or write-off of previously acquired tangible and intangible assets, certain employee termination benefits, expenses resulting from non-ordinary course litigation or administrative proceedings and resulting settlements, governmental proceedings or changes in tax or industry regulations, gains or losses on disposal of certain assets, and debt issuance costs. Merit may incur similar types of expenses in the future, and the non-GAAP financial information included in this release should not be viewed as a statement or indication that these types of expenses will not recur. Additionally, the non-GAAP financial measures used in this release may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Merit urges readers to review the reconciliations of its non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included herein, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Merit’s business or results of operations.\n\n_Constant Currency Revenue_\n\nMerit’s constant currency revenue is prepared by converting the current-period reported revenue of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar at the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior-year period and adjusting for the effects of hedging transactions on reported revenue, which are recorded in the U.S. dollar. The constant currency revenue adjustments of $0.3 million and $5.0 million to reported revenue for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were calculated using the applicable average foreign exchange rates for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023.\n\n_Constant Currency Revenue, Organic_\n\nMerit’s constant currency revenue, organic, is defined, with respect to prior fiscal year periods, as GAAP revenue. With respect to current fiscal year periods, constant currency revenue, organic, is defined as constant currency revenue (as defined above), less revenue from certain acquisitions. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, Merit’s constant currency revenue, organic, excludes revenues attributable to assets acquired from EndoGastric Solutions, Inc. (“EGS”) in July 2024. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, Merit’s constant currency revenue, organic, excludes revenues attributable to assets acquired from EGS in July 2024 as well as certain assets acquired from AngioDynamics, Inc. (“AngioDynamics”) in June 2023.\n\n_Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Margin_\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit is calculated by reducing GAAP cost of sales by amounts recorded for amortization of intangible assets and inventory mark-up related to acquisitions. Non-GAAP gross margin is calculated by dividing non-GAAP gross profit by reported net sales.\n\n_Non-GAAP_ _Operating Income and Margin_\n\nNon-GAAP operating income is calculated by adjusting GAAP operating income for certain items which are deemed by Merit’s management to be outside of core operations and vary in amount and frequency among periods, such as expenses related to acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions, non-cash expenses related to amortization or write-off of previously acquired tangible and intangible assets, certain employee termination benefits, performance-based stock compensation expenses, expenses resulting from non-ordinary course litigation or administrative proceedings and resulting settlements, governmental proceedings, and changes in governmental or industry regulations, as well as other items referenced in the tables below. Non-GAAP operating margin is calculated by dividing non-GAAP operating income by reported net sales.\n\n_Non-GAAP Net Income_\n\nNon-GAAP net income is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income for the items set forth in the definition of non-GAAP operating income above, as well as for expenses related to debt issuance costs and other items set forth in the tables below.\n\n_Non-GAAP EPS_\n\nNon-GAAP EPS is defined as non-GAAP net income divided by the diluted shares outstanding for the corresponding period.\n\n_Free Cash Flow_\n\nFree cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations calculated in accordance with GAAP, less capital expenditures for property and equipment calculated in accordance with GAAP, as set forth in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n_Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations_\n\nThe following tables set forth supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to Merit’s corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, in each case, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The non-GAAP income adjustments referenced in the following tables do not reflect non-performance-based stock compensation expense of approximately $3.1 million and $3.4 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and $9.6 million and $9.2 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income**(Unaudited, in thousands except per share amounts)\n\nThree Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024  \nPre-Tax| Tax Impact| After-Tax| Per Share Impact  \nGAAP net income| $| 36,657| $| (8,213| )| $| 28,444| $| 0.48  \n _Non-GAAP adjustments:_  \nCost of Sales  \nAmortization of intangibles| 14,896| (3,522| )| 11,374| 0.19  \nInventory mark-up related to acquisitions| 559| (132| )| 427| 0.01  \nOperating Expenses  \nContingent consideration expense| 103| (6| )| 97| 0.00  \nAmortization of intangibles| 2,038| (482| )| 1,556| 0.03  \nPerformance-based share-based compensation (b)| 3,736| (609| )| 3,127| 0.05  \nCorporate restructuring (c)| 2,084| (492| )| 1,592| 0.03  \nAcquisition-related| 2,351| (555| )| 1,796| 0.03  \nMedical Device Regulation expenses (d)| 1,983| (468| )| 1,515| 0.03  \nOther (e)| 125| (30| )| 95| 0.00  \nOther (Income) Expense  \nAmortization of long-term debt issuance costs| 1,477| (349| )| 1,128| 0.02  \nNon-GAAP net income| $| 66,009| $| (14,858| )| $| 51,151| $| 0.86  \nDiluted shares| 59,537  \n  \nThree Months Ended  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2023 (a)  \nPre-Tax| Tax Impact| After-Tax| Per Share Impact  \nGAAP net income| $| 30,222| $| (4,388| )| $| 25,834| $| 0.44  \n _Non-GAAP adjustments:_  \nCost of Sales  \nAmortization of intangibles| 13,120| (3,154| )| 9,966| 0.17  \nInventory mark-up related to acquisitions| 1,741| (418| )| 1,323| 0.02  \nOperating Expenses  \nContingent consideration expense| 562| (123| )| 439| 0.01  \nAmortization of intangibles| 2,329| (560| )| 1,769| 0.03  \nPerformance-based share-based compensation (b)| 2,403| (344| )| 2,059| 0.04  \nAcquisition-related| 107| (26| )| 81| 0.00  \nMedical Device Regulation expenses (d)| 2,444| (587| )| 1,857| 0.03  \nOther (e)| (2,946| )| 707| (2,239| )| (0.04| )  \nOther (Income) Expense  \nAmortization of long-term debt issuance costs| 425| (102| )| 323| 0.01  \nNon-GAAP net income| $| 50,407| $| (8,995| )| $| 41,412| $| 0.71  \nDiluted shares| 58,375  \n  \n___________________________\n\nNote: Certain per-share impacts may not sum to totals due to rounding.\n\n**Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income**(Unaudited;

As a result, our non-GAAP financial measures for prior periods have been recast for comparability. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, our non-GAAP financial measures have been updated to no longer adjust $2.8 million for consulting fees under our FFG Program and the related income tax effect. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our non-GAAP financial measures have been updated to no longer adjust $1.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively, for consulting fees under our FFG Program and the related income tax effects. As of December 31, 2023, we completed the final year of our FFG Program.  \n---|---  \n(b)| Represents performance-based share-based compensation expense, including stock-settled and cash-settled awards.  \n(c)| Includes $2.1 million and $2.0 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, for employee termination benefits associated with activities related to corporate restructuring initiatives primarily for the integration of our acquisition of EGS. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, includes employee termination benefits associated with restructuring activities related to corporate initiatives of $2.9 million and includes $4.3 million for the write-off of other long-term assets associated with the divestiture or exit of certain businesses or product lines.  \n(d)| Represents incremental expenses incurred to comply with the E.U.
