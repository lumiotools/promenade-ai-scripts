Results compared with the same period last year were as follows: \n\n**For the three months ended**  \n---  \n**August 31,** |  **August 31,**  \n**In millions, except per share amounts** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Change(2)**  \nTotal revenue  |  $  |  1,318.5  |  $  |  1,286.0  |  3  |  %   \nOperating income  |  $  |  546.7  |  $  |  536.3  |  2  |  %   \nDiluted earnings per share  |  $  |  1.18  |  $  |  1.16  |  2  |  %   \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share(1) |  $  |  1.16  |  $  |  1.14  |  2  |  %   \n(1) |  Adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a United States (\"U.S.\") generally accepted accounting principle (\"GAAP\") measure. Please refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section on page 3 of this press release for a discussion of non-GAAP measures.   \n---|---  \n(2) |  Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.   \n  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, John Gibson commented, \"We are off to a solid start in fiscal 2025 with 3% growth in total revenue during the first quarter. Excluding the impact of the expiration of the Employee Retention Tax Credit (\"ERTC\") program and one less payroll processing day, revenue growth was 7%. Despite these headwinds, we delivered earnings per share growth in the first quarter through strong expense discipline.\" \n\nMr. Gibson also noted, \"Small and mid-sized businesses remain resilient as the U.S. labor market gradually returns to its pre-pandemic level and wage inflation continues to moderate. We continue to invest in our go to market capabilities and products to drive innovation to meet the realities of the post-pandemic marketplace. We are excited to announce the introduction of several new products: Paychex Flex® Engage, Paychex Flex Perks, and Paychex Recruiting Copilot. These digital and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") driven solutions are designed to help our clients attract, retain, and engage their most critical asset, their workforce, and will strengthen our ability to achieve our mission to help businesses succeed.\" \n\n**First Quarter Business Highlights**\n\nTotal revenue increased to $1.3 billion for the first quarter, growth of 3% over the prior year period. Highlights as compared with the corresponding prior year period are as follows: \n\n  * Management Solutions revenue increased 1% to $961.7 million for the first quarter primarily impacted by the following factors: \n    * Growth in the number of clients served across our suite of human capital management (\"HCM\") solutions and client worksite employees for Human Resources (\"HR\") Solutions; \n    * Higher product penetration, including HR Solutions and Retirement; and \n    * Lower revenue from ancillary services, primarily due to the expiration of our ERTC Service. \n\n\n  * Professional Employer Organization (\"PEO\") and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 7% to $319.3 million for the first quarter primarily due to the following: \n    * Growth in the number of average PEO worksite employees; and \n    * Increase in PEO insurance revenues. \n\n\n  * Interest on funds held for clients increased 15% to $37.5 million for the first quarter primarily due to higher average interest rates and average investment balances. \n\n\n\nTotal expenses increased 3% to $771.8 million for the first quarter primarily due to the following: \n\n  * Increase in PEO direct insurance costs related to growth in average worksite employees and PEO insurance revenues; and \n  * Continued investment in technology, sales, and marketing. \n\n\n\nOperating income grew 2% to $546.7 million for the first quarter. Operating margin (operating income as a percentage of total revenue) was 41.5% for the first quarter compared to 41.7% for the prior year period. Operating income was impacted by the expiration of the ERTC program and one less payroll processing day as compared with the prior year quarter. \n\nOther income, net decreased 19% to $10.4 million for the first quarter primarily as a result of lower average investment balances on our corporate investments. \n\nOur effective income tax rate was 23.3% for the first quarter compared to 23.7% for the prior year period. Both periods were impacted by the recognition of net discrete tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments. \n\nDiluted earnings per share increased 2% to $1.18 per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share(1) increased 2% to $1.16 for the first quarter. \n\n(1) |  Adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a U.S. GAAP measure. Please refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section on page 3 of this press release for a discussion of non-GAAP measures.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Financial Position and Liquidity**\n\nOur financial position and cash flow generation remained strong during the first three months of the fiscal year. As of August 31, 2024, we had: \n\n  * Cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $1.6 billion. \n  * Short-term and long-term borrowings, net of debt issuance costs, of $817.6 million. \n  * Cash flow from operations was $546.1 million for the first quarter. \n\n\n\n**Return to Stockholders During the First Quarter**\n\n  * Paid cumulative dividends of $0.98 per share totaling $353.4 million. \n  * Repurchased 828,855 shares of our common stock for $104.0 million. \n\n\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\n**For the three months ended**  \n---  \n**August 31,** |  **August 31,**  \n**$ in millions** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Change**  \nNet income  |  $  |  427.4  |  $  |  419.2  |  2  |  %   \nNon-GAAP adjustments:   \nExcess tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments(1) |  (6.2  |  )  |  (4.1  |  )   \nAdjusted net income  |  $  |  421.2  |  $  |  415.1  |  1  |  %   \nDiluted earnings per share(2) |  $  |  1.18  |  $  |  1.16  |  2  |  %   \nNon-GAAP adjustments:   \nExcess tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments(1) |  (0.02  |  )  |  (0.01  |  )   \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share  |  $  |  1.16  |  $  |  1.14  |  2  |  %   \nNet income  |  $  |  427.4  |  $  |  419.2  |  2  |  %   \nNon-GAAP adjustments:   \nInterest income, net  |  (10.3  |  )  |  (12.1  |  )   \nIncome taxes  |  129.7  |  129.9   \nDepreciation and amortization expense  |  39.0  |  41.2   \nTotal non-GAAP adjustments  |  158.4  |  159.0   \nEBITDA  |  $  |  585.8  |  $  |  578.2  |  1  |  %   \n(1) |  Net tax windfall benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments recognized in income taxes. This item is subject to volatility and will vary based on employee decisions on exercising employee stock options and fluctuations in our stock price, neither of which is within the control of management.   \n---|---  \n(2) |  The calculation of the impact of non-GAAP adjustments on diluted earnings per share is performed on each line independently. The table may not add down by +/- $0.01 due to rounding.   \n  \nIn addition to reporting net income and diluted earnings per share, which are U.S. GAAP measures, we present adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), which are non-GAAP measures. We believe these additional measures are indicators of the performance of our core business operations period over period. Adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and EBITDA are not calculated through the application of U.S. GAAP and are not required forms of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). As such, they should not be considered a substitute for the U.S. GAAP measures of net income, and diluted earnings per share, and, therefore, they should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies. \n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nOur business outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025 (\"fiscal 2025\") incorporates current assumptions and market conditions. Changes in the macroeconomic environment could alter our guidance. With consideration of these impacts, we have updated our business outlook as follows: \n\n  * Interest on funds held for clients is now anticipated to be in the range of $145 million to $155 million. \n  * Other income, net is now anticipated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million. \n  * Other aspects of our guidance for fiscal 2025 remain unchanged from what we provided previously. \n\n\n\n**Corporate Responsibility**\n\nAs part of what it means to be Paychex, we are focusing our corporate responsibility efforts on actions we can take to create positive impact.

Results compared with the same period last year were as follows: \n\n**For the three months ended**  \n---  \n**August 31,** |  **August 31,**  \n**In millions, except per share amounts** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Change(2)**  \nTotal revenue  |  $  |  1,318.5  |  $  |  1,286.0  |  3  |  %   \nOperating income  |  $  |  546.7  |  $  |  536.3  |  2  |  %   \nDiluted earnings per share  |  $  |  1.18  |  $  |  1.16  |  2  |  %   \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share(1) |  $  |  1.16  |  $  |  1.14  |  2  |  %   \n(1) |  Adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a United States (\"U.S.\") generally accepted accounting principle (\"GAAP\") measure. Please refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section on page 3 of this press release for a discussion of non-GAAP measures.   \n---|---  \n(2) |  Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.   \n  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, John Gibson commented, \"We are off to a solid start in fiscal 2025 with 3% growth in total revenue during the first quarter. Excluding the impact of the expiration of the Employee Retention Tax Credit (\"ERTC\") program and one less payroll processing day, revenue growth was 7%. Despite these headwinds, we delivered earnings per share growth in the first quarter through strong expense discipline.\" \n\nMr. Gibson also noted, \"Small and mid-sized businesses remain resilient as the U.S. labor market gradually returns to its pre-pandemic level and wage inflation continues to moderate. We continue to invest in our go to market capabilities and products to drive innovation to meet the realities of the post-pandemic marketplace. We are excited to announce the introduction of several new products: Paychex Flex® Engage, Paychex Flex Perks, and Paychex Recruiting Copilot. These digital and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") driven solutions are designed to help our clients attract, retain, and engage their most critical asset, their workforce, and will strengthen our ability to achieve our mission to help businesses succeed.\" \n\n**First Quarter Business Highlights**\n\nTotal revenue increased to $1.3 billion for the first quarter, growth of 3% over the prior year period. Highlights as compared with the corresponding prior year period are as follows: \n\n  * Management Solutions revenue increased 1% to $961.7 million for the first quarter primarily impacted by the following factors: \n    * Growth in the number of clients served across our suite of human capital management (\"HCM\") solutions and client worksite employees for Human Resources (\"HR\") Solutions; \n    * Higher product penetration, including HR Solutions and Retirement; and \n    * Lower revenue from ancillary services, primarily due to the expiration of our ERTC Service. \n\n\n  * Professional Employer Organization (\"PEO\") and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 7% to $319.3 million for the first quarter primarily due to the following: \n    * Growth in the number of average PEO worksite employees; and \n    * Increase in PEO insurance revenues. \n\n\n  * Interest on funds held for clients increased 15% to $37.5 million for the first quarter primarily due to higher average interest rates and average investment balances. \n\n\n\nTotal expenses increased 3% to $771.8 million for the first quarter primarily due to the following: \n\n  * Increase in PEO direct insurance costs related to growth in average worksite employees and PEO insurance revenues; and \n  * Continued investment in technology, sales, and marketing. \n\n\n\nOperating income grew 2% to $546.7 million for the first quarter. Operating margin (operating income as a percentage of total revenue) was 41.5% for the first quarter compared to 41.7% for the prior year period. Operating income was impacted by the expiration of the ERTC program and one less payroll processing day as compared with the prior year quarter. \n\nOther income, net decreased 19% to $10.4 million for the first quarter primarily as a result of lower average investment balances on our corporate investments. \n\nOur effective income tax rate was 23.3% for the first quarter compared to 23.7% for the prior year period. Both periods were impacted by the recognition of net discrete tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments. \n\nDiluted earnings per share increased 2% to $1.18 per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share(1) increased 2% to $1.16 for the first quarter. \n\n(1) |  Adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a U.S. GAAP measure. Please refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section on page 3 of this press release for a discussion of non-GAAP measures.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Financial Position and Liquidity**\n\nOur financial position and cash flow generation remained strong during the first three months of the fiscal year. As of August 31, 2024, we had: \n\n  * Cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $1.6 billion. \n  * Short-term and long-term borrowings, net of debt issuance costs, of $817.6 million. \n  * Cash flow from operations was $546.1 million for the first quarter. \n\n\n\n**Return to Stockholders During the First Quarter**\n\n  * Paid cumulative dividends of $0.98 per share totaling $353.4 million. \n  * Repurchased 828,855 shares of our common stock for $104.0 million. \n\n\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\n**For the three months ended**  \n---  \n**August 31,** |  **August 31,**  \n**$ in millions** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Change**  \nNet income  |  $  |  427.4  |  $  |  419.2  |  2  |  %   \nNon-GAAP adjustments:   \nExcess tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments(1) |  (6.2  |  )  |  (4.1  |  )   \nAdjusted net income  |  $  |  421.2  |  $  |  415.1  |  1  |  %   \nDiluted earnings per share(2) |  $  |  1.18  |  $  |  1.16  |  2  |  %   \nNon-GAAP adjustments:   \nExcess tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments(1) |  (0.02  |  )  |  (0.01  |  )   \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share  |  $  |  1.16  |  $  |  1.14  |  2  |  %   \nNet income  |  $  |  427.4  |  $  |  419.2  |  2  |  %   \nNon-GAAP adjustments:   \nInterest income, net  |  (10.3  |  )  |  (12.1  |  )   \nIncome taxes  |  129.7  |  129.9   \nDepreciation and amortization expense  |  39.0  |  41.2   \nTotal non-GAAP adjustments  |  158.4  |  159.0   \nEBITDA  |  $  |  585.8  |  $  |  578.2  |  1  |  %   \n(1) |  Net tax windfall benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments recognized in income taxes. This item is subject to volatility and will vary based on employee decisions on exercising employee stock options and fluctuations in our stock price, neither of which is within the control of management.   \n---|---  \n(2) |  The calculation of the impact of non-GAAP adjustments on diluted earnings per share is performed on each line independently. The table may not add down by +/- $0.01 due to rounding.   \n  \nIn addition to reporting net income and diluted earnings per share, which are U.S. GAAP measures, we present adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), which are non-GAAP measures. We believe these additional measures are indicators of the performance of our core business operations period over period. Adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and EBITDA are not calculated through the application of U.S. GAAP and are not required forms of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). As such, they should not be considered a substitute for the U.S. GAAP measures of net income, and diluted earnings per share, and, therefore, they should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies. \n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nOur business outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025 (\"fiscal 2025\") incorporates current assumptions and market conditions. Changes in the macroeconomic environment could alter our guidance. With consideration of these impacts, we have updated our business outlook as follows: \n\n  * Interest on funds held for clients is now anticipated to be in the range of $145 million to $155 million. \n  * Other income, net is now anticipated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million. \n  * Other aspects of our guidance for fiscal 2025 remain unchanged from what we provided previously. \n\n\n\n**Corporate Responsibility**\n\nAs part of what it means to be Paychex, we are focusing our corporate responsibility efforts on actions we can take to create positive impact.
