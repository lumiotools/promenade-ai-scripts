The topline 52-week safety data from the ENLIGHTEN 1 safety extension study was in-line with the primary treatment phase, with no product-related serious adverse events, including for those patients that received a repeat dose, resulting in a 12-month treatment period. We are anticipating additional data from the ENLIGHTEN 1 safety extension study in the coming months, which will be presented at an upcoming medical conference, as well as topline results from the ENLIGHTEN 2 pivotal trial expected in Q2 2025,” said Maria Palasis, Ph.D., President and CEO of Lyra Therapeutics.\n\nDr. Palasis continued, “We eagerly await the upcoming data readouts, and they will guide us in making data-driven evaluations as we determine the potential path for LYR-210 to add value for CRS patients, investors and other stakeholders.”\n\nThe ENLIGHTEN program consists of two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, ENLIGHTEN 1 and ENLIGHTEN 2, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LYR-210 for the treatment of CRS. Each ENLIGHTEN trial has enrolled approximately 180 CRS patients who have failed medical management and have not had prior ethmoid sinus surgery, randomized 2:1 to either LYR-210 (7500µg mometasone furoate) or sham control for 24 weeks.\n\n**Topline Results from the ENLIGHTEN 1 52-week extension study**\n\nToday, Lyra reported topline 52-week safety data from the ENLIGHTEN 1 safety extension study:\n\n  * Safety data for LYR-210 was generally consistent with the 24-week primary treatment phase, including for those patients that received a repeat dosing, resulting in a 12-month treatment period.\n  * LYR-210 was generally well tolerated, with no product-related serious adverse events. The most commonly reported adverse events in the study population were chronic sinusitis, nasal odor, epistaxis, sinusitis, and nasopharyngitis.\n\n\n\n**Clinical Program Highlights**\n\n**Enrollment in ENLIGHTEN 2 completed**\n\n  * In October 2024, Lyra announced that the pivotal Phase 3 ENLIGHTEN 2 clinical trial of LYR-210 in adult patients with CRS who have not had prior ethmoid sinus surgery, was fully enrolled, achieving the expected enrollment timeframe of second half of 2024.\n\n\n\n**Milestones for Ongoing ENLIGHTEN Pivotal Program of LYR-210 in CRS**\n\n  * Topline results from ENLIGHTEN 2 are expected in Q2 2025.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 were $51.6 million, compared with $67.5 million at June 30, 2024. Based on our current business plan, we anticipate that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balance is sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures into the first quarter of 2026. \n\nResearch and development expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $5.9 million compared to $12.4 million for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of $6.5 million. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a $3.8 million decrease in clinical related costs as we completed both the BEACON trial for LYR-220 and the primary study phase of the ENLIGHTEN 1 trial for LYR-210, a decrease of $2.5 million in employee related costs primarily driven by the reduction in force which occurred in May 2024, a decrease in professional and consulting costs of $0.4 million and a decrease in product development and manufacturing costs of $0.4 million. This decrease in costs was partially offset by an increase in allocated costs and depreciation of $0.6 million. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 were $3.9 million compared to $5.0 million for the same period in 2023, representing a decrease of $1.1 million. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in professional and consulting fees of $1.0 million as we scaled back activities subsequent to announcing in May 2024 that the ENLIGHTEN 1 trial did not meet its primary endpoint, in addition to a decrease in employee related costs of $0.5 million primarily due to the reduction in force which occurred in May 2024. These cost decreases were partially offset by an increase in allocation and support costs of $0.4 million primarily due to the increased rent and facilities expenses for the Company’s three leased facilities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nNet loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $11.9 million compared to $15.7 million for the same period in 2023. \n\n**LYRA THERAPEUTICS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS** **(unaudited)** **(in thousands, except share and per share data)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nCollaboration revenue| $| 195| $| 544| $| 1,325| $| 1,412  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development| 5,902| 12,368| 37,404| 35,763  \nGeneral and administrative| 3,931| 5,003| 14,888| 14,700  \nImpairment of property and equipment| —| —| 1,883| 1,592  \nImpairment of right-of-use assets| —| —| 22,836| —  \nRestructuring and other related charges| 2,804| —| 9,254| —  \nTotal operating expenses| 12,637| 17,371| 86,265| 52,055  \nLoss from operations| (12,442| )| (16,827| )| (84,940| )| (50,643| )  \nOther income:  \nInterest income| 576| 1,192| 2,517| 3,161  \nTotal other income| 576| 1,192| 2,517| 3,161  \nLoss before income tax expense| (11,866| )| (15,635| )| (82,423| )| (47,482| )  \nIncome tax expense| (7| )| (16| )| (33| )| (42| )  \nNet loss| (11,873| )| (15,651| )| (82,456| )| (47,524| )  \nOther comprehensive loss:  \nUnrealized holding gain (loss) on short-term investments, net of tax| 24| 20| (13| )| (17| )  \nComprehensive loss| $| (11,849| )| $| (15,631| )| $| (82,469| )| $| (47,541| )  \nNet loss per share attributable to common stockholders— basic and diluted| $| (0.18| )| $| (0.27| )| $| (1.27| )| $| (1.04| )  \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding— basic and diluted| 65,456,735| 56,953,685| 64,981,219| 45,894,643  \n**LYRA THERAPEUTICS, INC.** **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS** **(unaudited)** **(in thousands, except share data)**  \n---  \n**September 30,**| **December 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 23,800| $| 22,353  \nShort-term investments| 27,826| 80,400  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets| 2,818| 2,068  \nTotal current assets| 54,444| 104,821  \nProperty and equipment, net| 1,613| 2,043  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets| 20,707| 33,233  \nRestricted cash| 1,992| 1,392  \nOther assets| —| 1,111  \nTotal assets| $| 78,756| $| 142,600  \n**Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity**  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable| $| 2,292| $| 3,131  \nRestructuring liability| 4,855| —  \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities| 3,197| 9,374  \nOperating lease liabilities| 4,003| 5,434  \nDeferred revenue| 607| 1,658  \nTotal current liabilities| 14,954| 19,597  \nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion| 31,321| 21,447  \nDeferred revenue, net of current portion| 11,862| 12,136  \nTotal liabilities| 58,137| 53,180  \nCommitments and contingencies  \nStockholders’ equity:  \nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value, 10,000,000 shares authorized at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023; no shares issued and outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023| —| —  \nCommon stock, $0.001 par value; 200,000,000 shares authorized at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023; 65,456,735 and 57,214,550 shares issued and outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively| 65| 57  \nAdditional paid-in capital| 414,345| 400,685  \nAccumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax| 20| 33  \nAccumulated deficit| (393,811| )| (311,355| )  \nTotal stockholders’ equity| 20,619| 89,420  \nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity| $| 78,756| $| 142,600  \n  \n**About LYR-210** LYR-210 is an investigational product candidate for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in patients who have failed current therapies and require further intervention.

Lyra Therapeutics is developing therapies for CRS, a highly prevalent inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses which leads to debilitating symptoms and significant morbidities. LYR-210, the company’s lead product, is a bioabsorbable nasal implant designed to be administered in a simple, in-office procedure and is intended to deliver six months of continuous anti-inflammatory drug therapy (7500µg mometasone furoate) to the sinonasal passages for the treatment of CRS with a single administration. LYR-210, being evaluated in the ENLIGHTEN Phase 3 clinical program, is intended for patients with standard anatomy, primarily patients who have not undergone ethmoid sinus surgery. The company’s therapies are intended to treat the estimated four million CRS patients in the United States who fail medical management each year.
