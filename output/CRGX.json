(NASDAQ: CRGX)** , a clinical-stage biotechnology company positioned to advance next-generation, potentially curative cell therapies for cancer patients, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\n\n“We are pleased to report another quarter of strong execution underscored by continued progress in our FIRCE-1, Phase 2 study of firi-cel in addition to meaningful pipeline advancements,” said Gina Chapman, President and Chief Executive Officer of CARGO. “With 57 patients dosed and continued, strong manufacturing success, we remain on track to report our interim analysis in the first half of 2025. We also anticipate a clear path forward to advancing CRG-023, our innovative tri-specific CAR T product candidate, into the clinic following our successful pre-IND meeting with the FDA and we are excited to share more at the upcoming ASH meeting.”\n\nChapman continued, “I’d also like to recognize Anup Radhakrishnan on his appointment to Chief Operating Officer in addition to his current role as CFO. Anup has been instrumental in transforming CARGO from a private to public company, including establishing and scaling our corporate infrastructure, achieving operational excellence, leading our successful IPO, and overseeing our corporate and capital formation strategies. His leadership over the years has not only enabled our progress and execution across our programs but also positioned CARGO for future growth.”\n\n**Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * **Firi-cel:**\n    * Currently 57 patients have been dosed across all cohorts with strong manufacturing success in the FIRCE-1, Phase 2 clinical study of firi-cel in patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) whose disease relapsed or was refractory (R/R) to CD19 CAR T-cell therapy.\n    * The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) completed its safety and futility assessment during the third quarter and recommended the continuation of the FIRCE-1 study without modification.\n    * CARGO expects to complete its interim analysis and report the results in the first half of 2025.\n  * **CRG-023:**\n    * During the third quarter, CARGO completed a successful pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) meeting with the FDA, obtaining guidance on the development program and the data package to be provided in the IND.\n    * IND application submission for CRG-023 in Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma anticipated in the first quarter of 2025; first patient dosed planned for 2025.\n    * CARGO will present CRG-023 pre-clinical data at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. The abstract cites CRG-023 construct design as well as pre-clinical data demonstrating durable anti-tumor activity following repeated challenge from tumor cells expressing all three antigens (CD19, CD20, CD22), sustained tumor clearance when only a single antigen is expressed, and robust in vivo, anti-lymphoma activity in low CAR T dose levels.\n  * **Corporate:**\n    * CARGO today announced the appointment of Anup Radhakrishnan, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO. In this role, Mr. Radhakrishnan will continue to oversee CARGO's financial and business strategy, while also providing operational leadership to drive the execution of CARGO's strategic goals across the enterprise.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Cash Position** : As of September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $404.8 million, which we believe will be sufficient to fund our expected operations through 2026.\n  * **Research and Development (R &D) Expenses**: R&D expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $35.9 million and $103.9 million, respectively, which included $1.9 million and $5.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, respectively.\n  * **General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses**: G&A expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $11.2 million and $33.3 million, respectively, which included $3.0 million and $7.9 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, respectively.\n  * **Net Loss** : Net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $41.9 million, or $0.88 per share, and $122.1 million, or $2.77 per share, respectively, including non-cash stock-based compensation of $4.9 million and $13.1 million, respectively.\n\n\n\n**About CARGO Therapeutics** CARGO Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company positioned to advance next- generation, potentially curative cell therapies for cancer patients. CARGO’s programs, platform technologies, and manufacturing strategy are designed to directly address the limitations of approved cell therapies, including limited durability of effect, safety concerns and unreliable supply. CARGO is currently evaluating firicabtagene autoleucel (firi-cel), an autologous CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy candidate, in a potentially pivotal Phase 2 clinical study in patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) whose disease relapsed or was refractory (R/R) to CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. CARGO has developed proprietary cell engineering platform technologies which it leverages to develop a pipeline of programs that incorporate multiple transgene therapeutic “cargo” designed to enhance CAR T-cell persistence and trafficking to tumor lesions, as well as to help safeguard against tumor resistance and T-cell exhaustion. This includes the CRG-023 program, which incorporates a novel tri-specific CAR T with CD2 co-stimulation that is designed to provide more patients across a broad range of B-cell malignancies with durable responses by addressing several known causes of relapse, resulting in a potential best-in-class CAR T-cell therapy. CARGO’s leadership and team have significant experience in developing, engineering, manufacturing, and commercializing oncology and cell therapy products.

The advancement of CRG-023 underscores our sophisticated cell-engineering capabilities and importantly, our pipeline potential in next-generation CAR T-cell therapies that are designed to deliver multiple, therapeutically beneficial transgene “cargo” from a single vector,” said Gina Chapman, President and Chief Executive Officer of CARGO Therapeutics. “CRG-023 is the culmination of a rigorous two-year effort and squarely in line with our mission to develop best-in-class, and potentially curative CAR T-cell therapies for patients with cancer. Based on the encouraging pre-clinical data, we are actively preparing for an IND submission.”\n\nCRG-023 is designed with the goal of providing more patients with durable responses by addressing several known causes of relapse associated with existing CAR T-cell therapies, such as tumor antigen loss (e.g., CD19), loss of co-stimulation (e.g., CD58) and T-cell exhaustion. CRG-023 is a first of its kind CAR T product candidate with a construct that targets three B-cell lineage antigens (CD19, CD20, and CD22) via three separately expressed CARs. For the CD19 and CD20 CARs, new scFv binders were selected for optimal CAR-mediated activity following an extensive antibody discovery and screening campaign. Each CAR has a CD3ζ signaling domain and a distinct co-stimulatory domain. The CD20 CAR design, which incorporates a CD2 costimulatory domain, was informed by observations that CD58 expression loss is associated with poor response outcomes to CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Intentional engineering and optimization of the final construct sought to limit onset of functional T-cell exhaustion and to sustain performance across a range of antigen expression profiles in order to prevent antigen escape.\n\n“CAR T therapy has been curative for some but not all who are afflicted with certain lymphomas, leukemias and multiple myeloma,” said Michael Ports, Chief Scientific Officer of CARGO Therapeutics. “Knowledge is increasing about mechanisms that contribute to poor outcomes to cell therapy. At CARGO, we apply this knowledge to the holistic design of CARs and to other engineered transgenes to advance the potential of cell therapies. For CRG-023, our team optimized components of each CAR, including selection of new binders and incorporation of CD2 co-stimulation to limit onset of T-cell exhaustion that may affect outcomes in high disease burden patients. To address antigen escape, three optimally designed CARs were then engineered into a tri-cistronic construct. Importantly, each individual CAR in the tri-cistronic format independently sustained meaningful anti-tumor activity when only a single antigen was expressed. We are encouraged by the mechanistic insights that will be presented by our team at ASH, and we look forward to translating these results to the clinic.”\n\nThe abstract reviews the CRG-023 construct design, including the discovery of novel CD19 and CD20 scFv binders, selected for enhanced CAR performance, that were combined with the existing CD22 scFv binder used in firicabtagene autoleucel (firi-cel). The iterative engineering of the construct allowed for the selection of the optimal costimulatory domain configuration and optimal assemblage in a unique tri-cistronic lentiviral vector designed to maximize durable anti-tumor response. Importantly, in these mouse models, CRG-023 CAR T cells were able to sustain durable _in vitro_ anti-tumor activity despite repeated tumor challenge against tumor cells expressing all or any one of the three antigens. Superior tumor control was observed as compared to benchmark CAR T cells, without increased cytokine secretion and while sustaining a less effector-differentiated phenotype. _In vivo_ studies showed that CRG-023 CAR T cells were highly active and able to clear Raji lymphoma tumor cells expressing the three target antigens in a dose-response manner and down to the lowest dose tested (1x105 CAR+ cells). Additionally, the data showed that CRG-023 T cells were able to durably clear tumor cells in models mimicking antigen loss in contrast to mono-CAR T cells such as FMC63-containing CD19 CAR T cells.\n\nThe ASH abstract is now available at [_www.hematology.org_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=X6LfZzhBxVlg97ADnTWUmcMjSDDbYAm_yiGFgK8bGhJS7hdf5NS2UvYElx27JjCRrenE8gIhJGwcIPLLOxwyN5-dkBDslgUhcE3OJ6-q_GFjMHoMMDPqnVkKAsrM_DzYjlFuUfnHu0t1UnF_0RHKng==).

CARGO’s programs, platform technologies, and manufacturing strategy are designed to directly address the limitations of approved cell therapies, including limited durability of effect, safety concerns and unreliable supply. CARGO is currently evaluating firicabtagene autoleucel (firi-cel), an autologous CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy candidate, in a potentially pivotal Phase 2 clinical study in patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) whose disease relapsed or was refractory (R/R) to CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. CARGO has developed proprietary cell engineering platform technologies which it leverages to develop a pipeline of programs that incorporate multiple transgene therapeutic “cargo” designed to enhance CAR T-cell persistence. This includes the CRG-023 program, which incorporates a novel tri-specific CAR T with CD2 co-stimulation that is designed to provide more durable responses for patients with a broad range of B-cell malignancies by addressing several known causes of relapse, resulting in a potential best-in-class CAR T-cell therapy. CARGO’s leadership and team have significant experience in developing, engineering, manufacturing, and commercializing oncology and cell therapy products.

One co-stimulatory domain incorporates CD2 signaling into the tri-specific CAR T cell, the design of which has been informed by immune-evasion and CAR T cell resistance mediated by the loss of CD58 (the ligand of the CD2 co-stimulatory receptor). Importantly, CRG-023 incorporates new, human scFVs binders from an extensive antibody discovery and screening campaign for both CD19 and CD20. The CD22-targeting CAR employs the human scFv m971 used in firicabtagene autoleucel, firi-cel. CARGO is currently advancing the program to IND.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
