Additionally, a handful of our larger accounts exhibited slower-than-usual ordering patterns, as demonstrated by a slight decrease in same-site sales. We continue to push forward with actions designed to mitigate the reduction in programmatic reorders, as outlined during our previous earnings call.”\n\nMr. Banks continued, “While Nephros prepares to launch digital support for filter installation, we are ramping up our service capabilities to foster installation commissions and complement filter sales.

An excerpt of the release is included below.\n\n> “****The results this quarter reinforce our perspective following Q1, and reflect continued progress within our regular, programmatic business…** ”** said Robert Banks, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n“The team has done a great job at securing new business with over 300 new accounts added in the past 12 months. This expansion represents an 8% increase year-over-year in programmatic, non-emergency response sales, outpacing the growth of the market,” Robert Banks added, “In contrast, we have observed a decline in the emergency response business, leading to muted overall revenue. We believe that one contributor to this shift is the reduced stringency of waterborne risk response in territories previously committed to both proactive filtration measures and robust corrective actions.”\n\nRobert Banks continued, “While Nephros is growing its active customer sites faster than ever, a portion of our user base is failing to maintain filter changeout schedules, subsequently leading to inconsistent reorders. Such facilities are challenged by a variety of factors, including reduced labor forces and lengthy processes for purchasing approval. In order to respond, Nephros continues to develop a variety of new business models such as digital support, automatic replenishment, and the bundling of services with filter purchases.”\n\n[Keep reading…](https://www.nephros.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Q2-2024-0808_PR-Nephros-Earnings-Release_FINAL.pdf)\n\n[![Collage of charts and graphs with blue replay icon overlaying the image\n](https://www.nephros.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ConferenceCallReplay_square.jpg)](https://www.nephros.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Nephros_20240808_430PME.mp3)Play recording of the Nephros Q2 2024 Conference Call\n\n## Learn More About Nephros\n\nPrevious  Next \n\n[ ![water hitting the ground](https://www.nephros.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iStock-530936826.jpg) Our Story ](https://www.nephros.com/about/)\n\n[ ![Diverse business team at meeting](https://www.nephros.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iStock-1069974378.jpg) Leadership ](https://www.nephros.com/about/leadership/)\n\n[ ![running water faucet](https://www.nephros.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iStock-175426122.jpg) How We Help ](https://www.nephros.com/services/)\n\nClose\n\n## Contact Us\n\nName(Required)\n\nFirst Last\n\nEmail(Required)\n\nCompany(Required)\n\nState(Required)\n\nSelectAlabamaAlaskaArizonaArkansasCaliforniaColoradoConnecticutDelawareDistrict of ColumbiaFloridaGeorgiaHawaiiIdahoIllinoisIndianaIowaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMaineMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMinnesotaMississippiMissouriMontanaNebraskaNevadaNew HampshireNew JerseyNew MexicoNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaOhioOklahomaOregonPennsylvaniaRhode IslandSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaTennesseeTexasUtahVermontVirginiaWashingtonWest VirginiaWisconsinWyomingOther\n\nPhone\n\nMessage\n\nCAPTCHA\n\nSubmit\n\nΔ\n\nNotifications\n"

With this foundation, we are judiciously investing in the development of enhanced capabilities to extend our competitive advantages to address water quality and safety challenges.”\n\n“We have taken an exciting step forward with the creation of an online filter tracker. This advancement will allow customers to more easily manage their Nephros filters with automated replacement reminders and documentation of installation and inventory. These features are just the beginning – we will continue to explore ways of creating and capturing value in the digital space” remarked Mr. Banks. “Additionally, Nephros is exploring how to best support those in need of nano and microplastic (NMP) filtration. With our ability to retain microorganisms with the smallest pore size on the market, we are uniquely suited to address NMPs, especially nanoplastics ”\n\n[Keep reading…](https://www.nephros.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Q1-2024-0509_PR-Nephros-Earnings-Release_FINAL.pdf)\n\n[![Collage of charts and graphs with blue replay icon overlaying the image\n](https://www.nephros.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ConferenceCallReplay_square.jpg)](https://www.nephros.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Nephros_20240509_430PME.mp3)Play recording of the Nephros Q1 2024 Conference Call\n\n## Learn More About Nephros\n\nPrevious  Next \n\n[ ![water hitting the ground](https://www.nephros.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iStock-530936826.jpg) Our Story ](https://www.nephros.com/about/)\n\n[ ![Diverse business team at meeting](https://www.nephros.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iStock-1069974378.jpg) Leadership ](https://www.nephros.com/about/leadership/)\n\n[ ![running water faucet](https://www.nephros.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iStock-175426122.jpg) How We Help ](https://www.nephros.com/services/)\n\nClose\n\n## Contact Us\n\nName(Required)\n\nFirst Last\n\nEmail(Required)\n\nCompany(Required)\n\nState(Required)\n\nSelectAlabamaAlaskaArizonaArkansasCaliforniaColoradoConnecticutDelawareDistrict of ColumbiaFloridaGeorgiaHawaiiIdahoIllinoisIndianaIowaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMaineMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMinnesotaMississippiMissouriMontanaNebraskaNevadaNew HampshireNew JerseyNew MexicoNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaOhioOklahomaOregonPennsylvaniaRhode IslandSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaTennesseeTexasUtahVermontVirginiaWashingtonWest VirginiaWisconsinWyomingOther\n\nPhone\n\nMessage\n\nCAPTCHA\n\nSubmit\n\nΔ\n\nNotifications\n"
