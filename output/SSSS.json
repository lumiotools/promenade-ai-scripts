Net assets totaled approximately $157.4 million, or $6.73 per share, at September 30, 2024, as compared to $6.94 per share at June 30, 2024 and $8.41 per share at September 30, 2023.\n\n“Since inception, SuRo Capital has served as the public's gateway to venture capital, offering unique access to some of the world’s most innovative and sought-after private companies before they become publicly traded. Our portfolio spans high-growth sectors including AI infrastructure, emerging consumer brands, and exciting software solutions for both consumer and enterprise markets, among others,” said Mark Klein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SuRo Capital.\n\n“This is an exceptionally promising time for our portfolio,” Mr. Klein continued. “Over the past five years, we have made it a priority to share our perspectives on evolving market cycles and trends. In 2020, we anticipated a significant increase in IPO activity and we strategically positioned our portfolio to capitalize on that potential. In 2021, we monetized over $258 million of our portfolio assets – including two substantial monetizations of Palantir and Coursera, each exceeding $100 million in net proceeds – and declared a total of $8.00 per share for over $212 million in total distributions. As market conditions later became overextended, we scaled back on new capital investments, while judiciously navigating the valuation gap between private and public markets. This year, we continued to execute on a disciplined approach to deploying capital, placing us in a strong position as we look forward.”\n\nMr. Klein then highlighted SuRo Capital’s recent investments, noting, “This year has marked one of our most active investment periods in the last decade. During the quarter, we made a $17.5 million investment in OpenAI (through ARK Type One Deep Ventures Fund LLC), one of the largest artificial intelligence developers in the world, and increased our position in CoreWeave, an AI cloud computing provider, through a $5.0 million secondary transaction. Subsequent to quarter-end, we further bolstered our AI infrastructure portfolio by investing $12.0 million in VAST (through IH10, LLC), a platform transforming productivity and data management in the AI-driven era, alongside an additional $5.0 million in CoreWeave through another secondary transaction.”\n\n“If market conditions remain favorable, we believe the IPO market will re-open, providing substantial opportunities for several investments within our portfolio,” Mr. Klein concluded. “I am confident that our current positioning is as strong, if not stronger, than it was in 2020.”\n\n**Investment Portfolio as of September 30, 2024**\n\nAt September 30, 2024, SuRo Capital held positions in 37 portfolio companies – 33 privately held and 4 publicly held, some of which may be subject to certain lock-up provisions – with an aggregate fair value of approximately $199.3 million. The Company’s top five portfolio company investments accounted for approximately 47% of the total portfolio at fair value as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**Top Five Investments as of September 30, 2024**\n\n**Portfolio Company**(_$ in millions)_| **Cost Basis**| **Fair Value**| **% of Total Portfolio**  \n---|---|---|---  \nCW Opportunity 2 LP & CoreWeave, Inc.(1)| $| 20.2| $| 23.1| 11.6| %  \nLearneo, Inc.| 15.0| 20.8| 10.5  \nARK Type One Deep Ventures Fund LLC(2) | 17.7| 17.7| 8.9  \nBlink Health, Inc.| 15.0| 17.4| 8.7  \nServiceTitan, Inc.| 10.0| 15.3| 7.7  \n**Total****(****3)**| **$**| **77.9**| **$**| **94.2**| **47.3**| **%**  \n  \n__________________(1) Includes SuRo Capital’s $15.0 million investment in CW Opportunity 2 LP and $5.0 million secondary investment in CoreWeave, Inc. common shares.

As of September 30, there were 23,378,002 shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding.\n\nSuRo Capital’s liquid assets were approximately $39.5 million as of September 30, 2024, consisting of cash and securities of publicly traded portfolio companies not subject to lock-up restrictions at quarter-end.\n\n**Convertible Note Purchase Agreement**\n\nOn August 6, 2024, SuRo Capital entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), by and between the Company and the purchaser identified therein (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to which we may issue up to a maximum of $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Convertible Notes due 2029 (the “Convertible Notes”). Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, on August 14, 2024 we issued and sold, and the Purchaser purchased, $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes (the “Initial Notes”). Under the Note Purchase Agreement, upon mutual agreement between the Company and the Purchaser, we may issue additional Convertible Notes for sale in subsequent offerings to the Purchaser (the “Additional Notes”), or issue additional notes with modified pricing terms (the “New Notes”), in the aggregate for both the Additional Notes and the New Notes, up to a maximum of $50.0 million in one or more private offerings.\n\nInterest on the Convertible Notes will be paid quarterly in arrears on March 30, June 30, September 30, and December 30, at a rate of 6.50% per year, beginning September 30, 2024. The Convertible Notes will mature on August 14, 2029, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after August 6, 2027 upon the fulfillment of certain conditions. The Convertible Notes will be convertible into shares of our common stock at the Purchaser's sole discretion at an initial conversion rate of 129.0323 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, subject to adjustments and limitations as provided in the Note Purchase Agreement. The net proceeds from the offering of the Convertible Notes will be used to repay outstanding indebtedness, make investments in accordance with our investment objective and investment strategy, and for other general corporate purposes. The Note Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants by the Company.\n\nSubsequent to quarter-end, pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, on October 9, 2024 we issued and sold, and the Purchaser purchased, $5.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Additional Notes. The Additional Notes are treated as a single series with the Initial Notes and have the same terms as the Initial Notes. The Additional Notes are fungible and rank equally with the Initial Notes. Upon issuance of the Additional Notes, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Notes became $30.0 million.\n\n**Note Repurchase Program**\n\nOn August 6, 2024, SuRo Capital’s Board of Directors approved a discretionary note repurchase program (the “Note Repurchase Program”) which allows the Company to repurchase up to 46.67%, or $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount, of our 6.00% Notes due 2026 (the “6.00% Notes”) through open market purchases, including block purchases, in such manner as will comply with the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\") and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased 1,010,136 of the 6.00% Notes under the Note Repurchase Program.\n\nSubsequent to quarter-end through November 7, 2024, we repurchased an additional 201,446 of the 6.00% Notes under the Note Repurchase Program. The aggregate principal dollar amount of 6.00% Notes that may yet be repurchased by SuRo Capital under the Note Repurchase Program is approximately $4.7 million.\n\n**Share Repurchase Program**\n\nOn October 29, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an extension of, and a $4.3 million increase in the amount of shares that may be repurchased under, the Company's discretionary Share Repurchase Program until the earlier of (i) October 31, 2025 or (ii) the repurchase of $64.3 million in aggregate amount of the Company's common stock. The dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased by the Company under the Share Repurchase Program is approximately $25.0 million.\n\nSince inception of the Share Repurchase Program in August 2017, SuRo Capital has repurchased over 6.0 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $39.3 million. \n\nUnder the Share Repurchase Program, the Company may repurchase its outstanding common stock in the open market, provided it complies with the prohibitions under its insider trading policies and procedures and the applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the Exchange Act.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nManagement will hold a conference call and webcast for investors at 2:00 p.m. PT (5:00 p.m. ET) on November 7, 2024.

This access, once reserved only for venture capitalists, has provided exposure to some of the largest, most compelling, and highly sought after private companies in the world before they become publicly traded. Our current portfolio offers exposure to the infrastructure for artificial intelligence, growing consumer brands, and exciting consumer and enterprise software names, among others,” said Mark Klein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SuRo Capital.\n\nMr. Klein continued, “This year has been one of the most active investment periods for SuRo Capital in the last decade. During the quarter, we made a $17.5 million investment in OpenAI (via ARK Type One Deep Ventures Fund LLC), one of the largest artificial intelligence developers in the world, and increased our position in CoreWeave, an AI cloud computing provider, via a $5.0 million secondary transaction. Subsequent to quarter-end, we made a $12.0 million investment in VAST Data (via IH10, LLC), an AI infrastructure data platform focused on providing enhanced productivity and simple data management for the AI-powered world, and increased our investment in CoreWeave with an additional $5.0 million secondary,” said Mark Klein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SuRo Capital.\n\n“With these new investments and our existing investment in CW Opportunity 2 LP we have invested nearly $55.0 million into some of the leading AI infrastructure companies. Given AI’s significant addressable market, we believe dedicating a significant portion of our portfolio to AI infrastructure will prove to be successful for our shareholders,” Mr. Klein continued.\n\n“Finally, during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a repurchase program of up to $35.0 million for our 6.00% Notes due 2026 and the issuance of up to $75.0 million of private 6.50% Convertible Notes due 2029, with an initial issuance of up to $25.0 million. We believe the refinancing of a portion of our current debt to a longer-dated convertible instrument with favorable terms strengthens our balance sheet, provides greater flexibility to invest capital beyond 2026, and will ultimately maximize shareholder value in the long term,” concluded Mr. Klein.\n\nAs previously reported, SuRo Capital’s net assets totaled approximately $162.3 million, or $6.94 per share, at June 30, 2024, and approximately $212.0 million, or $8.41 per share, at September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, SuRo Capital’s net asset value is estimated to be between $6.50 to $7.00 per share, based on presently available information.\n\n**Investment Portfolio Update** As of September 30, 2024, SuRo Capital held positions in 36 portfolio companies – 32 privately held and 4 publicly held, some of which may be subject to certain lock-up provisions.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, SuRo Capital made the following investments:\n\n**Portfolio Company**| **Investment**| **Transaction Date**| **Amount**(1)  \n---|---|---|---  \nOpenAI Global, LLC – _ARK Type One Deep Ventures Fund LLC_(2)| Convertible Equity viaClass A Interest| 9/25/2024| $17.5 million  \nCoreWeave, Inc.| Common Shares| 9/26/2024| $5.0 million  \n  \n__________________(1) Amount invested does not include any capitalized costs or prepaid management fees or fund expenses, if applicable.(2) SuRo Capital is invested in the Convertible Equity of OpenAI Global, LLC through its investment in the Class A Interest of ARK Type One Deep Ventures Fund LLC.

(f/k/a GSV Sustainability Partners, Inc.) dissolved its business and made a final distribution.(5) Investment made through SuRo Capital Sports, LLC.\n\nSubsequent to quarter-end through October 10, 2024, SuRo Capital made the following investments:\n\n**Portfolio Company**| **Investment**| **Transaction Date**| **Amount**(1)  \n---|---|---|---  \nCoreWeave, Inc.| Series A Preferred| 10/8/2024| $5.0 million  \nVAST Data, Ltd. – _IH10, LLC_(2)| Series B Preferred viaMembership Interest| 10/9/2024| $12.0 million  \n  \n__________________(1) Amount invested does not include any capitalized costs or prepaid management fees or fund expenses, if applicable.(2) SuRo Capital is invested in the Series B Preferred Shares of VAST Data, Ltd. through its investment in the Membership Interest of IH10, LLC. IH10, LLC’s sole portfolio asset is interest in the Series B Preferred Shares of VAST Data, Ltd. through a special purpose vehicle.\n\nSuRo Capital’s liquid assets were approximately $39.5 million as of September 30, 2024, consisting of cash and securities of publicly traded portfolio companies not subject to lock-up restrictions at quarter-end.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were 23,378,002 shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding.\n\n**Convertible Note Purchase Agreement** On August 6, 2024, SuRo Capital entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), by and between the Company and the purchaser identified therein (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to which we may issue up to a maximum of $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Convertible Notes due 2029 (the “Convertible Notes”). Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, on August 14, 2024 we issued and sold, and the Purchaser purchased, $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes (the “Initial Notes”). Under the Note Purchase Agreement, upon mutual agreement between the Company and the Purchaser, we may issue additional Convertible Notes for sale in subsequent offerings to the Purchaser (the “Additional Notes”), or issue additional notes with modified pricing terms (the “New Notes”), in the aggregate for both the Additional Notes and the New Notes, up to a maximum of $50.0 million in one or more private offerings.\n\nInterest on the Convertible Notes will be paid quarterly in arrears on March 30, June 30, September 30, and December 30, at a rate of 6.50% per year, beginning September 30, 2024. The Convertible Notes will mature on August 14, 2029, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after August 6, 2027 upon the fulfillment of certain conditions. The Convertible Notes will be convertible into shares of our common stock at the Purchaser's sole discretion at an initial conversion rate of 129.0323 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, subject to adjustments and limitations as provided in the Note Purchase Agreement. The net proceeds from the offering of the Convertible Notes will be used to repay outstanding indebtedness, make investments in accordance with our investment objective and investment strategy, and for other general corporate purposes. The Note Purchase Agreement includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants by the Company.\n\nSubsequent to quarter-end, pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, on October 9, 2024 we issued and sold, and the Purchaser purchased, $5.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Additional Notes. The Additional Notes are treated as a single series with the Initial Notes and have the same terms as the Initial Notes. The Additional Notes are fungible and rank equally with the Initial Notes. Upon issuance of the Additional Notes, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Notes became $30.0 million.\n\n**Note Repurchase Program** On August 6, 2024, SuRo Capital’s Board of Directors approved a discretionary note repurchase program (the “Note Repurchase Program”) which allows the Company to repurchase up to 46.67%, or $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount, of our 6.00% Notes due 2026 (the “6.00% Notes”) through open market purchases, including block purchases, in such manner as will comply with the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\") and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased 1,010,136 of the 6.00% Notes due 2026 under the Note Repurchase Program.\n\nSubsequent to quarter-end through October 10, 2024, we repurchased an additional 201,446 of the 6.00% Notes due 2026 under the Note Repurchase Program. The aggregate principal dollar amount of 6.00% Notes that may yet be repurchased by SuRo Capital under the Note Repurchase Program is approximately $4.7 million.\n\n**Share Repurchase Program** Under the Share Repurchase Program, the Company may repurchase its outstanding common stock in the open market, provided it complies with the prohibitions under its insider trading policies and procedures and the applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the Exchange Act.\n\nSince inception of the Share Repurchase Program in August 2017, SuRo Capital has repurchased over 6.0 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $39.3 million. This does not include repurchases under various tender offers during this time period. The dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased by SuRo Capital under the Share Repurchase Program is approximately $20.7 million. The Share Repurchase Program is authorized through October 31, 2024.\n\n**Preliminary Estimates and Guidance** The preliminary financial estimates provided herein are unaudited and have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, the management of SuRo Capital.
