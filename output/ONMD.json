This investment is designed to enhance the company’s financial resilience and support the expansion of its cutting-edge iRWD™ platform. As of November 12, 2024, the Company has invested in approximately 34 Bitcoin.\n\nOff The Chain Capital has made significant investments in OneMedNet through multiple funding rounds, and their expertise regarding Bitcoin has been invaluable. Brian Estes, Chief Investment Officer, of Off The Chain Capital, shared, “We believe Bitcoin will become the monetary layer of the world over the next few decades, much like gold was for over 3000 years. Companies that embrace this vision will gain a strategic advantage over those losing the purchasing power of their treasury reserves due to the debasement of fiat currencies.”\n\nOneMedNet has adopted a Bitcoin on the balance sheet strategy based on the approach Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy (MSTR) pioneered, which reflects a forward-looking approach to corporate treasury management that incorporates digital currencies.\n\nThis investment is part of OneMedNet’s commitment to sustainable growth and innovation that supports the healthcare community through high-quality, compliant regulatory grade clinical data. The iRWD™ platform provides secure, comprehensive management of diverse de-identified clinical data, from electronic health records and laboratory results to medical imaging, across our network of 1,400+ healthcare partner sites playing a crucial role in advancing medical research, improving patient care, and driving healthcare innovation.\n\nAaron Green, CEO and President of OneMedNet, stated, “By continuing to invest a portion of our assets into Bitcoin, we aim to not only safeguard our financial stability but also fuel the ongoing development and innovation within our iRWD™ platform.

The members of the Committee are not full-\ntime employees of the Company and may or may not be accountants or auditors by profession or\nexperts in the fields of accounting or auditing and, in any event, do not serve in such capacity.\nConsequently, it is not the duty of the Committee to conduct audits or to determine that the\nCompany’s financial statements and disclosures are complete and accurate and are in accordance\nwith Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and listing standards of the Nasdaq or\nas mandated under applicable laws, rules and regulations (including the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended).

Upon completion of its review of the transaction, the Committee may\ndetermine to permit or to prohibit the Related Party Transaction. An affirmative vote of a majority\nof the members of the Committee present at a meeting at which a quorum is present will be required\nin order to approve a Related Party Transaction. Without a meeting, the unanimous written consent\nof all of the members of the Committee will be required to approve a Related Party Transaction.\nA Related Party Transaction entered into without pre-approval of the Committee shall not\nbe deemed to violate this policy, or be invalid or unenforceable, so long as the transaction is\nbrought to the Committee as promptly as reasonably practical after it is entered into or after it\nbecomes reasonably apparent that the transaction is covered by this policy.\nVI. REPORTING\nThe Committee shall, on an annual basis and in coordination with the Corporate\nGovernance and Nominating Committee, evaluate its own performance.
