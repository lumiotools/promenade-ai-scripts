(NASDAQ: COHU), a global supplier of equipment and services optimizing semiconductor manufacturing yield and productivity, today announced that its Neon platform was selected by a leading U.S. memory and data storage technologies customer for inspection metrology of high bandwidth memory devices (HBM) used in high-performance computing (HPC) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications. \n\nNeon offers a highly efficient vision system enabling full 6-sided optical inspection and measurement of micro-pillars, integration with factory automation and an efficient output sorting process that addresses current and roadmap HBM market needs. Cohu’s vision technology delivers accurate and reliable metrology of thousands of micro-pillars distributed over the HBM device. The accompanying AI inspection software utilizes proprietary deep learning and neural network-based pattern recognition that improves inspection yield. The HBM market is projected to be approximately $23 billion this year with a CAGR of 22% through 2029, representing an opportunity for more than $100M revenue for this class of inspection metrology systems. \n\n“We are pleased to have received an initial order from one of the world’s leading semiconductor memory manufacturers to improve quality of HBM memory used in AI data centers,” commented Luis Müller, Cohu President and CEO. “This is a new market application for Cohu products, and it represents a strategic and substantial growth opportunity aligned with secular growth in artificial intelligence.” \n\n**About Cohu:**\n\nCohu (NASDAQ: COHU) is a global technology leader supplying test, automation, inspection and metrology products and services to the semiconductor industry. Cohu’s differentiated and broad product portfolio enables optimized yield and productivity, accelerating customers’ manufacturing time-to-market.

These non-GAAP financial measures adjust the Company’s actual results prepared under GAAP to exclude charges and the related income tax effect for: share-based compensation, the amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring costs, manufacturing transition and severance costs, acquisition-related costs and associated professional fees, impairments, inventory step-up, depreciation of purchase accounting adjustments to property, plant and equipment, amortization of cloud-based software implementation costs (Adjusted EBITDA only) and loss on extinguishment of debt (Adjusted EBITDA only). Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts for the periods presented herein are provided in schedules accompanying this release and should be considered together with the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. With respect to any forward-looking non-GAAP figures, we are unable to provide without unreasonable efforts, at this time, a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of any forward-looking figures due to their inherent uncertainty. \n\nThese non-GAAP measures are not meant as a substitute for GAAP, but are included solely for informational and comparative purposes. The Company’s management believes that this information can assist investors in evaluating the Company’s operational trends, financial performance, and cash generating capacity. Management uses non-GAAP measures for a variety of reasons, including to make operational decisions, to determine executive compensation in part, to forecast future operational results, and for comparison to our annual operating plan. However, the non-GAAP financial measures should not be regarded as a replacement for (or superior to) corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures. \n\n**Forward Looking Statements:**\n\nCertain statements contained in this release and accompanying materials may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding new product introductions or customer adoptions and corresponding financial impacts; expectations related to our FY2024 outlook, including quarterly projections; effects of near-term growth opportunities and recurring software revenue on future business; and any other statements that are predictive in nature and depend upon or refer to future events or conditions; and/or include words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “likely,” “believe,” “estimate,” “project,” “intend;” and/or other similar expressions among others.

Management views share-based compensation as an expense that is unrelated to the Company’s operational performance as it does not require cash payments and can vary in amount from period to period and the elimination of amortization charges provides better comparability of pre- and post-acquisition operating results and to results of businesses utilizing internally developed intangible assets. Management initiated certain restructuring and manufacturing transition activities including employee headcount reductions and other organizational changes to align our business strategies in light of the acquisitions of MCT and EQT. Restructuring and manufacturing transition costs have been excluded because such expense is not used by Management to assess the core profitability of Cohu’s business operations. Impairment charges have been excluded as these amounts are infrequent and are unrelated to the operational performance of Cohu.
