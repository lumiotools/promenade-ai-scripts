In the electric motorcycle segment, the launch of the NX Hyper marks a significant milestone, showcasing our commitment to performance and innovation.”\n\nDr. Li continued, “We continue to maintain a rapid pace of new store openings this year, laying a solid foundation for driving future sales growth.

Those models will be available in the EU and the US in the coming weeks. Overall, we are well-equipped to embrace changes and are confident in our ability to deliver strong performance in the future.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Revenues** were RMB 1,023.9 million, an increase of 10.5% year-over-year, mainly due to an increase in sales volume of 17.5%, partially offset by a decrease in revenues per e-scooter of 6.0%. The following table shows the revenue breakdown and revenues per e-scooter in the periods presented:\n\n**Revenues****(in RMB million)**| **2024****Q3**| **2023****Q3**| **% changeYoY**  \n---|---|---|---  \nE-scooter sales from China market| 797.5| 710.9| +12.2| %  \nE-scooter sales from international markets| 130.2| 121.7| +7.1| %  \nE-scooter sales, sub-total| 927.7| 832.6| +11.4| %  \nAccessories, spare parts and services| 96.2| 94.4| +1.8| %  \nTotal| 1,023.9| 927.0| +10.5| %  \n  \n**Revenues per e-scooter****(in RMB)**| **2024****Q3**| **2023****Q3**| **% change****YoY**  \n---|---|---|---  \nE-scooter sales from China market2| 3,078| 3,085| -0.2| %  \nE-scooter sales from international markets2| 2,444| 3,430| -28.7| %  \nE-scooter sales| 2,970| 3,131| -5.1| %  \nAccessories, spare parts and services3| 307| 355| -13.5| %  \nRevenues per e-scooter| 3,277| 3,486| -6.0| %  \n  \n  * E-scooter sales revenues from China market were RMB 797.5 million, an increase of 12.2% year-over-year, and represented 86.0% of total e-scooter revenues.

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. NIU believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its operating results. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to NIU’s historical performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude certain items that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant component in the Company’s results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company’s data.\n\nAdjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) excluding share-based compensation expenses. Adjusted net income (loss) margin is defined as adjusted net income (loss) as a percentage of the revenues.\n\nFor more information on non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results”.\n\n**Exchange Rate**\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (“US$”) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the readers.

This update will significantly enhance the bike’s performance, making it a more formidable force on challenging terrains. The OTA update will be available immediately for the XQi3 Wild off-road dirt bike, and available in the coming weeks for the XQi3 Street version in the US and EU.\n\nThe OTA update boosts the XQi3's total power output to an impressive 10.6 kW, improving top speed, acceleration, and overall ride dynamics. Riders will experience quicker 0-30 mph and 0-50 mph times, with top speed increasing from 47 mph to 50 mph. Thanks to an increase in continuous power output by 28% and “Boost Mode” power output by 36%, riders will reach the previous top speed of 47 mph more than two seconds faster than before.\n\nIn addition to higher power output, the XQi3 benefits from improved low- to mid-range torque, delivering a more responsive and exhilarating riding experience. This enhancement ensures the bike excels not only on straightaways but also on rugged, unpredictable terrains. While the update for the off-road version will happen automatically through the NIU app, customers with the street-legal version can choose to update at their own discretion depending on their state’s legality requirements. Customers also have the ability to toggle back and forth between the updated version and standard to enjoy the benefits of the update while they’re off-road and also meet legal requirements when riding on street.\n\n“NIU is setting a new standard in two-wheeled electric mobility as one of the first manufacturers to significantly enhance our existing vehicles through advanced software updates,\" said Benjamin McGill, Director of North America at NIU Technologies. \"We’ve listened to our riders and made an update which marks a significant leap in power and performance. Instead of requiring our users to invest thousands of dollars in aftermarket components, we’re providing these enhancements at no cost.”\n\nTo make the XQi3 even more accessible, NIU has also announced a price drop. Both the XQi3 Wild and Street will now retail at $3,999, reduced from an original price of $4,999, making it a highly competitive option in the dirt bike market.\n\n**Key Highlights of the XQi3 OTA Update:****Max Power Increase:** From 8 kW to 10.6 kW**Continuous Power Output:** Increased by 28%**Boost Mode Power Output:** Increased by 36%**Top Speed Increase:** From 47 mph to 50 mph**Acceleration Improvement:** Reaching 47 mph over 2 seconds faster\n\nNIU continues to push the boundaries of electric mobility with the XQi3, now offering riders an unmatched blend of power, speed and affordability.\n\n**About NIU Technologies:** As a global leader in electric two-wheeled vehicles, NIU's mission is to redefine urban mobility and make life better. Available in 52 countries and listed on Nasdaq, NIU has sold over 4,600,000 electric vehicles since launching its first electric scooter in 2015. Designing and manufacturing high-performance electric motorcycles, mopeds, bicycles, and scooters, as of October 2024, NIU's loyal users and fans have traveled over 25 billion kilometers worldwide.\n\nFor more information about the company, please visit [_https://global.niu.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5mNaiARwoYyvJHz4erEu7eF1FZCdOi4iSUElUQ06Aok7foZrO1L_8E5j3RP-vsgSWAlJGunOclh7H00DO66GK3W9c9qCRFMTBJyuCAW2tfI=).\n\n**Media Contact** Malory Van GuilderSkyya PR for NIUniu@skyya.com\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MmNkN2MzYjctZjM4MC00YjA0LThmMjUtNmI1OTdlNGY2M2IxLTExMzUyNzc=/tiny/Niu-Technologies.png)\n"
