The increase in net earnings during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by the recognition of full year 2023 and year to date 2024 Inflation Reduction Act Advanced Manufacturing credits of $34.9 million, higher LME aluminum price realization of $31.0 million, partially offset by higher power prices of $2.9 million. Third quarter results were also impacted by $12.0 million of net exceptional items, in particular, $3.2 million of stock based compensation costs and $6.9 million of costs incurred following the impact of Hurricane Beryl in Jamaica. Therefore, Century reported an adjusted net income of $60.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, a $59.3 million improvement sequentially.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to Century stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $103.7 million. This was an increase of $69.5 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by favorable realized LME and regional price premiums of $31.7 million, and $34.9 million related to the recognition of 2023 and 2024 additional section 45X tax credits.\n\nCentury's liquidity position at September 30, 2024 was $278.9 million, comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $32.6 million and $246.3 million in combined borrowing availability.\n\n“Strong global demand, continued supply-side challenges and supportive macroeconomic policy in China and the West led to rising aluminum and alumina prices in the third quarter,” noted Century President and CEO Jesse Gary. “With bauxite and alumina supply chains facing a number of challenges around the world, we are thrilled to have our own strategic supply of bauxite and alumina from our Jamalco operations following the acquisition last year. “\n\n“We were very pleased with the final Section 45X rules issued earlier this month that increase the amount of production tax credit we will receive and further bolsters the competitiveness of our U.S. operations. When combined with benefits of our Jamalco acquisition and growing demand for aluminum around the world, we believe Century is well positioned to offer our customers a unique value proposition and superior returns for our shareholders.”\n\n**Fourth****Quarter 2024 Outlook**\n\nThe company expects fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA to range between $70 to $80 million driven by lower LME and regional premium prices offset by lower power costs.\n\n**About Century Aluminum Company**\n\nWith its corporate headquarters located in Chicago, IL, Century Aluminum owns and operates primary aluminum smelting facilities in the United States and Iceland and is the majority owner and managing partner of the Jamalco alumina refinery in Jamaica.

These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of Century’s ongoing operating performance and ability to generate cash. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance an overall understanding of Century’s performance and our investors’ ability to review Century’s business from the same perspective as management. The tables below, under the heading \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\" provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, Century's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA included in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures. We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA because the corresponding forward-looking GAAP financial measures is not currently available and management cannot reliably predict all the necessary components of such forward-looking GAAP measures without unreasonable effort or expense due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such a reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for restructuring, the variability of our tax rate, the impact of foreign currency fluctuation, and other charges reflected in our historical results. The probable significance of each of these items is high and, based on historical experience, could be material.\n\n**Cautionary Statement** This press release and statements made by Century Aluminum Company management on the quarterly conference call contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to the \"safe harbor\" created by section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\").

General\nThe accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Century Aluminum Company should be read in conjunction with the audited\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. In management’s opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect\nall adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, that are necessary for a fair presentation of financial results for the interim periods presented. Operating\nresults for the first nine months of 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. Throughout this\nForm 10-Q, and unless expressly stated otherwise or as the context otherwise requires, \"Century Aluminum\", \"Century\", \"the Company\", \"we\", \"us\", \"our\" and\n\"ours\" refer to Century Aluminum Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOur consolidated financial statements include the consolidated results of the Jamalco joint venture (\"Jamalco\"), an unincorporated joint venture between\nGeneral Alumina Jamaica Limited (\"GAJL\"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Clarendon Alumina Production Limited (\"CAP\"). CAP's\ninterest in the joint venture is reflected as noncontrolling interest on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No. (\"ASU\") 2023-07, \"Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures.\" (\"ASU 2023-07\"). Among other changes, the ASU requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and extends certain\nannual disclosures to interim periods. The ASU is effective for the Company beginning with its annual financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2024,\nearly adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2023-07.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \"Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.\" (\"ASU 2023-09\"). The guidance is intended to improve\nincome tax disclosure requirements by requiring (i) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (ii) the\ndisaggregation of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The ASU is effective for the Company beginning with its annual financial statements for the year ending\nDecember 31, 2025, with early adoption permitted, and is required to be applied prospectively with the option of retrospective application. The Company is\ncurrently evaluating the requirements of ASU 2023-09.\n2. Acquisition of Jamalco\nOn May 2, 2023, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum Jamaica Holdings, Inc. (\"CAJH\"), completed the acquisition of all the outstanding share\ncapital of General Alumina Holdings Limited (\"GAHL\"), the indirect holder of a 55% interest in Jamalco, an unincorporated joint venture engaged in bauxite\nmining and alumina production in Jamaica. The remaining 45% interest in Jamalco is owned by CAP, which is owned by the Government of Jamaica. The results of\noperations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. The purchase price of the acquisition was $1.00, primarily due to\nthe seller experiencing financial distress following curtailment of Jamalco's operations in the second half of 2021 due to a facility fire, with operations restarting in\nthe second half of 2022.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 - Business Combinations,\nresulting in the Company recognizing the assets and liabilities at fair value with the excess over fair value of consideration transferred to the seller presented as a\nbargain purchase gain of $245.9 million recognized within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the\nfirst quarter of 2024, the Company finalized the Jamalco purchase price allocation and recognized measurement period adjustments, which primarily resulted from\nthird-party valuation adjustments to risk premiums, reducing the value of property, plant and equipment by $29.0 million. This reduction in value of property plant\nand equipment resulted in a corresponding reduction to the bargain purchase gain of $29.0 million decreasing the value of the previously recognized bargain\npurchase gain of\n11\nTable of Contents\nCENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY\nCondensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\n$273.4 million as of December 31, 2023 to $245.9 million as of March 31, 2024. The Company finalized its purchase accounting as of March 31, 2024.\nThe following table represents the allocation of the estimated fair value of identified assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest at the\ndate of acquisition:\nPurchase price allocation Amount\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nCash and cash equivalents $ 19.4\nRestricted cash 8.3\nAccounts receivable - net 7.7\nNon-trade receivables 40.4\nInventories 103.9\nPrepaid and other current assets 4.2\nProperty, plant and equipment - net 217.2\nOther assets 26.1\nAccounts payable, trade (94.6)\nAccrued and other current liabilities (29.5)\nOther liabilities (36.5)\nAsset retirement obligation (23.9)\nTotal identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed 242.7\nLess: noncontrolling interest (3.2)\nBargain purchase gain $ 245.9\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the results of operations of the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as if\nthe acquisition of Jamalco had been completed on January 1, 2023. This unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared for informational purposes\nand is not necessarily indicative of the actual consolidated results of operations had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2023, nor is the information\nindicative of future results of operations of the combined companies.\nNine months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023\nRevenue $ 1,722.8\nEarnings (77.0)\n3. Curtailment of Operations - Hawesville\nIn August 2022, we fully curtailed production at the Hawesville facility. We continue to explore all options related to the Hawesville facility.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred curtailment charges of approximately $2.7 million and $5.0 million, respectively. These\ncharges were partially offset by income related to scrap and materials sales of $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no scrap and\nmaterials sales as of the three months ended September 30, 2024. Comparatively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 we incurred curtailment\ncharges of approximately $2.0 million and $13.4 million, including $0.0 million and $9.0 million related to demand capacity charges for power, respectively. These\ncharges were partially offset by income related to scrap and materials sales of $0.0 million and $1.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023.\n4. Related Party Transactions\n12\nTable of Contents\nCENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY\nCondensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThe significant related party transactions occurring during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are described below. All of our\nrelated party transactions are subject to the Company's Related Party Transaction Policy and are required to be made on an arm's length basis and on terms that are\nfair and reasonable to the Company and substantially the same as would apply if the other party was not a related party. We believe all of our transactions with\nrelated parties are at prices that approximate market.\nGlencore Ownership\nAs of September 30, 2024, Glencore plc and its affiliates (together \"Glencore\") beneficially owned 42.9% of Century’s outstanding common stock (45.9% on a\nfully-diluted basis assuming the conversion of all of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock) and all of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. See\nNote 8. Shareholders' Equity for a description of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Century and Glencore enter into various transactions from\ntime to time such as the purchase and sale of primary aluminum, purchase and sale of alumina and other raw materials, tolling agreements as well as forward\nfinancial contracts and borrowing and other debt transactions.\nSales to Glencore\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we derived approximately 61.6% and 73.5% of our consolidated net sales from Glencore,\nrespectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we derived approximately 61.1% and 74.1% of our consolidated net sales from Glencore,\nrespectively.\nGlencore purchases aluminum produced at our U.S. smelters at prices based on the LME plus the Midwest regional delivery premium plus any additional\nmarket-based product premiums. Glencore purchases aluminum produced at our Grundartangi, Iceland smelter at prices primarily based on the LME plus the\nEuropean Duty Paid premium plus any additional market-based product premiums.\nWe have entered into agreements with Glencore pursuant to which we sell certain amounts of alumina at market-based prices.\nPurchases from Glencore\nWe purchase a portion of our alumina and certain other raw material requirements from Glencore. Alumina purchases from Glencore during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, were priced based on published alumina and aluminum indices as well as fixed prices.\nFinancial Contracts with Glencore\nWe have certain financial contracts with Glencore. See Note 15. Derivatives regarding these forward financial sales contracts.\nSummary\nA summary of the aforementioned significant related party sales and purchases is as follows:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet sales to Glencore $ 332.1 400.9 $ 971.3 $ 1,240.3\nPurchases from Glencore(1) 63.9 23.2 179.1 174.5\n(1) Includes settlements of financial contract positions.\nVlissingen Credit Facility\nOn December 9, 2022, Vlissingen entered into a Facility Agreement with Glencore International AG, which was amended and extended on October 1, 2024 (as\namended, the “Vlissingen Credit Facility”). The availability period for borrowings under the Vlissingen Credit Facility was extended by two years and now ends on\nDecember 2, 2026. Under the Vlissingen Credit Facility Vlissingen may borrow from time to time up to $90.0 million in one or more loans at either (i) a fixed\ninterest rate\n13\nTable of Contents\nCENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY\nCondensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nequal to 8.75% per annum (the “Fixed Rate”), or (ii) a variable interest rate equal to the 1-month SOFR rate plus 3.687 percentage points, subject to an absolute\nmaximum level of 9.00% and an absolute minimum level of 7.00% (the “Variable Rate”). The Fixed Rate is only applicable to borrowings made on or before\nDecember 1, 2024, after which the Variable Rate shall apply to all borrowings under the Vlissingen Credit Facility. See Note 11. Debt for additional information.\nBorrowings under the Vlissingen Credit Facility are expected to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes of Century and its subsidiaries.\nCarbon Credit Repurchase Agreement\nIn September 2023, our wholly owned subsidiary Nordural Grundartangi ehf (\"Grundartangi\"), entered into a structured repurchase arrangement (\"Agreement\")\nwith an affiliate of Glencore and sold 390,000 European Union Allowances (\"Carbon Credits\") at a price of €82.18 per Carbon Credit, for an aggregate amount of\n€32.1 million. The terms of the transaction permitted Grundartangi to repurchase the same number of Carbon Credits by December 21, 2023, at a price of €83.72\nper Carbon Credit, for an aggregate amount of €32.7 million. In December 2023, the Agreement was amended (\"Amended Agreement\") to extend the repurchase\nwindow to March 25, 2024, and increased the repurchase price to €85.13 per Carbon Credit, for an aggregate amount of €33.2 million. In addition, Grundartangi\nentered into a second repurchase agreement (\"Second Agreement\") with Glencore to sell 40,000 Carbon Credits at a price of €69.30 per Carbon Credit and to\nrepurchase the same number of Carbon Credits at a price of €70.71 per Carbon Credit by March 25, 2024 for an aggregate amount of €2.8 million.\nIn March 2024, the Amended Agreement was amended to extend the repurchase window from March 25, 2024 to August 30, 2024 and the repurchase price was\nrevised to €87.01 per Carbon Credit, for an aggregate amount of €33.9 million. In addition, the Second Agreement was amended to extend the repurchase window\nfrom March 25, 2024 to August 30, 2024 and revised the repurchase price to €72.59 per Carbon Credit, for an aggregate amount of €2.9 million.\nIn August 2024, the Amended Agreement was amended to extend the repurchase window from August 30, 2024 to December 27, 2024 for 370,700 Carbon\nCredits. The repurchase price was revised to €71.20 per Carbon Credit, for an aggregate amount of €26.4 million. In addition, 59,300 Carbon Credits were settled\non August 30, 2024 for an aggregate amount of €11.1 million.\nDue to the repurchase element of these transactions, the Company retains substantially all of the remaining benefits of the assets and has accounted for the\ntransaction as a financing arrangement in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\").\n5. Revenue\nWe disaggregate our revenue by geographical region as follows:\nNet Sales Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUnited States $ 336.3 $ 337.3 $ 1,011.2 $ 1,042.8\nIceland 202.8 207.9 578.2 630.3\nTotal $ 539.1 $ 545.2 $ 1,589.4 $ 1,673.1\nThe table below shows the amount of net sales to external customers for each of the Company's product categories which accounted for 10% or more of\nconsolidated net sales in either period for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNet Sales Three months ended September 30, Nine months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAluminum $ 489.6 $ 474.1 $ 1,393.9 $ 1,515.1\nAlumina 49.5 71.1 195.5 158.0\nTotal $ 539.1 $ 545.2 $ 1,589.4 $ 1,673.1\n14\nTable of Contents\nCENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY\nCondensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nWe enter into contracts to sell primary aluminum and alumina to our customers. Revenue is recognized when our performance obligations with our customers\nare satisfied. Our obligations under the contracts are satisfied when we transfer control of our primary aluminum or alumina to our customers which is generally\nupon shipment or delivery to customer directed locations. The amount of consideration we receive, thus the revenue we recognize, is a function of volume\ndelivered, market price of primary aluminum which is based on the LME, plus regional premiums and any value-added product premiums or alumina which is\nbased on the alumina pricing index, plus Atlantic differential.\nThe payment terms and conditions in our contracts vary and are not significant to our revenue. We complete an appropriate credit evaluation for each customer\nat contract inception. Customer payments are due in arrears and are recognized as accounts receivable - net and due from affiliates in our consolidated balance\nsheets.\nIn connection with our sales agreements with certain customers, including Glencore, we invoice the customer prior to physical shipment of goods for a majority of\nproduction generated from each of our U.S. domestic smelters. For those sales, revenue is recognized only when the customer has specifically requested such\ntreatment and has made a commitment to purchase the product. The goods must be complete, ready for shipment and separated from other inventory with control\nover the goods passing to the customer. We must retain no further performance obligations.\nContract liabilities are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance. Amounts recognized in Due to affiliates was $41.5 million and\n$30.6 million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n6. Fair Value Measurements\nWe measure certain of our assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nIn general, reporting entities should apply valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs. Observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or\nliability. Unobservable inputs are developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or\nliability.\nThe fair value hierarchy provides transparency regarding the inputs we use to measure fair value. We categorize each fair value measurement in its entirety into\nthe following three levels, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement:\n• Level 1 Inputs - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.\n• Level 2 Inputs - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n• Level 3 Inputs - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements As of September 30, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nASSETS:\nCash equivalents $ 2.7 $ — $ — $ 2.7\nTrust assets(1) 0.7 — — 0.7\nDerivative instruments — 1.7 — 1.7\nTOTAL $ 3.4 $ 1.7 $ — $ 5.1\nLIABILITIES:\nDerivative instruments $ — $ 8.1 $ — $ 8.1\nTOTAL $ — $ 8.1 $ — $ 8.1\n15\nTable of Contents\nCENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY\nCondensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements As of December 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nASSETS:\nCash equivalents $ 16.8 $ — $ — $ 16.8\nTrust assets(1) 0.2 — — 0.2\nDerivative instruments — 2.9 — 2.9\nTOTAL $ 17.0 $ 2.9 $ — $ 19.9\nLIABILITIES:\nDerivative instruments $ — $ 7.9 $ — $ 7.9\nTOTAL $ — $ 7.9 $ — $ 7.9\n(1) Trust assets are currently invested in money market funds.

Earnings Per Share\nBasic and diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") amounts are calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated to\neach class of common stock and participating securities as if all of the net earnings for the period had been distributed. Basic earnings per common share excludes\ndilution and is calculated by dividing net income (loss) allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during\nthe period. Diluted EPS amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive securities. Prior to the three months ended March 31, 2024,\ndiluted EPS amounts were calculated by applying the if-converted method as net income allocated to participating securities was not significant.\n17\nTable of Contents\nCENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY\nCondensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThe following table shows the basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share:\nFor the three months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet Income Shares Net Income Shares\n(Loss) (in millions) $ Per Share (Loss) (in millions) $ Per Share\nNet income (loss) attributable to Century stockholders $ 47.3 $ (42.0)\nLess: net income allocated to participating securities 2.5 —\nBasic EPS:\nNet income (loss) allocated to common stockholders $ 44.8 92.8 $ 0.48 $ (42.0) 92.4 $ (0.45)\nEffect of Dilutive Securities(1):\nShare-based compensation — 1.0 — —\nConvertible senior notes 0.7 4.6 — —\nDiluted EPS:\nNet income (loss) allocated to common stockholders $ 45.5 98.4 $ 0.46 $ (42.0) 92.4 $ (0.45)\nFor the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet Income Shares Net Income Shares\n(Loss) (in millions) Per Share (Loss) (in millions) Per Share\nNet income (loss) attributable to Century stockholders $ 291.6 $ (73.1)\nLess: net income allocated to participating securities 15.5 —\nBasic EPS:\nNet (loss) income allocated to common stockholders $ 276.1 92.7 $ 2.98 $ (73.1) 92.4 $ (0.79)\nEffect of Dilutive Securities(1):\nShare-based compensation 1.2 1.5 — —\nConvertible senior notes 2.7 4.6 — —\nDiluted EPS:\nNet income (loss) allocated to common stockholders\nwith assumed conversion $ 280.0 98.8 $ 2.83 $ (73.1) 92.4 $ (0.79)\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nSecurities excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS (in millions)(1): 2024 2023 2024 2023\nShare-based compensation 0.5 0.8 — 0.9\nConvertible preferred shares 5.2 5.4 5.2 5.4\nConvertible notes 4.6 — 4.6\n(1) In periods when we report a net loss, all share-based compensation awards, convertible preferred shares and convertible senior notes are excluded from the\ncalculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding because of their anti-dilutive effect on earnings (loss) per share.\n18\nTable of Contents\nCENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY\nCondensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\n8. Shareholders’ Equity\nCommon Stock\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 195,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, authorized under our Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation, of which 99,985,365 shares were issued and 92,798,844 shares were outstanding at September 30, 2024, and 99,876,385 were issued\nand 92,689,864 shares were outstanding at December 31, 2023.\nThe rights, preferences and privileges of holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of\nany series of our preferred stock which are currently outstanding, including our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, or which we may designate and issue in the\nfuture.\nPreferred Stock\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, authorized under our Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation. Our Board of Directors may issue preferred stock in one or more series and determine for each series the dividend rights, conversion\nrights, voting rights, redemption rights, liquidating preferences, sinking fund terms and the number of shares constituting that series, as well as the designation\nthereof. Depending upon the terms of preferred stock established by our Board of Directors, any or all of the preferred stock could have preference over the\ncommon stock with respect to dividends and other distributions and upon the liquidation of Century. In addition, issuance of any shares of preferred stock with\nvoting powers may dilute the voting power of the outstanding common stock.\nSeries A Convertible Preferred Stock\nShares Authorized and Outstanding. In 2008, we issued 160,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. At September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, 51,817 and 52,284 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were outstanding, respectively. Glencore holds all of the issued and outstanding Series A\nConvertible Preferred Stock.\nThe issuance of common stock under our stock incentive programs, debt exchange transactions and any stock offering that excludes Glencore participation\ntriggers anti-dilution provisions of the preferred stock agreement and results in the automatic conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shares into shares\nof common stock. The conversion of preferred to common shares is 100 shares of common stock for each share of preferred stock. Our Series A Convertible\nPreferred Stock has a par value of $0.01 per share.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a $60.0 million common stock repurchase program and during the first quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors\nincreased the size of the program by $70.0 million. Under the program, Century is authorized to repurchase up to $130.0 million of our outstanding shares of\ncommon stock, from time to time, on the open market at prevailing market prices, in block trades or otherwise. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased\nwill be determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and other factors. The stock repurchase\nprogram may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nShares of common stock repurchased are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFrom time to time, treasury shares may be reissued as contributions to our employee benefit plans and for the conversion of convertible preferred stock. When\nshares are reissued, we use an average cost method for determining cost. The difference between the cost of the shares and the reissuance price is added to or\ndeducted from additional paid-in capital.\nThrough September 30, 2024 we repurchased 7,186,521 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $86.3 million. We have made no\nrepurchases since April 2015 and have approximately $43.7 million remaining under the repurchase program authorization as of September 30, 2024.\n19\nTable of Contents\nCENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY\nCondensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\n9. Income Taxes\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded an income tax expense of $2.0 million and a tax benefit of $11.0 million, respectively.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded an income tax expense of $3.0 million and a tax benefit of $21.2 million, respectively. The\nchange is primarily due to changes in pretax income amounts and jurisdictional mix on a year over year basis.\nOur income tax expense or benefit for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. The\napplication of the accounting requirements for income taxes in interim periods, after consideration of our valuation allowance on domestic losses, causes a\nsignificant variation in the typical relationship between income tax expense/benefit and pre-tax accounting income/loss as reported on the Consolidated Statement\nof Operations.\nAs of September 30, 2024, all of Century's U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continue to be subject to a full valuation\nallowance.\nSection 45X of The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\"IRA\") contains a production tax credit equal to 10% of certain eligible production costs, including,\nwithout limitation, labor, energy, depreciation and amortization and overhead expenses. On October 24, 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal\nRevenue Service issued final regulations on the production tax credit requirements under Internal Revenue Code Section 45X (the “IRA Regulations”). The IRA\nRegulations provide guidance on rules that taxpayers must satisfy to qualify for the IRA Section 45X tax credit. For the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, the Company recognized a reduction of $47.3 million and $69.9 million in Cost of goods sold and a reduction of $0.8 million and $2.0 million in Selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses, respectively, within the Consolidated Statements of Operations, resulting in an equally offsetting manufacturing credit\nreceivable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a current manufacturing credit receivable of $78.8 million and $59.3\nmillion, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a non-current manufacturing credit receivable of $52.4 million\nand $0.0 million, respectively within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n10.

The interest rate at September 30, 2024 was 3.28%.\n(2) We incur interest at a base rate plus applicable margin as defined within the agreement. The interest rate at September 30, 2024 was 8.50%.\n(3) We incur interest at base rate plus applicable margin as defined within the agreement. The interest rate at September 30, 2024 was 8.33%.\n(4) We incur interest at a base rate plus applicable margin as defined within the agreement. The interest rate at September 30, 2024 was 8.39%.\n(5) We incur interest at a fixed rate equal to 8.75%.\n7.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2028\nIn April 2021, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.5% senior secured notes due April 1, 2028 (the \"2028 Notes\"). We received\nproceeds of $245.2 million, after payment of certain financing fees and related expenses. The 2028 Notes bear interest semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and\nOctober 1 of each year, which began on October 1, 2021, at a rate of 7.5% per annum in cash. The 2028 Notes are senior secured obligations of Century, ranking\nequally in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of Century, but effectively senior to unsecured debt to the extent of the value of\ncollateral. We are in compliance with all applicable covenants under the indenture governing our Senior Notes as of September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the total estimated fair value of the 2028 Notes was $254.3 million. Although we use quoted market prices for identical debt\ninstruments, the markets on which they trade are not considered to be active and are therefore considered Level 2 fair value measurements.\n2.75% Convertible Notes due 2028\nIn April 2021, we completed a private offering of $86.3 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due May 1, 2028 unless earlier\nconverted, repurchased, or redeemed (the \"Convertible Notes\"). The Convertible Notes were issued at a price of 100% of their aggregate principal amount. We\nreceived proceeds of $83.7 million, after payment of certain financing fees and related expenses. The Convertible Notes bear interest semi-annually in arrears on\nMay 1 and November 1 of each year, which began on November 1, 2021, at a rate of 2.75% per annum in cash.\nThe initial conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is 53.3547 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes,\nwhich is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $18.74 per share of\n21\nTable of Contents\nCENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY\nCondensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nthe Company's common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments under certain circumstances in accordance with the\nterms of the indenture. As of September 30, 2024, the conversion rate remains unchanged.\nThe Convertible Notes are the Company’s senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s indebtedness that is\nexpressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company’s unsecured indebtedness that is not so\nsubordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company’s senior secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such\nindebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company’s subsidiaries.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the if-converted value of the Convertible Notes does not exceed the outstanding principal amount.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the total estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes was $96.1 million. Although we use quoted market prices for identical debt\ninstruments, the markets on which they trade are not considered to be active and are therefore considered Level 2 fair value measurements.\nU.S. Revolving Credit Facility\nWe and certain of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries have a senior secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (as amended from time\nto time, the \"U.S. revolving credit facility\"). On June 14, 2022 we amended our U.S. revolving credit facility, increasing our borrowing capacity to $250.0 million\nin the aggregate, including up to $150.0 million under a letter of credit sub-facility. The U.S. revolving credit facility matures on June 14, 2027.\nThe U.S. revolving credit facility contains customary covenants, including restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, indebtedness, affiliate transactions, liens,\ndividends and distributions, dispositions of collateral, investments, and prepayments of indebtedness, as well as a covenant that requires the Borrowers to maintain\ncertain minimum liquidity or availability requirements. We are in compliance with all applicable covenants as of September 30, 2024.\nAny letters of credit issued and outstanding under the U.S. revolving credit facility reduce our borrowing availability on a dollar-for-dollar basis. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, there were $9.6 million of outstanding borrowings and $74.0 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under our U.S. revolving credit\nfacility. Principal payments, if any, are due upon maturity of the U.S. revolving credit facility and may be prepaid without penalty.\nStatus of our U.S. revolving credit facility: September 30, 2024\nCredit facility maximum amount $ 250.0\nBorrowing availability 149.9\nOutstanding letters of credit issued 74.0\nOutstanding borrowings 9.6\nBorrowing availability, net of outstanding letters of credit and borrowings 66.3\nIceland Revolving Credit Facility\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary, Nordural Grundartangi ehf (\"Grundartangi\"), entered into a revolving credit facility agreement with Landsbankinn hf., dated\nNovember 2013, as amended (the \"Iceland revolving credit facility\"), which originally provided for borrowings of up to $50.0 million in the aggregate. On\nFebruary 4, 2022, we amended the Iceland revolving credit facility and increased the facility amount to $80.0 million. On September 28, 2022, we further amended\nthe Iceland revolving credit facility and increased the facility amount to $100.0 million in the aggregate. Under the terms of the Iceland revolving credit facility,\nwhen Grundartangi borrows funds it will designate a repayment date, which may be any date prior to the maturity of the Iceland revolving credit facility. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under our Iceland revolving credit facility. The Iceland revolving credit facility has a term through\nDecember 2026.\nOur Iceland revolving credit facility contains a covenant that requires Grundartangi to maintain a minimum equity ratio. As of September 30, 2024, we were in\ncompliance with all such covenants.\n22\nTable of Contents\nCENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY\nCondensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nStatus of our Iceland revolving credit facility: September 30, 2024\nCredit facility maximum amount $ 100.0\nBorrowing availability 100.0\nOutstanding letters of credit issued —\nOutstanding borrowings —\nBorrowing availability, net of borrowings 100.0\nGrundartangi Casthouse Facility\nOn November 2, 2021, in connection with the casthouse project at Grundartangi, we entered into an eight-year Term Facility Agreement with Arion Bank hf, to\nprovide for borrowings up to $130.0 million (the \"Casthouse Facility\"). Under the Casthouse Facility, repayments of principal amounts will be made in equal\nquarterly installments equal to 1.739% of the principal amount, the first payment occurring in July 2024, with the remaining 60% of the principal amount to be paid\nno later than the termination date in December 2029. As of September 30, 2024, there were $125.5 million in outstanding borrowings under the Casthouse Facility.\nThe Casthouse Facility also contains customary covenants, including restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, indebtedness, preservation of assets, and\ndispositions of assets and contains a covenant that requires Grundartangi to maintain a minimum equity ratio. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance\nwith all such covenants.\nIceland Term Facility\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary, Grundartangi, entered into a Term Facility Agreement with Arion Bank hf, dated September 2022, (the \"Iceland Term Facility\")\nto provide for borrowings up to €13.6 million. Repayments of principal amounts were made in equal monthly installments, the first payment occurring in February\n2023, with the remainder of the principal amount paid in January 2024. Borrowings under the Iceland Term Facility bore interest at a rate equal to 3.2% plus EUR\nEURIBOR 1 month as published at any time by the European Money Markets Institute. The Iceland Term Facility has been repaid in full and has terminated\npursuant to its terms in the first quarter of 2024.\nVlissingen Credit Facility\nOn December 9, 2022, Vlissingen entered into a $90.0 million Facility Agreement with Glencore International AG, which was amended and extended on\nOctober 1, 2024. The availability period for borrowings under the Vlissingen Credit Facility was extended by two years and now ends on December 2, 2026.\nPursuant to the terms of the Vlissingen Credit Facility, Vlissingen may borrow from time to time up to $90.0 million in one or more loans at either (i) a fixed\ninterest rate equal to 8.75% per annum (the “Fixed Rate”), or (ii) a variable interest rate equal to the 1-month SOFR rate plus 3.687 percentage points, subject to an\nabsolute maximum level of 9.00% and an absolute minimum level of 7.00%. The Fixed Rate is only applicable to borrowings made on or before December 1, 2024,\nafter which the Variable Rate shall apply to all borrowings under the Vlissingen Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, there were $10.0 million in outstanding\nborrowings under the Vlissingen Credit Facility.\nThe Vlissingen Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including with respect to mergers, guarantees and preservation and dispositions of assets. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants\nHancock County Industrial Revenue Bonds\nAs part of the purchase price for our acquisition of the Hawesville facility, we assumed IRBs which were issued in connection with the financing of certain solid\nwaste disposal facilities constructed at the Hawesville facility. The IRBs bear interest at a variable rate not to exceed 12% per annum determined weekly based upon\nprevailing rates for similar bonds in the industrial revenue bond market and interest on the IRBs is paid quarterly. The IRBs are secured by a letter of credit issued\nunder our U.S revolving credit facility and mature in April 2028.\nSurety Bond Facility\nAs part of our normal business operations, we are required to provide surety bonds or issue letters of credit in certain states in which we do business as\ncollateral for certain workers' compensation obligations. In June 2022, we entered into a surety bond facility with an insurance company to provide such bonds\nwhen applicable. As of September 30, 2024, we had issued surety\n23\nTable of Contents\nCENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY\nCondensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nbonds totaling $6.6 million. As we had previously guaranteed our workers' compensation obligations through issuance of letters of credit against our revolving\ncredit facility, the surety bond issuance increases credit facility availability.\n12. Commitments and Contingencies\nWe have pending against us or may be subject to various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related primarily to employment, commercial, stockholder,\nenvironmental, safety and health matters and are involved in other matters that may give rise to contingent liabilities. While the results of such matters and claims\ncannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the ultimate outcome of any such matters and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our financial\ncondition, results of operations or liquidity. However, because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation and estimating liabilities, should the resolution or\noutcome of these actions be unfavorable, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn evaluating whether to accrue for losses associated with legal or environmental contingencies, it is our policy to take into consideration factors such as the\nfacts and circumstances asserted, our historical experience with contingencies of a similar nature, the likelihood of our prevailing and the severity of any potential\nloss. For some matters, no accrual is established because we have assessed our risk of loss to be remote. Where the risk of loss is probable and the amount of the\nloss can be reasonably estimated, we record an accrual, either on an individual basis or with respect to a group of matters involving similar claims, based on the\nfactors set forth above. While we regularly review the status of, and our estimates of potential liability associated with, contingencies to determine the adequacy of\nany associated accruals and related disclosures, the ultimate amount of loss may differ from our estimates.\nLegal Contingencies\nRavenswood Retiree Medical Benefits\nIn November 2009, Century Aluminum of West Virginia (\"CAWV\") filed a class action complaint for declaratory judgment against the United Steel, Paper and\nForestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (\"USW\"), the USW’s local and certain CAWV retirees,\nindividually and as class representatives (\"CAWV Retirees\"), seeking a declaration of CAWV’s rights to modify/terminate retiree medical benefits. Later in\nNovember 2009, the USW and representatives of a retiree class filed a separate suit against CAWV, Century Aluminum Company, Century Aluminum Master\nWelfare Benefit Plan, and various John Does with respect to the foregoing. On August 18, 2017, the District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia\napproved a settlement agreement in respect of these actions, pursuant to which agreement, CAWV agreed to make payments into a trust for the benefit of the\nCAWV Retirees in the aggregate amount of $23.0 million over the course of ten years. Upon approval of the settlement, we paid $5.0 million to the aforementioned\ntrust in September 2017 and recognized a gain of $5.5 million to arrive at the then-net present value of $12.5 million. CAWV has agreed to pay the remaining\namounts under the settlement agreement in annual increments of $2.0 million for nine years. As of September 30, 2024, $2.0 million was recorded in Other current\nliabilities and $1.5 million was recorded in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPBGC Settlement\nIn 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the \"PBGC\") regarding an alleged \"cessation of operations\" at\nour Ravenswood facility (the \"PBGC Settlement Agreement\"). Pursuant to the terms of the PBGC Settlement Agreement, we agreed to make additional\ncontributions (above any minimum required contributions) to our defined benefit pension plans totaling approximately $17.4 million. Under certain circumstances,\nin periods of lower primary aluminum prices relative to our cost of operations, we were able to defer one or more of these payments, provided that we provide the\nPBGC with acceptable security for such deferred payments. We historically elected to defer certain payments under the PBGC Settlement Agreement and provided\nthe PBGC with the appropriate security. In October 2021, we amended the PBGC Settlement Agreement (the \"Amended PBGC Settlement Agreement\") such that\nwe removed the deferral mechanism and agreed to contribute approximately $2.4 million per year to our defined benefit pension plans for a total of approximately\n$9.6 million, over the next four years beginning on November 30, 2022 and ending on November 30, 2025, subject to acceleration if certain terms and conditions\nare met in such amendment. As of September 30, 2024, we made contributions of $7.2 million including $0.3 million during the three months ended September 30,\n2024. Comparatively, as of September 30, 2023, we made contributions of $6.9 million including $4.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n24\nTable of Contents\nCENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY\nCondensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nPower Commitments and Contingencies\nHawesville\nHawesville has a power supply arrangement with Kenergy and Century Marketer, LLC (“Century Marketer\"), Century's wholly-owned subsidiary that acts as a\nMISO market participant. Under this arrangement, Hawesville gets access to power at Midcontinent Independent System Operator (\"MISO\") pricing plus\ntransmission and other costs. As the MISO Market Participant, Century Marketer purchases power from MISO for resale to Kenergy, which then resells the power\nto Hawesville. Century Marketer's power supply arrangement with Kenergy has an effective term through May 31, 2028, with automatic one-year extensions unless\neither party provides one-year notice of termination prior to the May 31 anniversary date. Similarly, Kenergy's power supply contract with Hawesville has a term\nthrough December 31, 2025, with automatic one-year extensions unless either party provides one-year notice of termination prior to the December 31 anniversary\ndate.\nSebree\nSebree has a power supply arrangement with Kenergy and Century Marketer. Under this arrangement, Sebree gets access to power at Midcontinent\nIndependent System Operator (\"MISO\") pricing plus transmission and other costs. As the MISO Market Participant, Century Marketer purchases power from MISO\nfor resale to Kenergy, which then resells the power to Sebree. Century Marketer's power supply arrangement with Kenergy has an effective term through May 31,\n2028, with automatic one-year extensions unless either party provides one-year notice of termination prior to the May 31 anniversary date. Similarly, Kenergy's\npower supply contract with Sebree has a term through December 31, 2025, with automatic one-year extensions unless either party provides one-year notice of\ntermination prior to the December 31 anniversary date.\nMt. Holly\nCentury Aluminum of South Carolina (\"CASC\") has a power supply agreement with Santee Cooper that has an effective term through December 2026. Under\nthis power supply agreement, 100% of Mt. Holly’s electrical power requirements are supplied from Santee Cooper’s generation at cost of service based rates.\nGrundartangi\nGrundartangi has power purchase agreements for approximately 545 MW of aggregate power with HS Orka hf (\"HS\"), Landsvirkjun and Orkuveita\nReykjavikur (\"OR\"). These power purchase agreements expire on various dates from 2026 through 2036 (subject to extension). The power purchase agreements\nwith each of HS and OR provide power at LME-based variable rates for the duration of these agreements. Under the terms of the Landsvirkjun agreement,\nLandsvirkjun will provide up to 182 MW over time to support the most recent capacity creep requirements and the new billet casthouse at Grundartangi. The\nLandsvirkjun agreement provides for fixed rates on most of the 182 MW, with a variable rate applicable to a smaller portion of the power through December 31,\n2026. Grundartangi also has a separate 25 MW power purchase agreement with Landsvirkjun at LME-based variable rate.\nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nLabor Commitments\nThe bargaining unit employees at our Grundartangi, Vlissingen, Hawesville, Sebree and Jamalco facilities are represented by labor unions, representing\napproximately 58% of our total workforce.\nApproximately 87% of Grundartangi’s work force is represented by five labor unions, governed by a labor agreement that establishes wages and work rules for\ncovered employees. This agreement is effective through December 31, 2024.\n100% of Vlissingen's work force is represented by the Federation for the Metal and Electrical Industry (\"FME\"), a Netherlands' employers' organization for\ncompanies in the metal, electronics, electrical engineering and plastic sectors. The FME negotiates working conditions with trade unions on behalf of its members,\nwhich, when agreed upon, are then applicable to all employees of Vlissingen. The current labor agreement is effective through December 31, 2025.\nApproximately 39% of our U.S. based work force is represented by USW through separately negotiated labor agreements for each facility. The labor agreement\nfor Hawesville employees is effective through April 1, 2026. Upon announcement of the temporary curtailment, Hawesville and the USW local union entered into\neffects bargaining. An agreement was reached on July\n25\nTable of Contents\nCENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY\nCondensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n(amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\n19, 2022, covering the curtailment period. Century Sebree's labor agreement with the USW for its employees is effective through October 28, 2028. Mt. Holly\nemployees are not represented by a labor union.\nApproximately 61% of Jamalco’s work force is represented by the Union of Technical, Administrative, and Supervisory Personnel (\"UTASP\") through\nseparately negotiated labor agreements for hourly and salaried employee groups. Both contracts were effective through December 31, 2023. Jamalco is currently in\nthe process of negotiating new contracts with both the salaried and hourly employee groups.\nContingent obligations\nWe have a contingent obligation in connection with the \"unwind\" of a contractual arrangement between CAKY, Big Rivers Electric Corporation (\"Big Rivers\")\nand a third party and the execution of a long-term cost-based power contract with Kenergy, a member of a cooperative of Big Rivers, in July 2009. This contingent\nobligation consists of the aggregate payments made to Big Rivers by the third party on CAKY’s behalf in excess of the agreed upon base amount under the long-\nterm cost-based power contract with Kenergy. As of September 30, 2024, the principal and accrued interest for the contingent obligation was $32.0 million, which\nwas fully offset by a derivative asset. We may be required to make installment payments for the contingent obligation in the future. These payments are contingent\nbased on the LME price of primary aluminum and the level of Hawesville’s operations. As of September 30, 2024, the LME forward market prices do not exceed\nthe threshold for payment. In addition, based on the current level of Hawesville's operations, including the temporary curtailment, we believe that we will not be\nrequired to make payments on the contingent obligation during the term of the agreement, which expires in 2028. There can be no assurance that circumstances will\nnot change thus accelerating the timing of such payments.\n13.

Derivatives\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had an open position of 39,427 tonnes related to LME forward financial sales contracts to fix the forward LME aluminum price.\nThese contracts are expected to settle monthly through September 2026. We also had an open position of 30,700 tonnes related to MWP forward financial sales\ncontracts to fix the forward MWP price. These contracts are expected to settle monthly through September 2026. We also enter into financial contracts with various\ncounterparties to offset fixed price sales arrangements with certain of our customers (\"fixed for floating swaps\") to remain exposed to the LME and MWP\naluminum prices. As of September 30, 2024, we had no open fixed for floating swaps.\nWe have entered into forward contracts to hedge the risk of fluctuations associated with the Icelandic Krona (ISK) and Euro for contracts related to the\nconstruction of the Grundartangi casthouse denominated in these currencies (\"casthouse currency hedges\"). As of September 30, 2024, we had no open casthouse\ncurrency hedges.\nWe have entered into financial contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure at our operations to the NYMEX Henry Hub (“NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas\nprice swaps”). The natural gas volume is measured per million British Thermal Units (\"MMBtu\"). As of September 30, 2024 we had no open NYMEX Henry Hub\nnatural gas price swaps.\nWe have entered into financial contracts to hedge a portion of our Jamalco fuel cost exposure (“HFO price swaps”). The volume of heavy fuel oil (\"HFO\")\nconsumed at Jamalco is measured per barrel and as of September 30, 2024, we had an open position of 335,000 barrels. The HFO price swaps are expected to settle\nmonthly through December 2025.\nWe have entered into financial contracts to fix a portion of our exposure to the Indiana Hub power market at our Sebree plant (\"Indiana Hub power price\nswaps\"). As of September 30, 2024, we had an open position of 565,512 MWh. The Indiana Hub power price swaps are expected to settle monthly through\nSeptember 2026.\nOur agreements with derivative counterparties contain certain provisions requiring collateral to be posted in the event the market value of our position exceeds\nthe margin threshold limit of our master agreement with the counterparty.

Comparatively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 $3.7 million of the net gain was with Glencore, and\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023 $6.6 million of the net loss was with Glencore.\n16. Subsequent Events\nWe evaluate subsequent events that have occurred after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. There are two types of subsequent\nevents: (1) recognized, or those that provide additional evidence with respect to conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet, including the estimates\ninherent in the process of preparing financial statements, and (2) non-recognized, or those that provide evidence with respect to conditions that did not exist at the\ndate of the balance sheet but arose subsequent to that date.\nOn October 24, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations regarding implementing Section 45X of the\nInflation Reduction Act, which provide guidance on rules taxpayers must satisfy to qualify for the tax credit. The government has incentivized the production of\naluminum by offering a tax credit equal to 10% of eligible domestic production costs. The Final Regulations have been amended to allow, “direct material costs as\ndefined in § 1.263A-1(e)(2)(i)(A), indirect material costs as defined in § 1.263A-1(e)(3)(ii)(E), or any costs related to the extraction or acquisition of raw materials\nto be taken into account as production costs.”\nWe have concluded it is appropriate to apply IAS 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, to account for the\nrefundable tax credit as an income grant. Therefore, the issuance of Final Regulations provides us with reasonable assurance regarding the eligibility of direct\nmaterial costs and indirect material costs and provided additional evidence regarding the Company’s estimated manufacturing credit receivable as it relates to\ncarbon and\n29\nsupplies utilized in production. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $34.9 million as a reduction in Cost of goods sold, and $21.7 million and\n$13.2 million as an increase in our manufacturing credit receivable and our Non-current manufacturing credit receivable within Other assets on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet.\nHowever, with regards to the definition of aluminum, the Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that additional consideration is necessary\nprior to finalizing proposed § 1.45X-4(b)(1), which the Treasury Department and the IRS intend to do at a later date. For that reason, § 1.45X-4(b)(1) is reserved in\nthese final regulations. With regards to estimates related to the definition of aluminum, namely the inclusivity of the costs of alumina, the Company will continue to\nassess the estimated credit calculation as final regulations on that matter are issued.\n30\nTable of Contents\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis quarterly report includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are subject to\nthe \"safe harbor\" created by section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"),\nas amended.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the\nconsolidated financial condition and results of operations of Century Aluminum Company and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes thereto. This MD&A contains “forward-looking statements” - see “Forward-Looking Statements” above.\nOverview\nWe are a global producer of primary aluminum with aluminum reduction facilities, or \"smelters,\" in the United States and Iceland. In addition to our primary\naluminum assets, we have a 55% joint venture interest in the Jamalco bauxite mining operation and alumina refinery in Jamaica. The Jamalco refinery supplies a\nsubstantial amount of the alumina used for the production of primary aluminum at our Grundartangi, Iceland facility. We also own a carbon anode production\nfacility located in the Netherlands. The key determinants of our results of operations and cash flows from operations are as follows:\n• the price of primary aluminum, which is based on the London Metal Exchange (\"LME\") and other exchanges, plus any regional premiums and value-\nadded product premiums;\n• the cost of goods sold, the principal components of which are electrical power, alumina, carbon products, labor and other controllable costs, which in\naggregate represent more than 78% of our cost of goods sold; and\n• our production volume and product mix.\nRecent Developments\nSection 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act\nOn October 24, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations implementing Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction\nAct, which provide guidance on rules taxpayers must satisfy to qualify for the tax credit. The government has incentivized the production of aluminum by offering a\ntax credit equal to 10% of eligible domestic production costs. Based on the final regulations, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we\nrecognized $47.3 million and $69.9 million as a reduction in Cost of goods sold and $0.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively, as a reduction in Selling, general\nand administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations, resulting in an equally offsetting receivable. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, we recognized a manufacturing credit receivable of $78.8 million and $59.3 million, respectively, and as of September 30, 2024, we\nrecognized a non-current manufacturing credit receivable of $52.4 million within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nU.S. Department of Energy Award\nOn March 25, 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\") Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations selected the Company to begin award negotiations for\nup to $500.0 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act funding to build a new aluminum smelter as part of the Industrial Demonstrations\nProgram (\"IDP\"). With the help of this funding, we plan to build the first new U.S. primary aluminum smelter in 45 years at a site within the Ohio/Mississippi River\nBasins.\nAcquisition of 55% interest in Jamalco\nOn May 2, 2023, our wholly-owned subsidiary, CAJH, acquired for $1.00 all of the outstanding share capital of GAHL, the indirect holder of a 55% interest in\nJamalco, an unincorporated joint venture with CAP, which is owned by the Government of Jamaica. Jamalco is engaged in bauxite mining and alumina refining in\nJamaica. The Company's indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, GAJL, is the manager of Jamalco. Jamalco has alumina production capacity of approximately 1.4\nmillion tonnes. We finalized the purchase accounting and recognized a bargain purchase gain of $245.9 million within the Consolidated Statements of Operations\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our historical financial statements for periods prior to May 2, 2023 do not include the results of Jamalco. Refer to\nNote 2. Acquisition of Jamalco for further information.\nEquipment Failure\nStarting in June 2023, we experienced power disruptions due to damage to the Jamalco power generation unit. The equipment returned to full capacity as of the\nend of October 2023. We are actively engaged with our insurance carriers in connection with this equipment failure to determine the specific amount of coverage\navailable to us under our business interruption insurance, including any applicable deductibles. The cumulative impact of the equipment failure was approximately\n$38.8 million.\n33\nTable of Contents\nHurricane Beryl\nIn early July 2024, Hurricane Beryl temporarily impacted our operations in Jamaica. Jamalco’s production facilities escaped significant damage, but the port\nfacility was impacted by the storm, where a portion of the alumina conveyor was damaged. Jamalco's bauxite mining and alumina production joint venture returned\nto full production on July 12, 2024. Jamalco secured alternative port arrangements to allow for alumina shipments to its customers while the repairs to the conveyor\nwere ongoing. On September 17, 2024, we resumed normal shipping operations at Jamalco’s Rocky Point port following the completion of repairs to the port.\nHawesville curtailment\nIn August 2022 we fully curtailed production at the Hawesville facility. We continue to explore all options related to the Hawesville facility.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred curtailment charges of approximately $2.7 million and $5.0 million, respectively. These\ncharges were partially offset by income related to scrap and materials sales of $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no scrap and\nmaterials sales as of the three months ended September 30, 2024. Comparatively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 we incurred curtailment\ncharges of approximately $2.0 million and $13.4 million, including $0.0 million and $9.0 million related to demand capacity charges for power, respectively. These\ncharges were partially offset by income related to scrap and materials sales of $0.0 million and $1.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023\nPricing of aluminum\nThe overall price of primary aluminum consists of three components: (i) the base commodity price, which is based on quoted prices on the LME and other\nexchanges; plus (ii) any regional premium (e.g., the Midwest premium for metal sold in the United States (\"MWP\") and the European Duty Paid premium for metal\nsold into Europe (\"EDPP\")); plus (iii) any value-added product premium. Each of these price components has its own drivers and variability.\nThe price of aluminum is influenced by a number of factors, including global supply-demand balance, inventory levels, speculative activities by market\nparticipants, production activities by producers, geopolitical and economic conditions, as well as production costs in major production regions. These factors can be\nhighly variable and difficult to predict, which can lead to significant volatility in the price of aluminum. Increases or decreases in primary aluminum prices drive\nvariability in our revenues (assuming all other factors are unchanged). From time to time, we may seek to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the LME price of\nprimary aluminum and/or associated regional premiums through financial instruments designed to limit our downside price risk. Information regarding financial\ncontracts is included in Note 15. Derivatives and risks associated with such financial contracts are disclosed specifically in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe saw a decline in the pricing of aluminum through the third quarter of 2024. The following table summarizes the average price for primary aluminum per\ntonne for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 compared to the average price for primary aluminum per tonne for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 .\nThree months ended Nine months ended\n($ per tonne) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAverage LME $ 2,383 $ 2,520 $ 2,367 $ 2,272\nAverage MWP $ 411 431 415 544\nAverage EDPP $ 341 323 303 301\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects no change in production capacities.\nOur net sales are impacted primarily by the LME price for aluminum, regional and value-added premiums, and the volume and product mix of aluminum we\nship during the period. In general, our results reflect the LME and regional premium pricing on an approximately one to three month lag basis reflecting contractual\nterms with our customers.\n34\nTable of Contents\nElectrical power, alumina, carbon products, labor, and other controllable costs are the principal components of our cost of goods sold. Power costs can be\nvolatile as a result of a number of factors beyond our control. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Increases in energy costs may adversely affect our business, financial\nposition, results of operations and liquidity” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Power costs at our Kentucky plants are\nimpacted by capacity demand charges, which are determined based on available power generating capacity in MISO, from which we purchase energy. The price of\nsuch capacity is set by auction annually in the spring. Our expected capacity demand costs for power were approximately $2 million for the twelve months ending\nMay 31, 2024, in addition to the market price of power used. We anticipate the capacity demand power costs resulting from the spring 2024 auction for the twelve\nmonths ending May 31, 2025 to be approximately $3 million.\nIn 2024, energy prices in the U.S. and Europe have moderated from their previously elevated levels. European energy markets impact our Vlissingen facility in\nthe Netherlands, which utilizes natural gas to produce anodes used in our Grundartangi operations. The energy market in Europe has historically been dependent\nupon imported natural gas from Russia, and the significant reduction in Russian gas supply to Europe has resulted in increased uncertainty with respect to the price\nand availability of natural gas. Adverse changes to European natural gas prices or availability could adversely affect operations at Vlissingen, and in turn operations\nat Grundartangi, if we are not able to source an alternative supply of anodes.\nIn general, our results reflect the market cost of alumina on an approximately three-month lag reflecting the terms of our alumina contracts and inventory\nlevels.\nQuarter ended Nine months ended\nSequential Year-to-date\nSeptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNET SALES:\nRelated parties $ 332.1 $ 324.2 $ 971.3 $ 1,240.3\nOther customers 207.0 236.6 618.1 432.8\nTotal net sales 539.1 560.8 1,589.4 1,673.1\nGross profit (loss) 81.8 20.4 118.7 52.5\nNet income (loss) 42.3 (6.7) 280.3 (77.9)\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (5.0) (4.2) (11.3) (4.8)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Century stockholders 47.3 (2.5) 291.6 (73.1)\nNET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO CENTURY STOCKHOLDERS PER COMMON SHARE:\nBasic $ 0.48 $ (0.03) $ 2.98 $ (0.79)\nDiluted 0.46 (0.03) 2.83 (0.79)\nSHIPMENTS -

See Note 9. Income Taxes to the\nconsolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nOur principal sources of liquidity are available cash and cash flows from operations. We also have access to our existing U.S. and Iceland revolving credit\nfacilities (collectively, the \"revolving credit facilities\") and have raised capital in the past through public equity and debt markets. Our principal uses of cash include\nthe funding of operating costs (including post-retirement benefits), debt service requirements, capital expenditures, investments in our growth activities and in\nrelated businesses, working capital and other general corporate requirements.\nWe believe that cash provided from operations and financing activities will be adequate to cover our operations and business needs over the next twelve\nmonths. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $32.6 million and unused availability under our revolving credit facilities of\n$246.3 million (including $80 million under the Vlissingen Credit Facility referred to below, which expires in December 2026). Our cash and cash equivalents and\nunused availability under our revolving credit facilities comprise our liquidity position, which was $278.9 million as of September 30, 2024.\nAvailable Cash\nOur available cash and cash equivalents balance at September 30, 2024 was $32.6 million compared to $88.8 million at December 31, 2023.\n37\nTable of Contents\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur statements of cash flows are summarized below:\nNine months Ended September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 16.8 $ 39.6\nNet cash used in investing activities (66.8) (17.6)\nNet cash (used) provided by financing activities (4.9) 17.2\nChange in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (54.9) $ 39.2\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 was primarily driven by timing of payments and receipts.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nwas primarily due to higher cash spend on the purchase of property, plant and equipment in the current year attributable to the Grundartangi casthouse project and\nJamalco port repair. Additionally, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received cash inflows of $19.4 million from the acquisition of\nsubsidiary, net of cash acquired.\nThe change in net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 was primarily due to reduction in net borrowings on our revolving credit facilities and Grundartangi Casthouse Facility as well as the repayment of carbon\ncredits.\nAvailability Under Our Credit Facilities\nOur U.S. revolving credit facility, dated May 2018 (as amended, the \"U.S. revolving credit facility\"), previously provided for borrowings of up to $220.0\nmillion, including up to $110.0 million under a letter of credit sub-facility. In June 2022, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to our existing $220.0 million U.S.\nrevolving credit facility, increasing the maximum capacity from $220.0 million to $250.0 million, including up to $150.0 million under a letter of credit sub-facility.\nThe U.S. revolving credit facility matures in June 2027. Any letters of credit issued and outstanding under the U.S. revolving credit facility reduce our borrowing\navailability on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\nWe have also entered into, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Nordural Grundartangi ehf (\"Grundartangi\"), a $50.0 million revolving credit facility, dated\nNovember 2013, as amended (the \"Iceland revolving credit facility\"). On February 4, 2022, we amended the Iceland revolving credit facility and increased the\nfacility amount to $80.0 million in the aggregate. On September 28, 2022, we further amended the Iceland revolving credit facility and increased the facility amount\nto $100.0 million in the aggregate. The Iceland revolving credit facility matures in December 2026.\nThe availability of funds under our credit facilities is limited by a specified borrowing base consisting of certain accounts receivable, inventory and qualified\ncash deposits which meet the lenders' eligibility criteria. Increases in the price of aluminum and/or restarts of previously curtailed operations, for example, increase\nour borrowing base by increasing our accounts receivable and inventory balances; decreases in the price of aluminum and/or curtailments of production capacity\nwould decrease our borrowing base by reducing our accounts receivable and inventory balances. As of September 30, 2024, our U.S. revolving credit facility had a\nborrowing availability of $149.9 million, outstanding borrowings of $9.6 million, and $74.0 million of outstanding letters of credit with total availability of $66.3\nmillion. Of the outstanding letters of credit, $13.7 million are related to our power commitments, $33.2 million are related to raw materials and the remaining\n$27.1 million are primarily for the purpose of securing certain debt and workers’ compensation commitments. As of September 30, 2024, our Iceland revolving\ncredit facility had a borrowing base of $100.0 million and no outstanding borrowings, with total availability of $100.0 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our credit facilities had $246.3 million of net availability after consideration of our outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. We\nmay borrow and make repayments under our credit facilities in the ordinary course based on a number of factors, including the timing of payments from our\ncustomers and payments to our suppliers.\nOur credit facilities contain customary covenants, including restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, indebtedness, affiliate transactions, liens, dividends and\ndistributions, dispositions of collateral, investments and prepayments of indebtedness, including in the U.S. revolving credit facility, a springing financial covenant\nthat requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.0 to 1.0 as of any date of determination on which availability under the U.S. revolving credit\nfacility is less than or equal to $25.0 million, or 10% of the borrowing base, but not less than $17.85 million. We intend to maintain\n38\nTable of Contents\navailability to comply with these levels any time we would not meet the ratio, which could limit our ability to access the full amount of our availability under our\nU.S revolving credit facility. Our Iceland revolving credit facility contains a covenant that requires Grundartangi to maintain a minimum equity ratio. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants or maintained availability above such covenant triggers.\nGrundartangi Casthouse Facility\nOn November 2, 2021, Grundartangi entered into an eight-year Term Facility Agreement with Arion Bank hf, to provide for borrowings up to $130 million in\nconnection with the casthouse project at Grundartangi (the \"Casthouse Facility\"). Under the Casthouse Facility, repayments of principal amounts will be made in\nequal quarterly installments equal to 1.739% of the principal amount, the first payment occurring in July 2024, with the remaining 60% of the principal amount to\nbe paid no later than the termination date. The Casthouse Facility will mature in December 2029. The Casthouse Facility bears interest at a rate plus applicable\nmargin as defined within the agreement. As of September 30, 2024 there were $125.5 million in outstanding borrowings under the Casthouse Facility.\nThe Casthouse Facility also contains customary covenants, including restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, indebtedness, preservation of assets, and\ndispositions of assets and contains a covenant that requires Grundartangi to maintain a minimum equity ratio. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance\nwith all such covenants.\nSenior Notes and Convertible Senior Notes\nIn April 2021, we issued $250.0 million principal of senior secured notes that will mature on April 1, 2028 (the \"2028 Notes\"), unless earlier refinanced in\naccordance with their terms. Interest on the 2028 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, at a rate of 7.5% per year. The indenture\ngoverning the 2028 Notes contains customary covenants which may limit our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to: (i) incur additional debt;\n(ii) incur additional liens; (iii) pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock; (iv) purchase or redeem capital stock; (v) make investments or certain\nother restricted payments; (vi) sell assets; (vii) issue or sell stock of certain subsidiaries; (viii) enter into transactions with shareholders or affiliates; and (ix) effect a\nconsolidation or merger.\nIn April 2021, we issued $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes (the \"Convertible Notes\"), that will mature on May 1, 2028, unless\nearlier converted, repurchased or redeemed. The principal included the full exercise of the option by the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes to purchase\n$11.3 million of additional principal amount. The Convertible Notes bear interest semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, at a rate of\n2.75% per annum in cash.\nIceland Term Facility\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary, Grundartangi, entered into a Term Facility Agreement with Arion Bank hf, dated September 2022, (the \"Iceland Term Facility\")\nto provide for borrowings up to €13.6 million. Under the Iceland Term Facility, repayments of principal amounts were made in equal monthly installments, the first\npayment occurring in February 2023, with the remainder of the principal amount paid in January 2024. Borrowings under the Iceland Term Facility bore interest at\na rate equal to 3.2% plus EUR EURIBOR 1 month as published at any time by the European Money Markets Institute. The Iceland Term Facility has been repaid in\nfull and has terminated pursuant to its terms in the first quarter of 2024.\nVlissingen Credit Facility\nOn December 9, 2022, Vlissingen entered into a $90.0 million Facility Agreement with Glencore International AG, which was amended and extended on\nOctober 1, 2024. The availability period for borrowings under the Vlissingen Credit Facility was extended by two years and now ends on December 2, 2026.\nPursuant to the terms of the Vlissingen Credit Facility, Vlissingen may borrow from time to time up to $90.0 million in one or more loans at a fixed interest rate\nequal to 8.75% per annum (the \"Fixed Rate\"), or (ii) a variable interest rate equal to the 1-month SOFR rate plus 3.687 percentage points, subject to an absolute\nmaximum level of 9.00% and an absolute minimum level of 7.00%. The Fixed Rate is only applicable to borrowings made on or before December 1, 2024, after\nwhich the Variable Rate shall apply to all borrowings under the Vlissingen Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, there were $10.0 million in outstanding\nborrowings under the Vlissingen Credit Facility.\nThe obligations under the Vlissingen Credit Facility are secured by liens on the ground lease on which Vlissingen's facilities are located, Vlissingen's moveable\nassets, financial assets, receivables and other assets, and Vlissingen’s shares. The Vlissingen Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including with respect to\nmergers, guarantees and preservation and dispositions of assets. Amounts drawn, if any, under the Vlissingen Credit Facility are expected to be used for general\ncorporate and working capital purposes of Century and its subsidiaries.\n39\nTable of Contents\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nThe Company has filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the \"Universal Shelf Registration Statement\") with the SEC pursuant to which the Company\nmay, from time to time, offer an indeterminate amount of securities, which may include securities that are guaranteed by certain of the Company's subsidiaries. As\nof September 30, 2024, we have not issued any debt securities pursuant to the Universal Shelf Registration Statement. However, any securities that we may issue in\nthe future may limit our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock.\n\"Guarantor Subsidiaries\" refers to all of our material domestic subsidiaries except for Nordural US LLC, Century Aluminum Development LLC, Century\nAluminum of West Virginia, Inc. and Century Aluminum Jamaica Holdings, Inc. The Guarantor Subsidiaries are 100% owned by Century. All guarantees will be\njoint and several, full and unconditional. Our foreign subsidiaries, together with Nordural US LLC, Century Aluminum Development LLC, Century Aluminum of\nWest Virginia, Inc. and Century Aluminum Jamaica Holdings, Inc. are collectively referred to as the \"Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.\" We allocate corporate expenses\nor income to our subsidiaries and charge interest on certain intercompany balances.\nThe following summarized financial information of both the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries (\"Guarantors\") is presented on a combined basis.\nIntercompany balances and transactions between the Company and the Guarantors have been eliminated and the summarized financial information does not reflect\ninvestments of the Company or the Guarantors in the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries (\"Non-Guarantors\"). The Company’s or Guarantors’ amounts due from, amounts\ndue to, and transactions with the Non-Guarantors are disclosed below:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCurrent assets $ 382.9 $ 361.5\nNon-current assets 710.1 648.6\nCurrent liabilities 249.8 253.6\nNon-current liabilities 501.8 485.7\nNine months Ended September 30,\n2024\nNet sales $ 1,269.3\nGross profit 106.7\nIncome before income taxes 65.1\nNet income 291.7\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, an intercompany receivable due to the Company and Guarantors from the Non-Guarantors totaled\n$98.0 million and $48.7 million, respectively, and an intercompany non-current loan due to the Company from the Non-Guarantors totaled $351.0 million and\n$384.9 million, respectively. An intercompany current loan due to the Company from the Non-Guarantors totaled $2.9 million as of December 31, 2023, and as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 there was no outstanding balance on this loan.\nContingent Commitments\nWe have a contingent obligation in connection with the \"unwind\" of a contractual arrangement between Century Aluminum of Kentucky (\"CAKY\"), Big\nRivers Electric Corporation and a third party and the execution in July 2009 of a long-term cost-based power contract with Kenergy, a member of a cooperative of\nBig Rivers. This contingent obligation consists of the aggregate payments made to Big Rivers by the third party on CAKY’s behalf in excess of the agreed upon\nbase amount under the long-term cost-based power contract with Kenergy. As of September 30, 2024, the principal and accrued interest for the contingent\nobligation was $32.0 million, which was fully offset by a derivative asset. We may be required to make installment payments for the contingent obligation in the\nfuture. These payments are contingent based on the LME price of primary aluminum and the level of Hawesville’s operations. As of September 30, 2024, based on\nthe LME forward market prices and our expected level of Hawesville operations, we believe that we will not be required to make payments on the contingent\nobligation during the term of the agreement, which expires in 2028. There can be no assurance that circumstances will not change thus accelerating the timing of\nsuch payments.\nEmployee Benefit Plan Contributions\nIn 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the \"PBGC\") regarding an alleged \"cessation of operations\" at\nour Ravenswood facility (the \"PBGC Settlement Agreement\"). Pursuant to the terms of the PBGC Settlement Agreement, we agreed to make additional\ncontributions (above any minimum required contributions) to our\n40\nTable of Contents\ndefined benefit pension plans totaling approximately $17.4 million. Under certain circumstances, in periods of lower primary aluminum prices relative to our cost\nof operations, we were able to defer one or more of these payments, provided that we provide the PBGC with acceptable security for such deferred payments. We\nhistorically elected to defer certain payments under the PBGC Settlement Agreement and provided the PBGC with the appropriate security. In October 2021, we\namended the PBGC Settlement Agreement (the \"Amended PBGC Settlement Agreement\") such that we removed the deferral mechanism and agreed to contribute\napproximately $2.4 million per year to our defined benefit pension plans for a total of approximately $9.6 million, over four years beginning on November 30, 2022\nand ending on November 30, 2025, subject to acceleration if certain terms and conditions are met in such amendment. As of September 30, 2024, we made\ncontributions of $7.2 million related to the Amended PBGC Settlement Agreement. We did not make any contributions for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2024.\nSection 232 Aluminum Tariff\nOn March 23, 2018, the U.S. implemented a 10% tariff on imported primary aluminum products into the U.S. These tariffs are intended to protect U.S. national\nsecurity and incentivize the restart of primary aluminum production in the U.S., reducing reliance on imports and ensuring that domestic producers, like Century,\ncan supply all the aluminum necessary for critical industries and national defense. In addition to primary aluminum products, the tariffs also cover certain other\nsemi-finished products. All imports that directly compete with our products are covered by the tariff, with the exception of imports from Australia, Canada and\nMexico. Additionally, primary aluminum imports from Argentina are allowed up to an annual quota limit of 169,000 metric tonnes, the first 18,000 metric tonnes of\nimports from the European Union and the first 900 metric tonnes of imports from the United Kingdom are also allowed duty free. Imports that receive a product\nexclusion from the Department of Commerce may also enter the US duty free. In July 2022, the International Trade Commission (ITC) initiated a review of the\nSection 301 and 232 duties as required by law every four years.\nOn March 15, 2023, the ITC submitted a report to the United States Congress entitled, 'Economic Impact of Section 232 and 301 Tariffs on U.S. Industries,' in\nwhich the ITC found that the tariffs increased the production of domestic aluminum while causing prices to increase by less than two percent. Accordingly, we do\nnot believe there will be any material changes to the current tariffs in the near future.\nSection 301 Tariffs\nOn May 22, 2024, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) issued a proposal (the “Proposal”) to implement new\ntariffs on certain items and increase existing tariffs on other items imported from China pursuant to USTR’s authority under\nSection 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The new and increased tariffs were adopted pursuant to the USTR’s authority to\ninvestigate unfair trade barriers and impose measures to counteract a foreign country’s unfair or discriminatory trade practices.\nUnder the Proposal, tariffs on aluminum imported from China are expected to increase to 25% from the current 7.5% tariff\nimposed in 2018. The increased tariff is in addition to the 10% tariff imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. The new and increased Section 301\ntariffs are only applicable to imports with China as the country of origin.\nOther Items\nIn August 2022, President Biden signed the IRA into law. The IRA provides for substantial tax credits and incentives for the development of critical minerals\n(including aluminum), renewable energy, clean fuels, electric vehicles, and supporting infrastructure, among other provisions. Section 45X of the IRA contains a\nproduction tax credit equal to 10% of certain eligible production costs, including, without limitation, labor, energy, depreciation and amortization and overhead\nexpenses. On October 24, 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released final rules to provide guidance on the production\ntax credit requirements under Internal Revenue Code Section 45X (the “Proposed Regulations”). The Final Regulations provide guidance on rules that taxpayers\nmust satisfy to qualify for the Section 45X tax credit. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $47.3 million and $69.9 million as a\nreduction in Cost of goods sold and $0.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively, as a reduction in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations, resulting in an equally offsetting receivable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recognized a\nManufacturing credit receivable of $78.8 million and $59.3 million, respectively, and as of September 30, 2024, we recognized a Non-current Manufacturing credit\nreceivable of $52.4 million within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDuring 2021, we announced plans for construction of a new billet casthouse at Grundartangi. The Grundartangi casthouse project began in late 2021 and was\ncompleted during the second quarter of 2024. The Grundartangi casthouse project was funded primarily through the Casthouse Facility. The project is complete and\nbillets have started to ship from the casthouse in the second half of 2024.\n41\nTable of Contents\nIn 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a $60.0 million common stock repurchase program and during the first quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors\nincreased the size of the program by $70.0 million. Under the program, Century is authorized to repurchase up to $130.0 million of our outstanding shares of\ncommon stock, from time to time, on the open market at prevailing market prices, in block trades or otherwise. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased\nwill be determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and other factors. We made no\nrepurchases during the years ended 2021, 2022, and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had $43.7 million remaining under the repurchase program authorization.\nThe repurchase program may be expanded, suspended or discontinued by our Board, in its sole discretion, at any time.\nIn November 2009, Century Aluminum of West Virginia, Inc. (\"CAWV\") filed a class action complaint for declaratory judgment against the United Steel, Paper\nand Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (\"USW\"), the USW’s local and certain CAWV retirees,\nindividually and as class representatives (\"CAWV Retirees\"), seeking a declaration of CAWV’s rights to modify/terminate retiree medical benefits. Later in\nNovember 2009, the USW and representatives of a retiree class filed a separate suit against CAWV, Century Aluminum Company, Century Aluminum Master\nWelfare Benefit Plan, and various John Does with respect to the foregoing. On August 18, 2017, the District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia\napproved a settlement agreement in respect of these actions, pursuant to which, CAWV agreed to make payments into a trust for the benefit of the CAWV Retirees\nin the aggregate amount of $23.0 million over the course of ten years. Upon approval of the settlement, we paid $5.0 million to the aforementioned trust in\nSeptember 2017 and agreed to pay the remaining amounts under the settlement agreement in annual increments of $2.0 million for nine years. At September 30,\n2024, we had $2.0 million in other current liabilities and $1.5 million in other liabilities related to this agreement.\nWe are a defendant in several actions relating to various aspects of our business. While it is impossible to predict the ultimate disposition of any litigation, we\ndo not believe that any of these lawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations\nor liquidity. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.\nCapital Resources\nWe intend to finance our future capital expenditures from available cash, cash flows from operations and if necessary, borrowing under our existing revolving\ncredit facilities. For major investment projects we would likely seek financing from various capital and loan markets and may potentially pursue the formation of\nstrategic alliances. We may be unable, however, to issue additional debt or equity securities, or enter into other financing arrangements on attractive terms, or at all,\ndue to a number of factors including a lack of demand, unfavorable pricing, poor economic conditions, unfavorable interest rates, or our financial condition or\ncredit rating at the time. Future uncertainty in the U.S. and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to access the debt or\ncapital markets and our financial condition.\nCapital expenditures incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $35.3 million, including expenditures related to the Jamalco port repair, but\nexcludes expenditures of $33.8 million associated with the Grundartangi casthouse project. We estimate our total remaining capital spending in 2024 will be\napproximately $10 to $15 million, related to our ongoing investment and sustainability projects at our aluminum smelters and alumina refinery.\n42\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nCommodity Price and Raw Material Costs Sensitivities\nAluminum is an internationally traded commodity, and its price is effectively determined on the LME plus any regional premium (e.g. the Midwest premium\nfor aluminum sold in the United States and the European Duty Paid premium for metal sold into Europe) and any value-added product premiums. From time to\ntime, we may manage our exposure to fluctuations in the LME price of primary aluminum and/or associated regional premiums through financial instruments\ndesigned to protect our downside price risk exposure. From time to time, we also enter into financial contracts to offset fixed price sales arrangements with certain\nof our customers (the \"fixed for floating swaps\").\nWe are also exposed to price risk for alumina which is one of the largest components of our cost of goods sold. Certain portions of the alumina we purchase is\npriced based on a published alumina index. As a result, our cost structure is exposed to market fluctuations and price volatility. Because we sell our products based\nprincipally on the LME price for primary aluminum, regional premiums and value-added product premiums, we are not able to directly pass on increased\nproduction costs to our customers. From time to time, we may manage our exposure to fluctuations in our alumina costs by purchasing certain of our alumina\nrequirements under supply contracts with prices tied to the same indices as our aluminum sales contracts (the LME price of primary aluminum).\nMarket-Based Power Price Sensitivity\nMarket-Based Electrical Power Agreements\nHawesville and Sebree have a market-based electrical power agreement pursuant to which Kenergy purchases electrical power on the open market and passes it\nthrough at MISO energy pricing, plus transmission and other costs incurred by them. See Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial\nstatements included herein for additional information about these market-based power agreements.\nPower is supplied to Grundartangi from hydroelectric and geothermal sources under long-term power purchase agreements. These power purchase agreements,\nwhich will expire on various dates from 2026 through 2036 (subject to extension), currently provide power at LME-based variable rates for 70% of Grundartangi's\npower requirements. The remaining 30% of Grundartangi's power requirements is primarily at fixed rates plus a small variable rate portion.\nFrom time to time, we may manage our exposure to fluctuations in the market price of power through financial instruments designed to protect our downside\nrisk exposure.\nElectrical Power Price Sensitivity\nGiven our market-based power supply agreements, we have electrical power price risk for our operations, whether due to fluctuations in the price of power\navailable on the MISO power market or the price of natural gas. Power represents one of our largest operating costs, so changes in the price and/or availability of\nmarket power could significantly impact the profitability and viability of our operations. Transmission line outages, problems with grid stability or limitations on\nenergy import capability could also increase power prices, disrupt production through pot instability or force a curtailment of all or part of the production at these\nfacilities. In addition, indirect factors that lead to power cost increases, such as any increasing prices for natural gas or coal, fluctuations in or extremes in weather\npatterns or new or more stringent environmental regulations may severely impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThe consumption shown in the table below reflects each operation at 100% production capacity and does not reflect production curtailments.\nElectrical power price sensitivity by location:\nHawesville Sebree Mt.

Grundartangi’s labor costs, part of its maintenance costs and other local services are denominated in ISK and a\nportion of its anode costs are denominated in Euros and Chinese renminbi. We also have deposits denominated in ISK in Icelandic banks and our estimated\npayments of Icelandic income taxes and any associated refunds are denominated in ISK. Vlissingen's labor costs, maintenance costs, and other local services are\ndenominated in Euros. Further, Jamalco's labor costs, maintenance costs, and other local services are denominated in Jamaican dollars. We also have deposits\ndenominated in Jamaican dollars in Jamaican banks and our estimated payments of Jamaican income taxes and any associated refunds are denominated in Jamaican\ndollars. As a result, an increase or decrease in the value of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would affect Grundartangi’s, Vlissingen's and Jamalco's\noperating margins.\nWe may manage our foreign currency exposure by entering into foreign currency forward contracts or option contracts for forecasted transactions and projected\ncash flows for foreign currencies in future periods. We have entered into financial contracts to hedge the risk of fluctuations associated with the ISK and Euro under\nour casthouse currency hedges.\nNatural Economic Hedges\nAny analysis of our exposure to the commodity price of aluminum should consider the impact of natural hedges provided by certain contracts that contain\npricing indexed to the LME price for primary aluminum. Certain alumina contracts and a substantial portion of Grundartangi’s electrical power requirements are\nindexed to the LME price for primary aluminum and provide a natural hedge for a portion of our production.\nRisk Management\nAny metals, power, natural gas and foreign currency risk management activities are subject to the control and direction of senior management within guidelines\nestablished by Century’s Board of Directors. These activities are regularly reported to Century’s Board of Directors.\n44\nTable of Contents\nFair Values and Sensitivity Analysis\nThe following tables present the fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and the effect on the fair value of a hypothetical ten\npercent (10%) adverse change in the market prices in effect at September 30, 2024.

Controls and Procedures\na. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our management, including the\nChief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\nb. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOn May 2, 2023, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Century Aluminum Jamaica Holdings, Inc. (\"CAJH\"), completed the acquisition of all the outstanding share\ncapital of General Alumina Holdings Limited (\"GAHL\"), the indirect holder of a 55% interest in Jamalco, an unincorporated joint venture engaged in bauxite\nmining and alumina production in Jamaica. We have implemented internal controls over significant processes specific to Jamalco that management believes are\nappropriate in consideration of related integration of operations, systems, and control activities. Except as described in preceding sentence relating to integration of\ninternal controls specific to Jamalco, as of September 30, 2024 there were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting.\n46\nTable of Contents\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nWe are a party from time to time in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business, the outcomes of which, in the opinion of management,\nneither individually nor in the aggregate are likely to result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. For information\nregarding material legal proceedings pending against us at September 30, 2024, refer to Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial\nstatements included herein.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024. You should carefully consider the risk\nfactors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings made with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties\nnot currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\n47\nTable of Contents\nItem 5. Other Information\nDisclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act\nSection 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (“ITRA”), effective August 10, 2012, added a new subsection (r) to Section 13\nof the Exchange Act, which requires issuers that file periodic reports with the SEC to disclose in their annual and quarterly reports whether, during the reporting\nperiod, they or any of their “affiliates” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) have knowingly engaged in specified activities or transactions relating to\nIran, including activities not prohibited by U.S. law and conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable laws. Issuers must also file\na notice with the SEC if any disclosable activity under ITRA has been included in an annual or quarterly report.\nBecause the SEC defines the term “affiliate” broadly, our largest stockholder may be considered an affiliate of the Company despite the fact that the Company\nhas no control over its largest stockholder’s actions or the actions of its affiliates. As such, pursuant to Section 13(r)(1)(D)(iii) of the Exchange Act, the Company\nhereby discloses the following information provided by our largest stockholder regarding transactions or dealings with entities controlled by the Government of Iran\n(“the GOI”):\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, non-U.S. affiliates of the largest stockholder of the Company (“the non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates”)\nentered into sales contracts for agricultural products with, or for delivery to or from Iranian entities wholly or majority owned by the GOI. The non-U.S.\nStockholder Affiliates performed their obligations under the contracts in compliance with applicable sanction laws and, where required, with the necessary\nprior approvals by the relevant governmental authorities.\nThe gross revenue of the non-U.S Stockholder Affiliates related to the contracts did not exceed the value of USD $74 million for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nThe non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates do not allocate net profit on a country-by-country or activity-by-activity basis, but estimate that the net profit\nattributable to the contracts would not exceed a small fraction of the gross revenue from such contracts. It is not possible to determine accurately the\nprecise net profit attributable to such contracts.\nThe contracts disclosed above do not violate applicable sanctions laws administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets\nControl, and are not the subject of any enforcement action under Iran sanction laws.\nThe non-U.S. Stockholder Affiliates expect to continue to engage in similar activities in the future in compliance with applicable economic sanctions and\nin conformity with U.S. secondary sanctions.\nThe Company and its global subsidiaries had no transactions or activities requiring disclosure under ITRA, nor were we involved in the transactions described\nin this section. As of the date of this report, the Company is not aware of any other activity, transaction or dealing by it or any of its affiliates during the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, that requires disclosure in this report under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.\nSecurities Trading Plans of Directors and Officers\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company who is required to file reports under Section 16 of the\nExchange Act has informed us that he or she has adopted, modified, or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\n48\nTable of Contents\nItem 6.

          "content": "Century Aluminum Company\n3rd Quarter Earnings Call\nNovember 4, 2024\nCautionary Statement\nCertain statements in this presentation, and those made by Century Aluminum Company management on the quarterly conference call, relate to future events and\nexpectations and are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\"\n\"hope,\" \"target,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"seek,\" \"estimate,\" \"potential,\" \"project,\" \"scheduled,\" \"forecast\" or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs\nsuch as \"will,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"might,\" or \"may” often identify forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-\nlooking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding our outlook, assumptions, projections, forecasts or trend descriptions. These statements do not\nguarantee future performance and speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of\nnew information, future events, or otherwise. Where we express an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good\nfaith and is believed to have a reasonable basis. However, our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks\nand uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed, projected or implied by those forward-looking statements. Important\nfactors that could cause actual results and events to differ from those described in such forward-looking statements can be found in the risk factors and forward-looking\nstatements cautionary language contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in other filings made with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”). Although we have attempted to identify material factors that could cause actual results or events to differ from those described in such\nforward-looking statements, there may be other factors that could cause actual results or events to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended. Many of these\nfactors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Given these uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.\nOur forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements with respect to: future global and domestic financial and economic conditions; the outlook for the\nglobal aluminum and alumina markets including benchmark and premium pricing levels; our assessment of U.S. and European energy and power markets; costs\nassociated with our other key raw materials, and supply and availability of those key raw materials, including power (and related natural gas and coal); our assessment\nof power price and availability for our U.S. and European operations including the likelihood and extent of any power curtailments; the impact of the wars in Ukraine\nand in the Middle East, including any related impacts on global energy markets and/or any sanctions and export controls targeting Russia and businesses tied to\nRussia and to sanctioned entities and individuals, including any possible impact on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations and global supply\nchains; the future financial and operating performance of Century and its subsidiaries; our ability to successfully manage market risk and to control or reduce costs; our\nplans and expectations with respect to future operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, including any plans and expectations to curtail or restart production,\nincluding the expected impact of any such actions on our future financial and operating performance; our plans and expectations with regards to future operations of\nour Mt. Holly smelter, including our expectations as to the restart of curtailed production at Mt. Holly, including the timing, costs and benefits associated with restarting\ncurtailed production; our plans with regards to future operations of our Hawesville smelter; Our plans and expectations with regards to the Grundartangi casthouse\nproject, including our expectations as to the costs and benefits associated with the Grundartangi casthouse project; our plans and expectations with respect to the\nacquisition of a 55% interest in Jamalco, including our expectations as to the costs and benefits associated with Jamalco’s operations; our ability to successfully obtain\nand/or retain competitive power arrangements for our operations; our ability to qualify for and realize potential tax benefits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022;\nour ability to realize the full amount of the DOE $500 million grant, to negotiate favorable terms and conditions related to such grant, to raise additional capital through\nadditional grants, incentives, subsidized loans and other debt and equity funding to support construction of a new aluminum smelter; our ability to access existing or\nfuture financing arrangements and the terms of any such future financing arrangements; our ability to repay or refinance debt in the future; and other factors described\nin more detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in our other SEC filings.\nIn addition, throughout this presentation, we use non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the\nmeasures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in\nisolation or as substitutes for results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the Appendix of\ntoday’s presentation.\n1\nSpeakers\n• Jesse Gary – President and Chief Executive Officer\n• Jerry Bialek – Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n• Peter Trpkovski – Senior Vice President, Finance and Treasurer\n2\nCompany and Market Update\n• Aluminum prices rose sharply to end Q3 on central bank actions and Chinese stimulus measures\nIndustry\n• Alumina supply remains tight, driving prices to multi-year highs and supporting higher aluminum prices\nFundamentals\n• Global inventory levels continue to stay near historical lows\n• Final Section 45X rules clarify carbon and other operating supplies eligible for 10% production tax credit;\nalumina remains open\nCosts • Jamalco acquisition eliminated CENX net exposure to spot alumina prices;

These non-GAAP financial measures\nfacilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods on a consistent asis y ad usting for items that\nmanagement does not elieve are indicative of Century’s ongoing operating performance and a ility to generate cash.\nManagement believes these non-GAA financial measures enhance an overall understanding of Century’s performance\nand our investors’ a ility to review Century’s usiness from the same perspective as management.\nThe following slides provide a reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) and adjusted EBITDA\nto the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to,\nand not as an alternative for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not\nall companies use identical calculations, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share and adjusted\nEBITDA included in the following slides may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors\nare encouraged to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures.\nThis presentation also provides forward-looking adjusted EBITDA. We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking\nadjusted EBITDA because the most closely comparable GAAP financial measure is not accessible on a forward-looking\nbasis and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting\nand quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such a reconciliation.\nWe do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA because the corresponding forward-looking GAAP\nfinancial measures is not currently available and management cannot reliably predict all the necessary components of\nsuch forward-looking GAAP measures without unreasonable effort or expense due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting\nand quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such a reconciliation, including adjustments that could be made for\nrestructuring, the variability of our tax rate, the impact of foreign currency fluctuation, and other charges reflected in our\nhistorical results. The probable significance of each of these items is high and, based on historical experience, could be\nmaterial.\n13\nAdjusted Net (Loss) Income Attributable to\nCentury Non-GAAP Reconciliation\nQ224 Q324\n$MM EPS $MM EPS\nNet (loss) income attributable to Century stockholders $ (2.5) $ (0.03) $ 47.3 $ 0.51\nLess: net (loss) income allocated to participating securities - - 2.5 0.03\nNet income (loss) allocated to common stockholders (2.5) (0.03) 44.8 0.48\nLower of cost or NRV inventory adjustment, net of tax (2.0) (0.02) - -\nUnrealized loss (gain) on derivative contracts, net of tax 1.7 0.02 1.9 0.02\nShare-based compensation 3.5 0.04 3.2 0.03\nJamalco hurricane impact1 - - 6.9 0.07\nImpact of preferred and convertible shares - - 3.2 0.03\nAdjusted net (loss) income attributable to Century stockholders $ 0.7 $ 0.01 $ 60.0 $ 0.63\nWeighted Average # Shares Outstanding Q224 Q324\nCommon 92.7 92.8\nPreferred 5.2 5.2\nConvertible 4.6 4.6\nTotal 102.5 102.6\n1) This amount includes Century's 55% share of incremental costs incurred due to the impact of Hurricane Beryl at Jamalco.\nThese costs include repair costs of the damaged port, costs of alternative shipping arrangements and fixed costs incurred\nwhile alumina production was impeded. . 14\nAdjusted EBITDA Non-GAAP Reconciliation\n$MM Q224 Q324\nNet (loss) income attributable to Century stockholders $ (2.5) $ 47.3\nAdd: Net (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (4.2) (5.0)\nNet (loss) income (6.7) 42.3\nInterest expense 10.3 11.9\nInterest income (0.6) (0.4)\nNet loss (gain) on forward and derivative contracts 4.0 4.0\nOther (income) expense – net (1.1) 4.0\nIncome tax expense 0.5 2.0\nOperating income $ 6.4 $ 63.8\nLower of cost or NRV inventory adjustment (1.8) -\nShare-based compensation 3.5 3.2\nJamalco hurricane impact1 - 12.6\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization 21.9 24.8\nAdjusted EBITDA 30.0 104.4\nLess: Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests (4.2) 0.7\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to Century stockholders $ 34.2 $ 103.7\nSupplemental Information Q224 Q324\nPot Relining Expense2 $ 11.3 $ 7.3\n1) This amount includes Century's 100% share of incremental costs incurred due to the impact of Hurricane Beryl at Jamalco.

Thank you for attending today's Century Aluminum Company Third Quarter\n2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sierra, and I'll be your moderator for today. All\nlines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions\nand answers at the end. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to pass the conference over to Ryan Crawford.\nRyan Crawford\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the conference call. I'm joined\nhere today by Jesse Gary, Century's President and Chief Executive Officer; Jerry Bialek,\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Peter Trpkovski, Senior Vice\nPresident of Finance and Treasurer.\nAfter our prepared comments, we will take your questions. As a reminder, today's presentation\nis available on our website at www.centuryaluminum.com. We use our website as a means of\ndisclosing material information about the company and for complying with Regulation FD.\nTurning to Slide 1, please take a moment to review the cautionary statements shown here with\nrespect to forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures contained in today's\ndiscussion.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call to Jesse.\nJesse Gary\nThanks Ryan and thanks to everyone for joining.\nBefore we get started, we are very sad to report a safety incident that resulted in a fatality at\nour Mt. Holly smelter. The loss of a team member is devastating to all of us at Century, and it\nis especially painful given our collective commitment and focus on safety. Our late colleague's\nfamily will remain firmly in our thoughts and prayers.\nThis event reinforces the need for us to critically examine how we operate and conduct\nourselves and commit to making needed improvements without condition. It will require\ndedication and leadership from every part of our organization and a personal commitment from\neach and every one of us.\nOkay, I’ll start the call today by reviewing the strong current aluminum and alumina market\nconditions before turning to our excellent third quarter performance. I’ll also discuss the\nadditional benefits we will receive under the new Section 45X guidance before Jerry takes you\nthrough the detailed financial results. I’ll then wrap up and open the call for questions.\nCentury produced excellent results in the third quarter, generating Adjusted EBITDA of\n$104MM, which includes the impact of the updated 45X guidance. Overall, improving realized\naluminum prices, both at the LME and regional premium level, and falling carbon prices, drove\nincreased profitability in the quarter and will continue to benefit our fourth quarter\nperformance. As a reminder, LME prices roll through our results on a three-month lagged basis,\nso the benefit from recent spot prices above $2600 per tonne will not positively impact our\nfinancial results until Q1 of next year.\nTurning to slide 4, global aluminum prices were largely rangebound during the third quarter\nbefore Western central bank actions and Chinese stimulus drove both LME and regional\npremiums higher. In late September, China announced a number of monetary and fiscal\nstimulus programs that drove an immediate improvement in global aluminum prices, which\nrose to average $2600 per tonne in October.\nTurning to slide 5, global demand has already been at record levels in 2024, driven by strong\nglobal trends towards electrification and lightweighting. Overall, we estimate that 2024 global\ndemand growth of 3% will accelerate further in 2025 as western markets begin to improve on\nthe backs of central bank action, and Chinese demand growth continues to accelerate as\nstimulus programs and funds are disbursed.\nMeanwhile, aluminum supply remains challenged, with China approaching its 45 million tonne\nproduction cap, and limited announced new projects outside of China. We believe demand\ngrowth will continue to outpace supply in 2025 and for years to come, moving the market back\ninto deficit. With inventories already near multiyear lows, these supply deficits should continue\nto create a favorable aluminum price environment in the coming years.\nTurning to the bauxite and alumina markets, the spot Atlantic alumina price today stands at\n$715 per tonne, an all-time record. Alumina prices continued their upward march in Q3 and\ninto Q4 as a number of market disruptions paired with low alumina inventory levels globally\nhave created a very tight market. There have been a number of supply disruptions this year in\nAustralia, from the Kwinana refinery curtailment to force majeure events and regulatory issues\nin bauxite permitting at a number of other Australian refineries. We have also seen refinery\ndisruptions in India, driven by both regulatory and operational challenges.\nOn the bauxite side, China has become increasingly reliant on the seaborne bauxite market\ngiven a 16% decrease in year to date Chinese bauxite production following continued declines\nin domestic ore quality and increased safety and environmental inspections from regulators.\nBoth the bauxite and alumina markets have recently been impacted further by supply\ndisruptions out of Guinea, where one of the largest exporters announced a halt to bauxite\nshipments earlier this month following export permitting issues. To our knowledge, this issue\nremains unresolved and highlights how sensitive the bauxite and alumina markets remain to\ngeopolitics, with Guinea alone accounting for roughly 30% of global bauxite production and\naround 70% of Chinese imports.\nJust as a reminder, Century no longer has exposure to spot alumina prices following the\nacquisition of our controlling interest in Jamalco, with all of our smelter alumina requirements\nsourced directly from Jamalco or under long-term LME linked supply contracts. Needless to\nsay, we are very happy to have Jamalco in our asset portfolio in markets like this.\nTurning to page 6, you can see that in the US and Jamaica, our major raw material price inputs\ncontinued to be constructive. Natural gas storage levels remain well situated heading into the\nwinter season, with inventories significantly above last year and near 5-year highs, leaving the\nforward curve well below $3 throughout the coming winter months. Gas prices at these levels\nshould be supportive for continued low Indy Hub energy prices well into next year.\nTurning to operations, we saw strong performance across our smelters in the third quarter.\nOperations at Sebree and Mt. Holly remained stable in Q3, which is a testament to our operating\nteams during these very hot end of summer months.\nWith respect to our Hawesville facility, we have received a number of significant third-party\ninquiries regarding potential redevelopment of the site. The site has several unique attributes,\nincluding its energy infrastructure, that make it attractive for potential acquirors, including,\namong others, its potential for AI data center development. While we still believe the site has\nsignificant value as an option for restart in higher aluminum price environments, we have\nengaged financial advisors and launched a formal process to evaluate strategic alternatives and\npotential value to help us in our overall evaluation of the site. We will keep you updated on\nprogress here.\nIn Iceland, low rainfall and snowmelt over the summer months have left reservoirs below\nnormal levels and led power suppliers to announce curtailments, including Grundartangi,\nthrough May of 2025. We currently expect these curtailments will reduce our power\nconsumption by about 30MW in Q4. Volume at Grundartangi should be flat in Q4 vs Q3 as\nthese curtailments were implemented in the third quarter. The financial impact of the\ncurtailment is included in our outlook on page 11 and our updated full-year volume guidance\nis in the appendix of this presentation.\nAt Jamalco, the refinery has fully recovered from the impact of Hurricane Beryl in early July.\nThe team did an excellent job quickly restoring the plant to normal production levels and\ncompleting required repairs on the port facilities, which returned to normal service in mid-\nSeptember.\nI would like to congratulate the Jamalco team for their exceptional management through the\nhurricane and its aftermath. Completing the port repairs quickly, safely and without injury is\nreally quite an achievement.\nTurning to page 7, late last month, the Department of the Treasury published final regulations\nimplementing Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided additional clarity\non the eligibility of certain of our costs for the 10% production tax credit.\nWe were pleased that the final rules added certain direct and indirect materials as eligible costs\nfor the production tax credit, as we and others had requested in our comments. For aluminum\nproduction, the most significant costs that are now eligible are coke, pitch and other operating\nsupplies. From these newly eligible categories, we realized an additional benefit of $22MM in\n2023 and $13MM YTD in 2024. Jerry will walk you through the details in a moment.\nThe final regulations left open the question as to whether alumina will be an eligible production\ncost, reserving this question for further consideration with updated guidance to be published at\na later time.\nWe will continue to work with the Treasury Department regarding inclusion of alumina as an\neligible cost for 45X, as there is strong justification that alumina should ultimately be eligible\nfor the tax credit. If alumina is included, that would increase our 45X credit by about $30\nmillion annually.\nJerry will now walk you through the details on 45X, the quarter and our Q4 outlook.\nGerald “Jerry” Bialek\nThank you, Jesse. Let’s turn to slide 8 to review third quarter results. On a consolidated\nbasis, third quarter global shipments were approximately 169,000 tonnes, slightly\nhigher than last quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $539 million, a decrease of $22\nmillion sequentially. This was driven by lower third-party alumina sales due to the port\nrepairs at Jamalco, partially offset by higher realized metal prices and regional delivery\npremiums.\nLooking at Q3 operating results, adjusted EBITDA attributable to Century was $104\nmillion. The $70 million sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by\nadditional 45X tax credits, higher realized prices, and lower raw material costs.\nAdjusted net income was $60 million or $0.63 per share. The main adjusting items\nwere add-backs of $7 million for Hurricane Beryl related costs at Jamalco that we told\nyou about last call, $3 million for share-based compensation and $2 million for the\nunrealized impact of forward derivative contracts.\nLiquidity was $279 million to end the third quarter. This consisted of $33 million in\ncash and $246 million available on our credit facilities. Our liquidity position remains\nwithin our target range but decreased last quarter primarily due to inventory builds at\nJamalco and the timing of alumina shipments while port repairs were being completed.\nWe expect those to reverse in Q4 as a full quarter of normal shipments out of the\nJamalco port will return inventory to target levels, increasing liquidity.\nTurning to slide 9 to explain third quarter sequential improvement in adjusted\nEBITDA. In total, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $104 million. Realized\nLME of $2,451 per tonne was up $163 versus prior quarter, while realized US Midwest\nPremium of $421 per tonne was up $5 and European Delivery Premium of $335 per\ntonne was up $52. Together, higher metal prices and regional premiums contributed\nan incremental $31 million compared with the prior quarter.\nWe also realized favorable raw material costs adding $7 million of EBITDA. The\nfavorable market prices and raw material costs were partially offset with slightly\nhigher power prices, a headwind of $3 million.\nThe new 45X rules from the Treasury Department addressing carbon and other\noperating supplies result in an additional $22 million credit for the full-year 2023 and\nan additional $13 million credit for the 2024 year-to-date. These tax credit amounts\nare additive to the 45X tax credit that has already been recorded each quarter since the\noriginal guidance was released in December 2023. In total, this brought our Q3\nadjusted EBITDA to $104 million. With that, let’s turn to slide 10 for a look at cash\nflow.\nWe began the quarter with $41 million in cash. Adjusted EBITDA contributed $104\nmillion. Capital expenditures totaled $23 million, which was largely driven by cash\noutlays for the completed Jamalco port repairs following Hurricane Beryl. Hurricane\nBeryl also impacted working capital during the quarter, causing a delay in alumina\nshipments from our Jamalco refinery that will correct in the fourth quarter. Finally, the\ntotal 45X tax credit booked in the quarter increased the tax credit receivable on our\nbalance sheet until the direct cash payments are received. Through September 30, we\nhave a 45X receivable of $133 million awaiting payment from the US government. At\nthe end of quarter 3, we had $33 million in cash.\nLet’s turn to slide 11 and for insights into our expectations for the fourth quarter. For\nQ4, the lagged LME of $2,430 per tonne is expected to be down about $20 versus Q3\nrealized prices. The Q4 lagged US Midwest Premium is forecast to be $425 per tonne,\nup $5. The European delivery premium is expected at $340 per tonne, or up about $5\nper tonne versus the third quarter. Taken together, the lagged LME, and delivery\npremium changes are expected to have a zero to $5 million decrease to Q4 EBITDA\ncompared with Q3 levels.\nWe expect power prices to remain constructive and to have a zero to $5 million\nEBITDA increase in Q4. Collectively, we expect our other key raw materials to be\nabout flat. Volume, operating expenses, and other administrative costs will be similar\nto last quarter. All factors considered, our outlook for Q4 adjusted EBITDA is\nexpected to be in a range between $70 to $80 million. As Jesse mentioned before,\ncurrent spot aluminum prices above $2,600 will not begin to positively impact our\nfinancial results until Q1 2025.\nAnd now, I’ll turn the call back over to Jesse.\nJesse Gary\nThanks Jerry. Before we turn the call over to questions, I want to spend a little bit more time\non Section 45X and our Jamalco acquisition, which together with the operational improvements\nour team has driven over the past several years, serve to increase the stability in Century’s\nbusinesses and earnings power.\nWith the inclusion of carbon and other operating supplies as eligible costs for the production\ntax credit, we now expect our total full year 2023 45X benefit to be $79MM and estimate our\ntotal full year 2024 45X benefit to be $73MM. If alumina is also ultimately included as eligible,\nwe would expect each of those amounts to increase by another $30MM or so, to total over $100\nmillion in benefit on an annualized basis.\nPlease note, these production tax credits for critical minerals do not phase out over time and\nwould be increased pro rata by any additional production that we may bring online in the U.S.\nThe effect of these credits is to significantly increase the quality and competitiveness of\nCentury’s businesses. When paired with our world-class workforce, our privileged positions\nin very undersupplied US and EU markets, as well as a globally competitive captive supply of\nalumina from Jamalco, you can see the quality of the earnings power of the business that we\nhave been working towards for quite some time now. We are really proud of what the team has\ncreated here at Century and believe this is a business that can now perform very well through\nthe cycles.\nWe look forward to your questions today and will turn the call over now to the operator.\nQuestions and Answers\nOperator\nThank you. We will now begin the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question\ntoday comes from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Your line is now open.\nLucas Pipes\nThank you very much, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. I have a fairly long list of\nquestions. I'll try to keep them short. But first, Jesse, could you speak a little bit to the process\nthat you have started for Hawesville? When did you kick off that process and when would you\nexpect to complete it? Thank you very much.\nJesse Gary\nSure, Lucas. Yeah. As I mentioned on the call, we've been looking at this for a little while now,\nand we did receive a number of inbound inquiries with interest in the site. And given the\ninterest level that we saw, we decided it made sense to start a process. Now, of course,\nrepurposing an industrial asset is a bit different than some of the other transactions you've seen\nin the market, and there is a number of items that will need to be diligenced by the buyers and\nvalued. And so we'll just have to watch and see how long that takes. But what we can say for\nnow is there is significant interest and the process will ultimately help us determine value and\nmake the right decision.\nLucas Pipes\nAll right. Well, we'll stay tuned for that. I want to touch on the LME-linked supply\nagreements with alumina really quickly. And Jesse, could you remind us kind of what\nsupply agreements you have in the market today? When they expire? And then from\nthere, I might have a few follow-ups. Thank you very much.\nJesse Gary\nSure. Yeah. We generally source all of our supply, as I said, either from Jamalco or from these\nlong-term supply agreements. The supply agreements, we don't disclose details of, but they are\nwith very creditworthy counterparties, and I think there's over two years left on those contracts\nbefore we'll need to renegotiate them.\nLucas Pipes\nSo this would include both Concord and Glencore, or might there be a difference between the\ntwo?\nJesse Gary\nWe won't break down the individual contracts, but as you can see from our results, the collective\nnature -- when you put them together, I guess is the way to say it and along with our own\ninternal capture supply we don't have any API exposure.\nLucas Pipes\nAnd that should also hold true for 2025.\nJesse Gary\nYes, in 2026 as well.\nLucas Pipes\nAll right. Very helpful. Thank you very much for that. In that context, strong aluminum pricing\nand supply stability on the alumina side price stability, why not move forward with capacity\nrestarts here and now?\nJesse Gary\nWell, that's a good question, Lucas. So as we've said for a while now, we want to look and\nmake sure that when we do make the decision to bring capacity back online, the market is ready\nfor it. So for one, we do see strong LME so that's a positive and we've seen rising Midwest\npremium prices as well over this quarter. But with respect to incremental volume, we would\nhave to go out into the market and source alumina. So there, we would be exposed to spot\nalumina for that new volume that we're bringing on. So just to be clear, no spot exposure for\nour existing operations at current levels. But if we were to bring on additional, we have to go\nout and find that alumina in the marketplace, and obviously, at spot prices, that's a bit of a\nhurdle.\nLucas Pipes\nI appreciate that color. I'll turn it over for now. Thank you very much.\nJesse Gary\nThanks, Lucas.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital. Your line is now open.\nKatja Jancic\nHi. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just going back to the alumina supply\nagreements. I think when I look at your filings, you have an agreement that is supposedly valid\nthrough the end of this year for 600,000 tons of alumina. Is that just -- does that just roll over,\nor what's the situation with us? Can you talk a little bit about that?\nJesse Gary\nYeah. That contract has been extended now, Katja, so that extends out for a couple of years\nfrom here.\nKatja Jancic\nAnd is that the same terms as it was in the past, or any changes there?\nJesse Gary\nYeah, similar terms, and as what's been there in the past.\nKatja Jancic\nAnd maybe moving to the value-added premiums. I think now is the time when you're\nnegotiating for next year. Any update on that side, how it's looking for next year?\nJesse Gary\nNo. As we've seen for the past couple of years, what we call the mating season extends a bit\nlonger into the fall than it used to maybe five years ago. So we're still out there in the market\nright now negotiating those contracts and expect to have an update on the Q4 call.\nKatja Jancic\nAnd one last one, if I may. You mentioned that repurposing an industrial asset comes with --\nit's a little different than some of the other assets. Can you talk a bit more about that like what\nare some of the potential challenges in repurposing these types of assets?\nJesse Gary\nWell, I think it's just as simple as -- I think some of the other transactions in the market you've\nseen has been one data center used for one type of data center application to maybe an AI\nhyperscaler or something like that, where you can just imagine you're turning over a data center\nbuilding with racks -- with server racks, et cetera. Whereas if you have an industrial asset,\nobviously, you used it for its industrial purpose. So we made aluminum. And so while there are\nassets that have significant value, like the electrical equipment and power infrastructure, there\nare other areas of the site that would need to be modified in order to work for such a purpose.\nAnd so I think as we move forward with the process, that's one area that the buyers are due\ndiligencing and will need to be evaluated in terms of sort of timing to a transaction.\nKatja Jancic\nSo if I'm understanding correctly, this would be in a way, a sale of the whole asset potentially.\nJesse Gary\nWe haven't settled on any structure, nor we settled on any transaction yet, Katja, and -- but that\nwould certainly be one potential outcome of the process.\nKatja Jancic\nOkay. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question today comes from John Tumazos with Very Independent Research. Your\nline is now open.\nJohn Tumazos\nThank you very much for taking my question.\nJesse Gary\nHey, John.\nJohn Tumazos\nWhen does the LME-linked contract expire? Who if you can say is the supplier? And could\nyou tell us if your alumina costs in Jamaica resemble world averages like what Alcoa, or other\ncompanies publish?\nJesse Gary\nSure, John. Let me try to take those in order. If I miss one, just redirect me. So the LME league\ncontracts are long-term. They're in place. There's a variety of them, but all of them are through\nat least 2026.\nWith respect to the Jamalco cost structure, as we've said in the past, we are very excited about\nthis asset. We think its cost structure will ultimately be globally competitive and what we said\nas we implement some of our CapEx programs, we do think it can be a second-quartile asset,\nwhich would put us right in the range of some of our competitors that you mentioned. And\nwe're already underway. We've been at it a year now and getting that cost structure down and\ncertainly looking good in today's market price environment.\nJohn Tumazos\nCongratulations. What you've done with alumina is absolutely superb.\nJesse Gary\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you all for your questions. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is a follow-up from\nLucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Your line is now open.\nLucas Pipes\nThank you very much for taking my follow-up question. Just one more on the alumina side. As\na percentage of LME, what was it roughly this year? Would it be stable next year? Or could\nthere be any adjustment given the recent surge in alumina prices?\nI want to echo John's comment. Congratulations on the acquisition of Jamalco and the structure\nof all the contracts you've done. But I wanted to follow up on this. Thank you.\nJesse Gary\nSure, Lucas. Yeah. I think your question relates to the commercial contracts, whether those\ncould change. And no, those are fixed percentages that were entered into before the current run-\nup and so they are quite attractive compared to current levels.\nLucas Pipes\nVery helpful. Thank you. And then –\nJesse Gary\nNo.\nLucas Pipes\nSorry?\nJesse Gary\nNo. I was just going to say no readjustment in those contracts. They're fixed.\nLucas Pipes\nThank you for that. Maybe trying to put it all together. Obviously, you've provided an outlook\nfor Q4 that is still reflecting a somewhat weaker price environment. Looking out to Q1 or a\n2025 EBITDA in the current price environment, could you help kind of frame up the sensitivity\nand what the earnings power might look like? Would appreciate the color. Thank you.\nJesse Gary\nHey, Lucas. So you all can just go to our sensitivities in the appendix and mark -- go ahead and\nmark whichever of the revenue side or cost side items you want. But just to walk you through\nit, Lucas. So as you see on Page 11, and the outlook was based on an LME around $2,400. And\nso with spots above $2,600, that's about $200 dollars per ton of incremental EBITDA, which\nis about $90 million of incremental EBITDA on a run-rate annualized basis. And then Midwest\npremium as well has risen from these levels. In the outlook, it's about $425 per ton. It's up a\ncouple of pennies from there. So that's maybe another $20 million or so.\nSo at spots, you've got an additional $100 million or so in annualized EBITDA from what's in\nthe guide. So you can take that $25 million a quarter and we put you above $100 million\nquarterly run-rate EBITDA.\nLucas Pipes\nI appreciate all the additional color. Jesse, to you and the team, continue best of luck.\nJesse Gary\nThanks a lot, Lucas.\nOperator\nThank you for your questions. There are no longer questions in queue so I'll pass the conference\nback to the management team for any further or closing remarks.\nJesse Gary\nThank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining the call. We really appreciate all the\nquestions as always and look forward to talking to you in the New Year. Thanks.\nOperator\nThat will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now\ndisconnect your line."
