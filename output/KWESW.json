Corporate information\na) Corporate information\nKWESST Micro Systems Inc. (the “Company”, “KWESST”, “we”, “our”, and “us”) was incorporated on\nNovember 28, 2017, under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. Our registered office is located at 550\nBurrard Street, Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and our corporate office is located at Unit 1,\n155 Terrence Matthews Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We have representative offices in the following\nforeign locations: Washington DC (United States), London (United Kingdom), and Abu Dhabi (United Arab\nEmirates).\nWe develop and commercialize next-generation technology solutions that deliver a tactical advantage for\nmilitary, public safety agencies and personal defense markets. Our core mission is to protect and save lives.\nKWESST’s common stock is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (“TSX-V’’) under the stock symbol of KWE,\non the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the stock symbol of KWE and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange\nunder the stock symbol of 62U. Additionally, warrants issued in the United States are also listed on the Nasdaq\nunder the stock symbol of KWESW. Effective May 1, 2023, the warrants issued in Canada are listed on the\nTSX-V under the stock symbol of KWE.WT.U.\nb) Reverse Stock Split\nIn August 2022, we submitted a Form F-1 Registration Statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and applied to have its common shares listed on Nasdaq. In connection with KWESST’s listing\napplication on Nasdaq, we effected a one for seventy (1-for-70) reverse stock split of its common stock on\nOctober 28, 2022 (the “Reverse Split”). Accordingly, all shareholders of record at the opening of business on\nOctober 28, 2022, received one issued and outstanding common share of KWESST in exchange for seventy\noutstanding common shares of KWESST. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Split.\nAll fractional shares created by the Reverse Split were rounded to the nearest whole number of common shares,\nwith any fractional interest representing 0.5 or more common shares entitling holders thereof to receive one\nwhole common share.\nEffective on the date of the Reverse Split, the exercise price and number of common shares issuable upon the\nexercise of outstanding stock options were proportionately adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split. The restricted\nshare units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) have also been adjusted for the Reverse Split. While\nthe number of warrants has not changed as a result of the Reverse Split; the conversion rate for each warrant was\nadjusted from one common share to 0.01428571 common share. All information respecting outstanding common\nshares and other securities of KWESST, including net loss per share, in the current and comparative periods\npresented herein give effect to the Reverse Split.\n2. Basis of preparation\n(a) Going concern\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming we will\ncontinue as a going concern.\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have\nincurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded\nfrom financing activities. We have incurred a $5.1 million net loss and negative operating cash flows of $6.9\nmillion for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 (2023 - $6.9 million net loss and negative operating cash flows\nof $11.3 million). At June 30, 2024, we had $0.3 million in working capital (September 30, 2023 – $0.5 million)\nand $40.3 million in deficit (September 30, 2023 – $35.2 million).\n7\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course\nof business is dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products,\nand the ability to raise additional debt or equity financing, when required. There are various risks and\nuncertainties affecting our future financial position and our performance including, but not limited to:\n• The market acceptance and rate of commercialization of our product offerings;\n• Ability to successfully execute our business plan;\n• Ability to raise additional capital at acceptable terms; and\n• General local and global economic conditions, including the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the global\ndisruption from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nOur strategy to mitigate these material risks and uncertainties is to execute timely a business plan aimed at\ncontinued focus on revenue growth, product development and innovation, improving overall gross profit,\nmanaging operating expenses and working capital requirements, and securing additional capital, as needed.\nFailure to implement our business plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or\nfinancial performance. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required\nin the future. Accordingly, there are material risks and uncertainties that may cast substantial doubt about our\nability to continue as a going concern.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the\ncarrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities and reported expenses that may otherwise be required if\nthe going concern basis was not appropriate.\n(b) Statement of compliance\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nIAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board\n(“IASB”) and the interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee. They do not include all the information\nrequired for a complete set of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting\nStandards (“IFRS”) and should be read in conjunction with our annual consolidated financial statements for the\nyear ended September 30, 2023. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and\ntransactions that are material to an understanding of the changes in our financial position and performance since\nthe last annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of\nDirectors on August 14, 2024.\n(c) Basis of consolidation\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements incorporate the financial statements of\nKWESST and the entities it controls.\nControl is achieved where we have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to\nobtain benefits from its activities, are exposed to, or have rights to, variable returns from our involvement with\nthe entity and have the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully\nconsolidated from the date on which control is transferred to us until the date on which control ceases. Profit or\nloss of subsidiaries acquired during the year are recognized from the date of acquisition or effective date of\ndisposal as applicable. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n8\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nAt June 30, 2024, we have the following wholly owned subsidiaries:\nLocation Equity %\nKWESST Inc.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value\nof the consideration given in exchange for assets.\n(f) Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS\nrequires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of accounting\npolicies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income, expenses, and disclosure of contingent\nliabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized\nprospectively.\nJudgments\nInformation about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most material effects on the\namounts recognized in these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the same as\ndisclosed in Note 2(f) of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nEstimates\nInformation about assumptions and estimation uncertainties at June 30, 2024, that have a material risk of resulting\nin a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are the same\nas disclosed in Note 2(f) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023.\n3.

As part of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, we have issued 3,226,392 warrants\n(the “2022 Warrants”) with an exercise price of US$5.00 per share. Additionally, the U.S. underwriter exercised\nits over-allotment option to purchase:\n• 199,000 Pre-Funded Warrants with an exercise price of US$0.01 per share for $3.81024 per pre-funded\nwarrant (net of underwriter discount);\n• 375,000 warrants with exercise price of US$5.00 per share for $0.0001 per warrant;\nRefer to Note 11(a) for further information on the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering.\nIn accordance with IFRS, the above securities are classified as financial liabilities (referred herein as “warrant\nliabilities”) because the exercise price is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is different to our functional\ncurrency (Canadian dollars). Accordingly, the ultimate proceeds in Canadian dollars from the potential exercise\nof the above securities are not known at inception. These financial liabilities are classified and measured at\nFVTPL (see Note 3(c) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023).\nGains on revaluation of the warrant liabilities are presented in Other income (expenses) on the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nWarrant liabilities\nWhile the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO were listed on Nasdaq and closed at US$0.90 per warrant on December\n9, 2022, management concluded that this closing price was not reflective of an active market due to short trading\nwindow and therefore not representative of fair value. Accordingly, at inception, the 2022 Warrants were\nmeasured at fair value using the Black Scholes option pricing model (Level 2). We used the following\nassumptions:\n12\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nOver-allotment\n2022 Pre-Funded Over-allotment\nWarrants Warrants (1) Warrants (2)\nNumber of dilutive securities 3,282,533 199,000 375,000\nExercise price (in USD) $ 5.00 $ 0.01\nShare price (in USD) $ 4.13 $ 3.08\nExpected life 2.50\nDividend $ -\nVolatility 75%\nRisk free rate 4.20%\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1.363\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 1.43 $ 4.18 $ 1.43\n(1) Fair value is measured at the underlying common share closing price on Nasdaq on December 9, 2022, less US$0.01 exercise price.\n(2) Same fair value as calculated for Warrants.\nThe share price (in USD) for the over-allotment pre-funded warrants was based on the estimated fair value of\nthe common shares issued on December 9, 2022, by deducting the fair value of the warrants of US$1.05 from\nthe US$4.13 Unit price and the exercise price of US$0.01 (see Note 11(a)).\nBased on the above fair value, the issuance of the over-allotment pre-funded warrants and warrants to the\nunderwriter resulted in a non-cash charge of $251,877, which is included in the change in fair value of warrant\nliabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss for the\nthree months ended December 31, 2022.\nAt June 30,2024, the fair value of the warrants was remeasured using the following assumptions:\nOver-allotment\n2022 Warrants Pre-Funded Over-allotment\n(1) Warrants Warrants (1)\nNumber of securities 3,282,533 - 375,000\nNasdaq closing price (in USD) $ 0.03 $ - $ 0.03\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1.3687 $ - $ -\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 0.04 $ - $ 0.04\n(1) Fair value is based on the Nasdaq closing pricing on June 28, 2024, for the warrants.\nWe recognized a gain of $678,172 and $1,325,820 in fair value of warrant liabilities during the three and nine\nmonths ended June 30,2024, respectively, which was reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated net loss\nand comprehensive loss.\nDecember 2022 Debt Settlement\nOn December 13, 2022, we had entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders (see Note 11(a)),\nwhich resulted in issuing 56,141 Units, same terms as the Units as issued in the Canadian Offering except that\nthe underlying securities are subject to a four-month hold period. Accordingly, this resulted in issuing 56,141\ncommon shares and 56,141 warrant liabilities with an exercise price of US$5.00 per share and maturing on\nDecember 13, 2027. We initially recorded the fair value of the warrant liabilities using the Black Scholes option\npricing model with an underlying stock price equivalent to the unit price of US$4.13.\n13\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nAt June 30 2024, we remeasured the fair value of these warrant liabilities using the Nasdaq closing price on June\n28, 2024, of US$0.0265. The remeasurement resulted in a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $7,092\nand $16,104 for the three and nine months ended June, 30, 2024, respectively, which was reported in the\nunaudited condensed consolidated net loss and comprehensive loss.\nPrivate Placement (July 2023)\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed an underwritten U.S. private placement for gross proceeds of CAD$7.4 million\n(US$5.59 million) (see Note 11(a)). As part of the private placement, we have issued 1,542,194 warrants (the\n“2023 Warrants”) with an exercise price of US$2.66 per share. Additionally, 930,548 pre-funded Warrants with\nan exercise price of US$0.001 per share for US$2.259 per pre-funded warrant were issued.\nRefer to Note 11(a) for further information on the private placement.\nUnder IFRS, the above securities are classified as financial liabilities (referred herein as “warrant liabilities”)\nbecause the exercise price is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is different to our functional currency (Canadian\ndollars). Accordingly, the ultimate proceeds in Canadian dollars from the potential exercise of the above\nsecurities are not known at inception. These financial liabilities are classified and measured at FVTPL (see Note\n3(c) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023).

In this offering, 803,500 pre-funded Warrants with an exercise price of US$0.001 per\nshare for US$0.649 per pre-funded warrant were issued.\nRefer to Note 11(a) for further information on the offering.\nUnder IFRS, the above securities are classified as financial liabilities (referred herein as “warrant liabilities”)\nbecause the exercise price is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is different to our functional currency (Canadian\ndollars).

In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2.5 million\nunits at a public offering price of USD $4.13 per unit (the “Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and\none warrant to purchase one share of common stock (“Warrant”). The Warrants have a per share exercise price\nof USD $5.00 and can be exercised immediately. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter\npartially exercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share\npurchase warrants (“Pre-Funded Warrants”) at US$4.12 (before underwriter discount) and 375,000 option\nwarrants to purchase common shares at US$0.0001 each. A Pre-Funded Warrant is a financial instrument that\nrequires the holder to pay little consideration (exercise price of US$0.01) to receive the common share upon\nexercise of the Pre-Funded Warrant. The holder of Pre-Funded Warrants has no voting rights. All these warrants\nexpire on December 9, 2027.\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one common share and one warrant to\npurchase one common share, at a price to the public of USD $4.13 per unit.

This total was allocated\nproportionately to the fair value of common shares and warrant liabilities. Accordingly, CAD$1.3 million\nallocated to warrant liabilities was reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated net loss and comprehensive\nloss.\nDebt Settlement (December 2022)\nWe have entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders, which closed on December 13, 2022,\nfollowing TSXV’s conditional approval.

Corporate information\na) Corporate information\nKWESST Micro Systems Inc. (the “Company”, “KWESST”, “we”, “our”, and “us”) was incorporated on\nNovember 28, 2017, under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. Our registered office is located at 550\nBurrard Street, Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and our corporate office is located at Unit 1,\n155 Terrence Matthews Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We have representative offices in the following\nforeign locations: Washington DC (United States), London (United Kingdom), and Abu Dhabi (United Arab\nEmirates).\nWe develop and commercialize next-generation technology solutions that deliver a tactical advantage for\nmilitary, public safety agencies and personal defense markets. Our core mission is to protect and save lives.\nKWESST’s common stock is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (“TSX-V’’) under the stock symbol of KWE,\non the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the stock symbol of KWE and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange\nunder the stock symbol of 62U. Additionally, warrants issued in the United States are also listed on the Nasdaq\nunder the stock symbol of KWESW. Effective May 1, 2023, the warrants issued in Canada are listed on the\nTSX-V under the stock symbol of KWE.WT.U.\nb) Reverse Stock Split\nIn August 2022, we submitted a Form F-1 Registration Statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and applied to have its common shares listed on Nasdaq. In connection with KWESST’s listing\napplication on Nasdaq, we effected a one for seventy (1-for-70) reverse stock split of its common stock on\nOctober 28, 2022 (the “Reverse Split”). Accordingly, all shareholders of record at the opening of business on\nOctober 28, 2022, received one issued and outstanding common share of KWESST in exchange for seventy\noutstanding common shares of KWESST. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Split.\nAll fractional shares created by the Reverse Split were rounded to the nearest whole number of common shares,\nwith any fractional interest representing 0.5 or more common shares entitling holders thereof to receive one\nwhole common share.\nEffective on the date of the Reverse Split, the exercise price and number of common shares issuable upon the\nexercise of outstanding stock options were proportionately adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split. The restricted\nshare units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) have also been adjusted for the Reverse Split. While\nthe number of warrants has not changed as a result of the Reverse Split; the conversion rate for each warrant was\nadjusted from one common share to 0.01428571 common share. All information respecting outstanding common\nshares and other securities of KWESST, including net loss per share, in the current and comparative periods\npresented herein give effect to the Reverse Split.\n2. Basis of preparation\n(a) Going concern\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming we will\ncontinue as a going concern.\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have\nincurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded\nfrom financing activities. We have incurred a $3.9 million net loss and negative operating cash flows of $5.0\nmillion for the six months ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $3.4 million net loss and negative operating cash flows\nof $9.2 million). At March 31, 2024, we had negative $2.2 million in working capital (September 30, 2023 –\n$0.5 million).\n7\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course\nof business is dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products,\nand the ability to raise additional debt or equity financing, when required. There are various risks and\nuncertainties affecting our future financial position and our performance including, but not limited to:\n• The market acceptance and rate of commercialization of our product offerings;\n• Ability to successfully execute our business plan;\n• Ability to raise additional capital at acceptable terms;\n• General local and global economic conditions, including the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the global\ndisruption from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nOur strategy to mitigate these material risks and uncertainties is to execute timely a business plan aimed at\ncontinued focus on revenue growth, product development and innovation, improving overall gross profit,\nmanaging operating expenses and working capital requirements, and securing additional capital, as needed.\nFailure to implement our business plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or\nfinancial performance. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required\nin the future. Accordingly, there are material risks and uncertainties that may cast substantial doubt about our\nability to continue as a going concern.\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying\namounts and classification of assets, liabilities and reported expenses that may otherwise be required if the going\nconcern basis was not appropriate.\n(b) Statement of compliance\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nIAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board\n(“IASB”). They do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared\nin accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and should be read in conjunction with\nour annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023. However, selected\nexplanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the\nchanges in our financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at\nand for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of\nDirectors on May 14, 2024.\n(c) Basis of consolidation\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements incorporate the financial statements of\nKWESST and the entities it controls.\nControl is achieved where we have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to\nobtain benefits from its activities, are exposed to, or have rights to, variable returns from our involvement with\nthe entity and have the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully\nconsolidated from the date on which control is transferred to us until the date on which control ceases. Profit or\nloss of subsidiaries acquired during the year are recognized from the date of acquisition or effective date of\ndisposal as applicable. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n8\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nAt March 31, 2024, we have the following wholly owned subsidiaries:\nLocation Equity %\nKWESST Inc.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given\nin exchange for assets.\n(f) Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS\nrequires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of accounting\npolicies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income, expenses, and disclosure of contingent\nliabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized\nprospectively.\nJudgments\nInformation about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the\namounts recognized in these consolidated financial statements are the same as disclosed in Note 2(f) of the\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nEstimates\nInformation about assumptions and estimation uncertainties at March 31, 2024, that have a significant risk of\nresulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are\nthe same as disclosed in Note 2(f) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September\n30, 2023.\n3. Significant accounting policies\nDuring the six months ended March 31, 2024, the accounting policies in these condensed consolidated interim\nfinancial statements are the same as those applied in KWESST’s consolidated financial statements as at and for\nthe year ended September 30, 2023.\n9\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\n4.

Accordingly, the ultimate proceeds in Canadian dollars from the potential exercise of the above\nsecurities are not known at inception. These financial liabilities are classified and measured at FVTPL (see Note\n3(c) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023). Gains on\nrevaluation of the warrant liabilities are presented in Other income (expenses) on the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nWarrant liabilities\nWhile the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO were listed on Nasdaq and closed at US$0.90 per warrant on December\n9, 2022, management concluded that this closing price was not reflective of an active market due to short trading\nwindow and therefore not representative of fair value. Accordingly, at inception, the 2022 Warrants were\nmeasured at fair value using the Black Scholes option pricing model (Level 2). We used the following\nassumptions:\nOver-allotment\n2022 Pre-Funded Over-allotment\nWarrants Warrants (1) Warrants (2)\nNumber of dilutive securities 3,282,533 199,000 375,000\nExercise price (in USD) $ 5.00 $ 0.01\nShare price (in USD) $ 4.13 $ 3.08\nExpected life 2.50\nDividend $ -\nVolatility 75%\nRisk free rate 4.20%\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1.363\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 1.43 $ 4.18 $ 1.43\n(1) Fair value is measured at the underlying common share closing price on Nasdaq on December 9, 2022, less US$0.01 exercise price.\n(2) Same fair value as calculated for Warrants.\nThe share price (in USD) for the over-allotment pre-funded warrants was based on the estimated fair value of\nthe common shares issued on December 9, 2022, by deducting the fair value of the warrants of US$1.05 from\nthe US$4.13 Unit price and the exercise price of US$0.01 (see Note 11(a)).\nBased on the above fair value, the issuance of the over-allotment pre-funded warrants and warrants to the\nunderwriter resulted in a non-cash charge of $251,877, which is included in the change in fair value of warrant\nliabilities in the condensed consolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nAt March 31, 2024, we remeasured the fair value of these warrants using the following assumptions:\n12\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nOver-allotment\n2022 Warrants Pre-Funded Over-allotment\n(1) Warrants (2) Warrants (1)\nNumber of securities 3,282,533 199,000 375,000\nNasdaq closing price (in USD) $ 0.12 $ 1.24 $ 0.12\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1.355 $ 1.355 $ 1.355\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 0.16 $ 1.67 $ 0.16\n(1) Fair value is based on the Nasdaq closing pricing on March 28, 2024, for the warrants.\n(2) Fair value is measured at the Nasdaq closing price on March 28, 2024, for the underlying common stock less US$0.01 exercise price.\nWe recognized a loss of $1,044 and a gain of $647,648 in fair value of warrant liabilities during the three and\nsix months ended March 31, 2024, respectively, which was reported in the condensed consolidated net loss and\ncomprehensive loss.\nDecember 2022 Debt Settlement\nOn December 13, 2022, we have entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders (see Note 11(a)),\nwhich resulted in issuing 56,141 Units, same terms as the Units as issued in the Canadian Offering except that\nthe underlying securities are subject to a four-month hold period. Accordingly, this resulted in issuing 56,141\ncommon shares and 56,141 warrant liabilities with an exercise price of US$5.00 per share and maturing on\nDecember 13, 2027. We initially recorded the fair value of the warrant liabilities using the Black Scholes option\npricing model with an underlying stock price equivalent to the unit price of US$4.13.\nAt March 31, 2024, we remeasured the fair value of these warrant liabilities using the Nasdaq closing price on\nMarch 28, 2024, of US$0.12. The remeasurement resulted in a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $1,252\nand $9,012 for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, respectively, which was reported in the condensed\nconsolidated net loss and comprehensive loss.\nPrivate Placement\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed an underwritten U.S. private placement for gross proceeds of CAD$7.4 million\n(US$5.59 million) (see Note 11(a)). As part of the private placement, we have issued 1,542,194 warrants (the\n“2023 Warrants”) with an exercise price of US$2.66 per share. Additionally, 930,548 pre-funded Warrants with\nan exercise price of US$0.001 per share for US$2.259 per pre-funded warrant were issued.\nRefer to Note 11(a) for further information on the private placement.\nUnder IFRS, the above securities are classified as financial liabilities (referred herein as “warrant liabilities”)\nbecause the exercise price is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is different to our functional currency (Canadian\ndollars).

Accordingly, at inception, the 2023 Warrants were measured at fair value using the Black\nScholes option pricing model (Level 2).

In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2.5 million\nunits at a public offering price of USD $4.13 per unit (the “Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and\none warrant to purchase one share of common stock (“Warrant”). The Warrants have a per share exercise price\nof USD $5.00 and can be exercised immediately. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter\npartially exercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share\npurchase warrants (“Pre-Funded Warrants”) at US$4.12 (before underwriter discount) and 375,000 option\nwarrants to purchase common shares at US$0.0001 each. A Pre-Funded Warrant is a financial instrument that\nrequires the holder to pay little consideration (exercise price of US$0.01) to receive the common share upon\nexercise of the Pre-Funded Warrant. The holder of Pre-Funded Warrants has no voting rights. All these warrants\nexpire on December 9, 2027.\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one common share and one warrant to\npurchase one common share, at a price to the public of USD $4.13 per unit. The warrants will have a per common\nshare exercise price of USD $5.00, are exercisable immediately and expire in five years on December 9, 2027.\nEffective May 1, 2023, the warrants are listed on the TSX-V under the stock symbol of KWE.WT.U.\nThe closing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of CAD$19.4 million\n(USD $14.1 million), before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.\nThe common shares of KWESST and the Warrants sold in the U.S. IPO began trading on the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket under the symbols “KWE” and “KWESW”, respectively, on December 7, 2022.\nThinkEquity acted as sole book-running manager for the U.S. IPO and PI Financial acted as sole book-running\nmanager for the Canadian Offering.\nAccounting Treatment\nRefer to Note 10 for the accounting of the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering.\nBrokers’ Compensation and Share Offering Costs\nAs consideration for the services provided in connection with the U.S. IPO, ThinkEquity received: (a) a broker-\ndealer cash commission of US$835,000 (or CAD$1,138,105) equal to 7.5% of the gross offering proceeds of the\nU.S. Offering and (b) underwriter warrants (the “U.S. Underwriter Warrants”) to purchase up to 134,950\ncommon shares equal to 5% of the common shares and pre-funded common share purchase warrants issued under\nthe U.S. Offering. Each U.S. Underwriter Warrant is exercisable to acquire one common share at a price of\nUS$5.1625, exercisable as of June 4, 2023, and expiring on December 9, 2027.\nAs consideration for the services provided in connection with the Canadian Offering, PI Financial received: (a)\na cash commission of approximately US$210,000 (or CAD$286,230); and (b) 50,848 compensation options (the\n15\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\n“Canadian Compensation Options”). Each Canadian Compensation Option is exercisable to acquire one\nCanadian Unit at a price of US$4.13 and expiring on December 9, 2024.\nIn addition to the above brokers’ compensation, we also incurred US$2.1 million share offering costs (or\nCAD$2.8 million) for the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, of which CAD$628,262 was incurred and deferred\nat September 30, 2022.\nThe total brokers compensation (including fair value of U.S. Underwriter Warrants and Canadian Compensation\nOptions) and share offering costs was US$3.2 million (or CAD$4.4 million). This total was allocated\nproportionately to the fair value of common shares and warrant liabilities. Accordingly, CAD$1.3 million\nallocated to warrant liabilities was reported in the condensed consolidated net loss and comprehensive loss.\nShares for Debt Settlement\nWe have entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders, which closed on December 13, 2022,\nfollowing TSXV’s conditional approval. This resulted in issuing 56,141 Units to settle $12,000 of the March\n2022 Loans and USD$223,321 (or CAD$302,197) of the August 2022 Loans, including unpaid accrued interest\nand 10% premium at maturity (the “Debt Settlements”). The terms of the Units are the same as the Units issued\nin the Canadian Offering.\nOn January 10, 2024, we issued 46,709 common shares in a settlement of debt in an amount of approximately\n$97,615. The debt resulted in a trail obligation relating to services rendered by a third-party consultant, which\nthe Company has elected to pay in common shares. The common shares issued pursuant to the Debt Settlement\n(signed October 31, 2023) are subject to a four-month hold period pursuant to applicable securities legislation\nand the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange.\nPrivate Placement\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed a brokered private placement, resulting in the issuance of 1,542,194 common shares\nof KWESST, for aggregate gross proceeds of USD$5,588,397 (approximately CAD$7.4M) (the “July 2023\nOffering”).\nAs a part of the July 2023 Offering, the Company issued 1,542,194 common shares at a price of US$2.26\n(CAD$2.98) per common share (each a \"Common Share\") and 930,548 pre-funded warrants at a price of\nUS$2.259 (CAD$2.979) per pre-funded warrant (each a \"Pre-funded Warrant\"), with each Common Share and\nPre-funded Warrant being bundled with one common share purchase warrant of the Company (each a \"Common\nWarrant\"). Each Pre-Funded Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one Common Share at an exercise price of\nUS$0.001 per Common Share, and each Common Warrant is immediately exercisable and entitles the holder to\nacquire one Common Share at an exercise price of US$2.66 (CAD$3.50) per Common Share for a period of 60\nmonths following the closing of the July 2023 Offering. Although the Common Shares and Pre-funded Warrants\nare each bundled with a Common Warrant, each security is issued separately.\nBrokers’ Compensation and Share Offering Costs\nThinkEquity acted as sole placement agent for the Offering. As compensation for services rendered, the\nCompany paid to ThinkEquity a cash fee of $475,013.14 representing 8.5% of the aggregate gross proceeds of\nthe Offering and issued 123,637 warrants to purchase a number of Common Shares (the \"Placement Agent\nWarrants\"), representing 5% of the Common Shares and Pre-Funded Warrants sold in the Offering. The\nPlacement Agent Warrants will be exercisable, in whole or in part, immediately upon issuance and will expire\n60 months after the closing date of the Offering at an initial exercise price of US$2.66 (CAD$3.50) per Common\nShare.\n16\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nb) Warrants\nThe following is a summary of changes in outstanding warrants since September 30, 2023:\nWeighted\nNumber of average\nwarrants exercise price\nOutstanding at September 30, 2023 15,507,862 $ 2 .49\nExercised (385,716) -\nExpired (5,520,000) (0.12)\nOutstanding at March 31, 2024 9,602,146 $ 2 .37\nExercisable at March 31, 2024 8,672,008 $ 2 .50\nThe table below outlines the ratio upon which the above warrants are converted into common shares.\nU.S. Underwriter Warrants\nIn the U.S. IPO, we issued 134,950 warrants (“U.S. Underwriter Warrants”).

Corporate information\na) Corporate information\nKWESST Micro Systems Inc. (the “Company”, “KWESST”, “we”, “our”, and “us”) was incorporated on\nNovember 28, 2017, under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. Our registered office is located at 550\nBurrard Street, Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and our corporate office is located at Unit 1,\n155 Terrence Matthews Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We have representative offices in the following\nforeign locations: Washington DC (United States), London (United Kingdom), and Abu Dhabi (United Arab\nEmirates).\nWe develop and commercialize next-generation technology solutions that deliver a tactical advantage for\nmilitary, public safety agencies and personal defense markets. Our core mission is to protect and save lives.\nKWESST’s common stock is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (“TSX-V’’) under the stock symbol of KWE,\non the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the stock symbol of KWE and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange\nunder the stock symbol of 62U. Additionally, warrants issued in the United States are also listed on the Nasdaq\nunder the stock symbol of KWESW. Effective May 1, 2023, the warrants issued in Canada are listed on the TSX-\nV under the stock symbol of KWE.WT.U.\nb) Reverse Stock Split\nIn August 2022, we submitted a Form F-1 Registration Statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and applied to have its common shares listed on Nasdaq. In connection with KWESST’s listing\napplication on Nasdaq, we effected a one for seventy (1-for-70) reverse stock split of its common stock on\nOctober 28, 2022 (the “Reverse Split”). Accordingly, all shareholders of record at the opening of business on\nOctober 28, 2022, received one issued and outstanding common share of KWESST in exchange for seventy\noutstanding common shares of KWESST. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Split.\nAll fractional shares created by the Reverse Split were rounded to the nearest whole number of common shares,\nwith any fractional interest representing 0.5 or more common shares entitling holders thereof to receive one\nwhole common share.\nEffective on the date of the Reverse Split, the exercise price and number of common shares issuable upon the\nexercise of outstanding stock options were proportionately adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split. The restricted\nshare units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) have also been adjusted for the Reverse Split. While\nthe number of warrants has not changed as a result of the Reverse Split; the conversion rate for each warrant was\nadjusted from one common share to 0.01428571 common share. All information respecting outstanding common\nshares and other securities of KWESST, including net loss per share, in the current and comparative periods\npresented herein give effect to the Reverse Split.\n2. Basis of preparation\n(a) Going concern\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming we will\ncontinue as a going concern.\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have\nincurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded\nfrom financing activities. We have incurred a $0.4 million net loss and negative operating cash flows of $2.9\nmillion for the three months ended December 31, 2023 (2022 - $2.2 million net loss and negative operating cash\nflows of $6.6 million). At December 31, 2023, we had $0.4 million in working capital (December 31, 2022 –\n$3.0 million).\n7\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course\nof business is dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products,\nand the ability to raise additional debt or equity financing, when required. There are various risks and\nuncertainties affecting our future financial position and our performance including, but not limited to:\n• The market acceptance and rate of commercialization of our product offerings;\n• Ability to successfully execute our business plan;\n• Ability to raise additional capital at acceptable terms;\n• General local and global economic conditions, including the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the global\ndisruption from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nOur strategy to mitigate these material risks and uncertainties is to execute timely a business plan aimed at\ncontinued focus on revenue growth, product development and innovation, improving overall gross profit,\nmanaging operating expenses and working capital requirements, and securing additional capital, as needed.\nFailure to implement our business plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or\nfinancial performance. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required\nin the future. Accordingly, there are material risks and uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about our\nability to continue as a going concern.\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying\namounts and classification of assets, liabilities and reported expenses that may otherwise be required if the going\nconcern basis was not appropriate.\n(b) Statement of compliance\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nIAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board\n(“IASB”). They do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared\nin accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and should be read in conjunction with\nour annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023. However, selected\nexplanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the\nchanges in our financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at\nand for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of\nDirectors on February 14, 2024.\n(c) Basis of consolidation\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements incorporate the financial statements of\nKWESST and the entities it controls.\nControl is achieved where we have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to\nobtain benefits from its activities, are exposed to, or have rights to, variable returns from our involvement with\nthe entity and have the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully\nconsolidated from the date on which control is transferred to us until the date on which control ceases. Profit or\nloss of subsidiaries acquired during the year are recognized from the date of acquisition or effective date of\ndisposal as applicable. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n8\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nAt December 31, 2023, we have the following wholly owned subsidiaries:\nLocation Equity %\nKWESST Inc.

As part of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, we have issued 3,226,392 warrants (the\n“2022 Warrants”) with an exercise price of US$5.00 per share. Additionally, the U.S. underwriter exercised its\nover-allotment option to purchase:\n• 199,000 Pre-Funded Warrants with an exercise price of US$0.01 per share for $3.81024 per pre-funded\nwarrant (net of underwriter discount);\n• 375,000 warrants with exercise price of US$5.00 per share for $0.0001 per warrant;\nRefer to Note 11(a) for further information on the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering.\nUnder IFRS, the above securities are classified as financial liabilities (referred herein as “warrant liabilities”)\nbecause the exercise price is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is different to our functional currency (Canadian\ndollars). Accordingly, the ultimate proceeds in Canadian dollars from the potential exercise of the above\nsecurities are not known at inception. These financial liabilities are classified and measured at FVTPL (see Note\n3(c) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023). Gains on\nrevaluation of the warrant liabilities are presented in Other income (expenses) on the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nWarrant liabilities\nWhile the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO were listed on Nasdaq and closed at US$0.90 per warrant on December\n9, 2022, management concluded that this closing price was not reflective of an active market due to short trading\nwindow and therefore not representative of fair value. Accordingly, at inception, the 2022 Warrants were\nmeasured at fair value using the Black Scholes option pricing model (Level 2). We used the following\nassumptions:\nOver-allotment\n2022 Pre-Funded Over-allotment\nWarrants Warrants (1) Warrants (2)\nNumber of dilutive securities 3,282,533 199,000 375,000\nExercise price (in USD) $ 5.00 $ 0.01\nShare price (in USD) $ 4.13 $ 3.08\nExpected life 2.50\nDividend $ -\nVolatility 75%\nRisk free rate 4.20%\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1.363\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 1.43 $ 4.18 $ 1.43\n(1) Fair value is measured at the underlying common share closing price on Nasdaq on December 9, 2022, less US$0.01 exercise price.\n(2) Same fair value as calculated for Warrants.\nThe share price (in USD) for the over-allotment pre-funded warrants was based on the estimated fair value of\nthe common shares issued on December 9, 2022, by deducting the fair value of the warrants of US$1.05 from\nthe US$4.13 Unit price and the exercise price of US$0.01 (see Note 11(a)).\n12\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nBased on the above fair value, the issuance of the over-allotment pre-funded warrants and warrants to the\nunderwriter resulted in a non-cash charge of $251,877, which is included in the change in fair value of warrant\nliabilities in the condensed consolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nAt December 31, 2023, we remeasured the fair value of these warrants using the following assumptions:\nOver-allotment\n2022 Pre-Funded Over-allotment\nWarrants (1) Warrants (2) Warrants (1)\nNumber of securities 3,282,533 199,000 375,000\nNasdaq closing price (in USD) $ 0.14 $ 0.89 $ 0.14\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1.323 $ 1.323 $ 1.323\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 0.18 $ 1.16 $ 0.18\n(1) Fair value is based on the Nasdaq closing pricing on December 31, 2023, for the warrants.\n(2) Fair value is measured at the Nasdaq closing price on December 31, 2023, for the underlying common stock less US$0.01 exercise price.\nWe recognized $648,692 as a gain in fair value of warrant liabilities during the three months ended December\n31, 2023, which was reported in the condensed consolidated net loss and comprehensive loss.\nDecember 2022 Debt Settlement\nOn December 13, 2022, we have entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders (see Note 11(a)),\nwhich resulted in issuing 56,141 Units, same terms as the Units as issued in the Canadian Offering except that\nthe underlying securities are subject to a four-month hold period. Accordingly, this resulted in issuing 56,141\ncommon shares and 56,141 warrant liabilities with an exercise price of US$5.00 per share and maturing on\nDecember 13, 2027. We initially recorded the fair value of the warrant liabilities using the Black Scholes option\npricing model with an underlying stock price equivalent to the unit price of US$4.13.\nAt December 31, 2023, we remeasured the fair value of these warrant liabilities using the Nasdaq closing price\non December 29, 2023, of US$0.14. The remeasurement resulted in a change in fair value of warrant liabilities\nof $4,726 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, which was reported in the condensed consolidated net\nloss and comprehensive loss.\nPrivate Placement\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed an underwritten U.S. private placement for gross proceeds of CAD$7.4 million\n(US$5.59 million) (see Note 11(a)). As part of the private placement, we have issued 1,542,194 warrants (the\n“2023 Warrants”) with an exercise price of US$2.66 per share. Additionally, 930,548 pre-funded Warrants with\nan exercise price of US$0.001 per share for US$2.259 per pre-funded warrant were issued.\nRefer to Note 11(a) for further information on the private placement.\nUnder IFRS, the above securities are classified as financial liabilities (referred herein as “warrant liabilities”)\nbecause the exercise price is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is different to our functional currency (Canadian\ndollars).

In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2.5 million\nunits at a public offering price of USD $4.13 per unit (the “Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and\none warrant to purchase one share of common stock (“Warrant”). The Warrants have a per share exercise price\nof USD $5.00 and can be exercised immediately. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter\npartially exercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share\npurchase warrants (“Pre-Funded Warrants”) at US$4.12 (before underwriter discount) and 375,000 option\nwarrants to purchase common shares at US$0.0001 each. A Pre-Funded Warrant is a financial instrument that\nrequires the holder to pay little consideration (exercise price of US$0.01) to receive the common share upon\nexercise of the Pre-Funded Warrant. The holder of Pre-Funded Warrants has no voting rights. All these warrants\nexpire on December 9, 2027.\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one common share and one warrant to\npurchase one common share, at a price to the public of USD $4.13 per unit. The warrants will have a per common\nshare exercise price of USD $5.00, are exercisable immediately and expire in five years on December 9, 2027.\nEffective May 1, 2023, the warrants are listed on the TSX-V under the stock symbol of KWE.WT.U.\nThe closing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of CAD$19.4 million\n(USD $14.1 million), before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.\nThe common shares of KWESST and the Warrants sold in the U.S. IPO began trading on the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket under the symbols “KWE” and “KWESW”, respectively, on December 7, 2022.\nThinkEquity acted as sole book-running manager for the U.S. IPO and PI Financial acted as sole book-running\nmanager for the Canadian Offering.\nAccounting Treatment\nRefer to Note 10 for the accounting of the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering.\nBrokers’ Compensation and Share Offering Costs\nAs consideration for the services provided in connection with the U.S. IPO, ThinkEquity received: (a) a broker-\ndealer cash commission of US$835,000 (or CAD$1,138,105) equal to 7.5% of the gross offering proceeds of the\nU.S. Offering and (b) underwriter warrants (the “U.S. Underwriter Warrants”) to purchase up to 134,950\ncommon shares equal to 5% of the common shares and pre-funded common share purchase warrants issued under\n15\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2023, and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nthe U.S. Offering.

Each Canadian Compensation Option is exercisable to acquire one\nCanadian Unit at a price of US$4.13 and expiring on December 9, 2024.\nIn addition to the above brokers’ compensation, we also incurred US$2.1 million share offering costs (or\nCAD$2.8 million) for the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, of which CAD$628,262 was incurred and deferred\nat September 30, 2022.\nThe total brokers compensation (including fair value of U.S. Underwriter Warrants and Canadian Compensation\nOptions) and share offering costs was US$3.2 million (or CAD$4.4 million). This total was allocated\nproportionately to the fair value of common shares and warrant liabilities. Accordingly, CAD$1.3 million\nallocated to warrant liabilities were expensed during the nine months ended June 30, 2023.\nShares for Debt Settlement\nWe have entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders, which closed on December 13, 2022,\nfollowing TSXV’s conditional approval. This resulted in issuing 56,141 Units to settle $12,000 of the March\n2022 Loans and USD$223,321 (or CAD$302,197) of the August 2022 Loans, including unpaid accrued interest\nand 10% premium at maturity (the “Debt Settlements”). The terms of the Units are the same as the Units issued\nin the Canadian Offering.\nPrivate Placement\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed a brokered private placement, resulting in the issuance of 1,542,194 common shares\nof KWESST, for aggregate gross proceeds of USD$5,588,397 (approximately CAD$7.4M) (the “July 2023\nOffering”).\nAs a part of the July 2023 Offering, the Company issued 1,542,194 common shares at a price of US$2.26\n(CAD$2.98) per common share (each a \"Common Share\") and 930,548 pre-funded warrants at a price of\nUS$2.259 (CAD$2.979) per pre-funded warrant (each a \"Pre-funded Warrant\"), with each Common Share and\nPre-funded Warrant being bundled with one common share purchase warrant of the Company (each a \"Common\nWarrant\"). Each Pre-Funded Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one Common Share at an exercise price of\nUS$0.001 per Common Share, and each Common Warrant is immediately exercisable and entitles the holder to\nacquire one Common Share at an exercise price of US$2.66 (CAD$3.50) per Common Share for a period of 60\nmonths following the closing of the July 2023 Offering. Although the Common Shares and Pre-funded Warrants\nare each bundled with a Common Warrant, each security is issued separately.\nBrokers’ Compensation and Share Offering Costs\nThinkEquity acted as sole placement agent for the Offering.

Corporate information\na) Corporate information\nKWESST Micro Systems Inc. (the “Company”, “KWESST”, “we”, “our”, and “us”) was incorporated on\nNovember 28, 2017, under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. Our registered office is located at 550\nBurrard Street, Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and our corporate office is located at Unit 1,\n155 Terrence Matthews Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We have representative offices in the following\nforeign locations: Washington DC (United States), London (United Kingdom), and Abu Dhabi (United Arab\nEmirates).\nWe develop and commercialize next-generation technology solutions that deliver a tactical advantage for\nmilitary, public safety agencies and personal defense markets. Our core mission is to protect and save lives.\nKWESST’s common stock is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (“TSX-V’’) under the stock symbol of KWE,\non the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the stock symbol of KWE and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange\nunder the stock symbol of 62U. Additionally, warrants issued in the United States are also listed on the Nasdaq\nunder the stock symbol of KWESW.\nb) Reverse Stock Split\nIn August 2022, we submitted a Form F-1 Registration Statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and applied to have its common shares listed on Nasdaq. In connection with KWESST’s listing\napplication on Nasdaq, we effected a one for seventy (1-for-70) reverse stock split of its common stock on\nOctober 28, 2022 (the “Reverse Split”). Accordingly, all shareholders of record at the opening of business on\nOctober 28, 2022, received one issued and outstanding common share of KWESST in exchange for seventy\noutstanding common shares of KWESST. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Split.\nAll fractional shares created by the Reverse Split were rounded to the nearest whole number of common shares,\nwith any fractional interest representing 0.5 or more common shares entitling holders thereof to receive one\nwhole common share.\nEffective on the date of the Reverse Split, the exercise price and number of common shares issuable upon the\nexercise of outstanding stock options were proportionately adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split. The restricted\nshare units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) have also been adjusted for the Reverse Split. While\nthe number of warrants has not changed as a result of the Reverse Split; the conversion rate for each warrant was\nadjusted from one common share to 0.01428571 common share. All information respecting outstanding common\nshares and other securities of KWESST, including net loss per share, in the current and comparative periods\npresented herein give effect to the Reverse Split.\n2. Basis of preparation\n(a) Going concern\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming we will\ncontinue as a going concern.\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have\nincurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded\nfrom financing activities. We have incurred a $2.2 million net loss and negative operating cash flows of $6.6\nmillion for the three months ended December 31, 2022 (2021 - $3.2 million net loss and negative operating cash\nflows of $1.9 million). At December 31, 2022, we had $3.0 million in working capital (2021 – negative $5.4\nmillion).\n7\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course\nof business is dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products,\nand the ability to raise additional debt or equity financing, when required. There are various risks and\nuncertainties affecting our future financial position and our performance including, but not limited to:\n• The market acceptance and rate of commercialization of our product offerings;\n• Ability to successfully execute our business plan;\n• Ability to raise additional capital at acceptable terms;\n• General local and global economic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the\nglobal disruption from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nOur strategy to mitigate these material risks and uncertainties is to execute timely a business plan aimed at\ncontinued focus on revenue growth, product development and innovation, improving overall gross profit,\nmanaging operating expenses and working capital requirements, and securing additional capital, as needed.\nFailure to implement our business plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or\nfinancial performance. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required\nin the future. Accordingly, there are material risks and uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about our\nability to continue as a going concern.\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying\namounts and classification of assets, liabilities and reported expenses that may otherwise be required if the going\nconcern basis was not appropriate.\n(b) Statement of compliance\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nIAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board\n(“IASB”). They do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared\nin accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and should be read in conjunction with\nour annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022. However, selected\nexplanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the\nchanges in our financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at\nand for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of\nDirectors on February 13, 2022.\n(c) Basis of consolidation\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements incorporate the financial statements of\nKWESST and the entities it controls.\nControl is achieved where we have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to\nobtain benefits from its activities, are exposed to, or have rights to, variable returns from our involvement with\nthe entity and have the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully\nconsolidated from the date on which control is transferred to us until the date on which control ceases. Profit or\nloss of subsidiaries acquired during the year are recognized from the date of acquisition or effective date of\ndisposal as applicable. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n8\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nAt December 31, 2022, we have the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:\n(d) Functional and presentation currency\nThese financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars (\"CAD\"), our functional currency and presentation\ncurrency.\n(e) Basis of measurement\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial\ninstruments measured at fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given\nin exchange for assets.\n(f) Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS\nrequires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of accounting\npolicies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income, expenses, and disclosure of contingent\nliabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized\nprospectively.\nJudgments\nInformation about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the\namounts recognized in these consolidated financial statements are the same as disclosed in Note 2(f) of the\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022, except for the following new item:\n• Note 12 – warrant liabilities: whether the determination of our stock volatility and the expected life of\nthe warrant liabilities are reasonable considering our limited operating history, both are significant\ninputs in the valuation model to fair value the warrant liabilities issued in the U.S IPO and Canadian\nOffering.\nEstimates\nInformation about assumptions and estimation uncertainties at December 31, 2022 that have a significant risk of\nresulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are\nthe same as disclosed in Note 2(f) of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30,\n2022.\n9\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nCOVID-19 Uncertainties\nThere is no change to our COVID-19 assessment from the disclosure provided in Note 2(f) of the consolidated\nfinancial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022.\n3. Significant accounting policies\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2022, the accounting policies in these condensed consolidated\ninterim financial statements are the same as those applied in KWESST’s consolidated financial statements as at\nand for the year ended September 30, 2022.\n4. Acquisition\nOn December 15, 2021, we acquired 2720178 Ontario Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation, which owns all of\nthe issued and outstanding shares of Police Ordnance Company Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation (together,\n“Police Ordnance”), herein referred as the “Police Ordnance Acquisition”. Located in Bowmanville, Ontario,\nwith ancillary operations in Florida, Police Ordnance owns all intellectual properties to the ARWENTM product\nline of launchers, and a proprietary line of 37 mm cartridges designed for riot control and tactical teams. Police\nOrdnance has law enforcement customers across Canada, the United States, and abroad. The Police Ordnance\nAcquisition provides us with a strategic opportunity to leverage its law enforcement customer base to accelerate\ngrowth within its specialty ordnance business.\nWe accounted for the acquisition of Police Ordinance pursuant to IFRS 3, Business Combinations.\nConsideration Transferred:\nThe purchase consideration comprised of the following:\nNumber Fair Value\nCommon shares 3,965 $ 377,503\nWarrants 200,000 $ 132,000\nContingent shares 875 $ 83,319\nTotal fair value purchase consideration $ 592,822\nThe warrants are exercisable at $1.72 each and will expire on December 15, 2024. As a result of the Reverse\nSplit (see Note 1(b)), each warrant converts into 0.01428571 common share or 70 warrants to receive one\ncommon share of KWESST.\nWe issued the 875 contingent common shares to the sellers in April 2022 following the fulfillment of the financial\nmilestone as defined in the share purchase agreement.\nWe have estimated the fair value as follows:\n• Common shares: based on KWESST’s closing stock price on December 15, 2021.\n• Warrants: based on using the Black Scholes option model with the following key inputs: a) exercise\nprice of $1.72, 1/70 of the underlying stock price of $1.36, risk free rate of 1.04%, expected life of three\nyears, and expected volatility of 84.7%.\n• Contingent shares: based on KWESST’s closing stock price on December 15, 2021, and high\nprobability of achieving the financial milestone as defined in the share purchase agreement.\n10\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nThe net cash inflow as at the closing of the acquisition was as follows:\nCash assumed on acquisition $ 162,547\nless: consideration paid in cash -\nNet cash inflow on acquisition $ 162,547\nNet Assets Acquired:\nThe purchase consideration was allocated to Police Ordnance’s net assets as follows:\nTotal purchase consideration at fair value $ 592,822\nPolice Ordnance's net assets:\nCash 162,547\nTrade and other receivables 104,432\nInventories 352,685\nIntangible assets:\nPurchase orders 100,000\nCustomer relationships 50,000\nARWENTM tradename 44,000\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 82,963\nCorporate tax liability 32,338\nContract liabilities 29,861\nBorrowings 26,238\nDeferred tax liabilities 49,442\nNet assets at fair value $ 592,822\nAs a result of the above purchase price allocation, we have recorded no goodwill for the Police Ordnance\nAcquisition.\nImpact on KWESST’s Results of Operations:\nThe results of operations of Police Ordnance are included in these consolidate statements of net loss and\ncomprehensive loss from December 16, 2021. For the quarter ended December 31, 2021, Police Ordnance had\nno contribution to revenue and did not contribute to our consolidated net loss.\nIf the acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2021, management estimates that Police Ordnance would have\ncontributed approximately $154,000 of revenue and approximately $11,800 of net loss to our operating results\nfor the three months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. In determining these amounts, we have assumed\nthat the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of the acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition\nhad occurred on October 1, 2021.\nWe incurred immaterial acquisition-related costs.\n11\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\n5.

As part of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, we have issued 3,226,392 warrants\nwith an exercise price of US$5.00 per share. Additionally, the U.S. underwriter exercised its over-allotment\noption to purchase:\n• 199,000 Pre-Funded Warrants with an exercise price of US$0.01 per share for $3.81024 per pre-funded\nwarrant (net of underwriter discount);\n• 375,000 warrants with exercise price of US$5.00 per share for $0.0001 per warrant;\nRefer to Note 13(a) for further information on the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering.\nUnder IFRS, the above securities are classified as financial liabilities (referred herein as “warrant liabilities”)\nbecause the exercise price is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is different to our functional currency (Canadian\ndollars). Accordingly, the ultimate proceeds in Canadian dollars from the potential exercise of the above\nsecurities are not known at inception. These financial liabilities are classified and measured at FVTPL (see Note\n3(c) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022). Losses (gains) on\nrevaluation of the warrant liabilities are presented in Other income (expenses) on the condensed consolidated\ninterim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\n14\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nWarrant liabilities\nWhile the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO were listed on Nasdaq and closed at US$0.90 per warrant on December\n9, 2022, management concluded that this closing price was not reflective of an active market due to short trading\nwindow and therefore not representative of fair value. Accordingly, the warrants were measured at fair value\nusing the Black Scholes option pricing model (Level 2). At initial recognition, we used the following\nassumptions:\nOver-allotment\nPre-Funded Over-allotment\nWarrants Warrants Warrants (1)\nNumber of dilutive securities 3 ,282,533 199,000 375,000\nExercise price (in USD) $ 5 .00 $ 0.01\nShare price (in USD) $ 4 .13 $ 3.08\nExpected life 2 .50 1.00\nDividend $ - $ -\nVolatility 75% 90%\nRisk free rate 4.20% 4.72%\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1 .363 $ 1.363\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 1 .05 $ 3.07 $ 1.05\n(1) Same fair value as calculated for Warrants in the above table.\nThe share price (in USD) for the over-allotment pre-funded warrants was based on the estimated fair value of\nthe common shares issued on December 9, 2022, by deducting the fair value of the warrants of $1.05 from the\nUS$4.13 Unit price (see Note 13(a)).\nThe fair value measurement of the over-allotment prefunded warrants and warrants immediately prior to the sale\nto the underwriter resulted in a change in fair value of $251,877, which is included in the change in fair value of\nwarrant liabilities in the condensed consolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nAt December 31, 2022, we remeasured the fair value of these warrants using the following assumptions:\nOver-allotment\nPre-Funded Over-allotment\nWarrants Warrants Warrants (1)\nNumber of securities 3 ,282,533 199,000 375,000\nExercise price (in USD) $ 5 .00 $ 0.01\nShare price (in USD) $ 2 .58 $ 2.58\nExpected life 2 .44 1.00\nDividend $ - $ -\nVolatility 74% 90%\nRisk free rate 4.32% 4.72%\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1 .354 $ 1.354\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 0 .74 $ 2.57 $ 0.74\n(1) Same fair value as calculated for Warrants in the above table.\nDue to the decline in fair value of the warrants since December 9, 2022, we recognized $1,577,950 as a change\nin fair value of warrant liabilities, which was reported in the condensed consolidated net loss and comprehensive\nloss.\n15\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nDecember 2022 Debt Settlement\nOn December 13, 2022, we have entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders (see Note 13(a)),\nwhich resulted in issuing 56,141 Units, same terms as the Units as issued in the Canadian Offering except that\nthe underlying securities are subject to a four-month hold period. Accordingly, this resulted in issuing 56,141\ncommon shares and 56,141 warrant liabilities with an exercise price of US$5.00 per share and maturing on\nDecember 13, 2027. We initially recorded the fair value of the warrant liabilities using the Black Scholes option\npricing model with an underlying stock price equivalent to the unit price of US$4.13.\nAt December 31, 2022, we remeasured the fair value of these warrant liabilities using the Black Scholes option\npricing model with an underlying closing stock price on Nasdaq of $2.58 (the last business day of 2022). The\nremeasurement resulted in a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $24,349, which was reported in the\ncondensed consolidated net loss and comprehensive loss.\n13. Share capital and Contributed Surplus\na) Share capital\nAuthorized\nKWESST is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares.\nIssued Common Shares\nThe following is a summary of changes in outstanding common shares since September 30, 2022:\nNumber Amount\nBalance at September 30, 2022 773,225 $ 19,496,640\nIssued for U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering 3,226,392 $ 13,675,120\nIssued for debt settlements 56,134 $ 233,485\nIssued for conversion of stock units 7,655 $ 379,547\nIssued for warrant exercise 3,571 $ 60,000\nLess: share offering costs for the period $ (3,186,492)\nBalance at December 31, 2022 4,066,977 $ 30,658,300\nU.S. IPO and Canadian Offering\nOn December 9, 2022, we closed the U.S. IPO and the Canadian Offering. In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2.5 million\nunits at a public offering price of USD $4.13 per unit (the “Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and\none warrant to purchase one share of common stock (“Warrant”). The Warrants have a per share exercise price\nof USD $5.00, and can be exercised immediately. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter\npartially exercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share\npurchase warrants (“Pre-Funded Warrants”) at US$4.12 (before underwriter discount) and 375,000 option\nwarrants to purchase common shares at US$0.0001 each. A Pre-Funded Warrant is a financial instrument that\nrequires the holder to pay little consideration (exercise price of US$0.01) to receive the common share upon\nexercise of the Pre-Funded Warrant (see Note 14). The holder of Pre-Funded Warrants has no voting rights. All\nof these warrants expire on December 9, 2027.\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one common share and one warrant to\npurchase one common share, at a price to the public of USD $4.13 per unit. The warrants will have a per common\nshare exercise price of USD $5.00, are exercisable immediately and expire in five years on December 9, 2027.\n16\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nThe closing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of CAD$19.4 million\n(USD $14.1 million), before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.\nThe common shares of KWESST and the Warrants sold in the U.S. IPO began trading on the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket under the symbols “KWE” and “KWESW”, respectively, on December 7, 2022.\nThinkEquity acted as sole book-running manager for the U.S. IPO and PI Financial acted as sole book-running\nmanager for the Canadian Offering.\nAccounting Treatment\nRefer to Note 12 for the accounting of the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering.\nBrokers’ Compensation and Share Offering Costs\nAs consideration for the services provided in connection with the U.S. IPO, ThinkEquity received: (a) a broker-\ndealer cash commission of US$835,000 (or CAD$1,138,105) equal to 7.5% of the gross offering proceeds of the\nU.S. Offering and (b) underwriter warrants (the “U.S. Underwriter Warrants”) to purchase up to 134,950\ncommon shares equal to 5% of the common shares and pre-funded common share purchase warrants issued under\nthe U.S. Offering. Each U.S. Underwriter Warrant is exercisable to acquire one common share at a price of\nUS$5.1625, exercisable as of June 4, 2023, and expiring on December 9, 2027.\nAs consideration for the services provided in connection with the Canadian Offering, PI Financial received: (a)\na cash commission of approximately US$210,000 (or CAD$286,230); and (b) 50,848 compensation options (the\n“Canadian Compensation Options”). Each Canadian Compensation Option is exercisable to acquire one\nCanadian Unit at a price of US$4.13 and expiring on December 9, 2024.\nIn addition to the above brokers’ compensation, we also incurred US$2.1 million share offering costs (or\nCAD$2.8 million) for the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, of which CAD$628,262 was incurred and deferred\nat September 30, 2022.\nThe total brokers compensation (including fair value of U.S. Underwriter Warrants and Canadian Compensation\nOptions) and share offering costs was US$3.4 million (or CAD$4.6 million). This total was allocated\nproportionately to the fair value of common shares and warrant liabilities. Accordingly, CAD$1.4 million\nallocated to warrant liabilities were expensed during the three months ended December 31, 2022.\nShares for Debt Settlement\nWe have entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders, which closed on December 13, 2022,\nfollowing TSXV’s conditional approval. This resulted in issuing 56,141 Units to settle $12,000 of the March\n2022 Loans and USD$223,321 (or CAD$302,197) of the August 2022 Loans, including unpaid accrued interest\nand 10% premium at maturity (the “Debt Settlements”) – see Note 10.

Corporate information\na) Corporate information\nKWESST Micro Systems Inc. (the “Company”, “KWESST”, “we”, “our”, and “us”) was incorporated on\nNovember 28, 2017, under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. Our registered office is located at 550\nBurrard Street, Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and our corporate office is located at Unit 1,\n155 Terrence Matthews Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We have representative offices in the following\nforeign locations: Washington DC (United States), London (United Kingdom), and Abu Dhabi (United Arab\nEmirates).\nWe develop and commercialize next-generation technology solutions that deliver a tactical advantage for\nmilitary, public safety agencies and personal defense markets. Our core mission is to protect and save lives.\nKWESST’s common stock is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (“TSX-V’’) under the stock symbol of KWE,\non the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the stock symbol of KWE and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange\nunder the stock symbol of 62U. Additionally, warrants issued in the United States are also listed on the Nasdaq\nunder the stock symbol of KWESW. Effective May 1, 2023, the warrants issued in Canada are listed on the TSX-\nV under the stock symbol of KWE.WT.U.\nb) Reverse Stock Split\nIn August 2022, we submitted a Form F-1 Registration Statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and applied to have its common shares listed on Nasdaq. In connection with KWESST’s listing\napplication on Nasdaq, we effected a one for seventy (1-for-70) reverse stock split of its common stock on\nOctober 28, 2022 (the “Reverse Split”). Accordingly, all shareholders of record at the opening of business on\nOctober 28, 2022, received one issued and outstanding common share of KWESST in exchange for seventy\noutstanding common shares of KWESST. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Split.\nAll fractional shares created by the Reverse Split were rounded to the nearest whole number of common shares,\nwith any fractional interest representing 0.5 or more common shares entitling holders thereof to receive one\nwhole common share.\nEffective on the date of the Reverse Split, the exercise price and number of common shares issuable upon the\nexercise of outstanding stock options were proportionately adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split. The restricted\nshare units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) have also been adjusted for the Reverse Split. While\nthe number of warrants has not changed as a result of the Reverse Split; the conversion rate for each warrant was\nadjusted from one common share to 0.01428571 common share. All information respecting outstanding common\nshares and other securities of KWESST, including net loss per share, in the current and comparative periods\npresented herein give effect to the Reverse Split.\n2. Basis of preparation\n(a) Going concern\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming we will\ncontinue as a going concern.\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have\nincurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded\nfrom financing activities. We have incurred a $6.9 million net loss and negative operating cash flows of $11.3\nmillion for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 (2022 - $8.1 million net loss and negative operating cash flows\nof $3.9 million). At June 30, 2023, we had negative $1.1 million in working capital (September 30, 2022 –\nnegative $5.4 million).\n7\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2023, and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course\nof business is dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products,\nand the ability to raise additional debt or equity financing, when required. There are various risks and\nuncertainties affecting our future financial position and our performance including, but not limited to:\n• The market acceptance and rate of commercialization of our product offerings;\n• Ability to successfully execute our business plan;\n• Ability to raise additional capital at acceptable terms;\n• General local and global economic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the\nglobal disruption from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nOur strategy to mitigate these material risks and uncertainties is to execute timely a business plan aimed at\ncontinued focus on revenue growth, product development and innovation, improving overall gross profit,\nmanaging operating expenses and working capital requirements, and securing additional capital, as needed.\nFailure to implement our business plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or\nfinancial performance. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required\nin the future. Accordingly, there are material risks and uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about our\nability to continue as a going concern.\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying\namounts and classification of assets, liabilities and reported expenses that may otherwise be required if the going\nconcern basis was not appropriate.\n(b) Statement of compliance\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nIAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board\n(“IASB”). They do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared\nin accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and should be read in conjunction with\nour annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022. However, selected\nexplanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the\nchanges in our financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at\nand for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of\nDirectors on August 14, 2023.\n(c) Basis of consolidation\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements incorporate the financial statements of\nKWESST and the entities it controls.\nControl is achieved where we have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to\nobtain benefits from its activities, are exposed to, or have rights to, variable returns from our involvement with\nthe entity and have the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully\nconsolidated from the date on which control is transferred to us until the date on which control ceases. Profit or\nloss of subsidiaries acquired during the year are recognized from the date of acquisition or effective date of\ndisposal as applicable. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n8\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2023, and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nAt June 30, 2023, we have the following wholly owned subsidiaries:\n(d) Functional and presentation currency\nThese financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars (“CAD”), our functional currency and presentation\ncurrency.\n(e) Basis of measurement\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial\ninstruments measured at fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given\nin exchange for assets.\n(f) Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS\nrequires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of accounting\npolicies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income, expenses, and disclosure of contingent\nliabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized\nprospectively.\nJudgments\nInformation about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the\namounts recognized in these consolidated financial statements are the same as disclosed in Note 2(f) of the\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022, except for the following new item:\n• Note 12 – warrant liabilities: whether the determination of our stock volatility and the expected life of\nthe warrant liabilities are reasonable considering our limited operating history, both are significant\ninputs in the valuation model to fair value the warrant liabilities issued in the U.S IPO and Canadian\nOffering.\nEstimates\nInformation about assumptions and estimation uncertainties at June 30, 2023, that have a significant risk of\nresulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are\nthe same as disclosed in Note 2(f) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September\n30, 2022.\n9\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2023, and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nCOVID-19 Uncertainties\nThere is no change to our COVID-19 assessment from the disclosure provided in Note 2(f) of the audited\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022.\n3. Significant accounting policies\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the accounting policies in these condensed consolidated interim\nfinancial statements are the same as those applied in KWESST’s consolidated financial statements as at and for\nthe year ended September 30, 2022.\n4. Acquisition\nOn December 15, 2021, we acquired 2720178 Ontario Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation, which owns all of\nthe issued and outstanding shares of Police Ordnance Company Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation (together,\n“Police Ordnance”), herein referred as the “Police Ordnance Acquisition”. Located in Bowmanville, Ontario,\nwith ancillary operations in Florida, Police Ordnance owns all intellectual properties to the ARWENTM product\nline of launchers, and a proprietary line of 37 mm cartridges designed for riot control and tactical teams. Police\nOrdnance has law enforcement customers across Canada, the United States, and abroad. The Police Ordnance\nAcquisition provides us with a strategic opportunity to leverage its law enforcement customer base to accelerate\ngrowth within its specialty ordnance business.\nWe accounted for the acquisition of Police Ordinance pursuant to IFRS 3, Business Combinations.\nConsideration Transferred:\nThe purchase consideration comprised of the following:\nNumber Fair Value\nCommon shares 3,965 $ 377,503\nWarrants 200,000 $ 132,000\nContingent shares 875 $ 83,319\nTotal fair value purchase consideration $ 592,822\nThe warrants are exercisable at $1.72 each and will expire on December 15, 2024. As a result of the Reverse\nSplit (see Note 1(b)), each warrant converts into 0.01428571 common share or 70 warrants to receive one\ncommon share of KWESST.\nWe issued the 875 contingent common shares to the sellers in April 2022 following the fulfillment of the financial\nmilestone as defined in the share purchase agreement.\nWe have estimated the fair value as follows:\n• Common shares: based on KWESST’s closing stock price on December 15, 2021.\n• Warrants: based on using the Black Scholes option model with the following key inputs: a) exercise\nprice of $1.72, 1/70 of the underlying stock price of $1.36, risk free rate of 1.04%, expected life of three\nyears, and expected volatility of 84.7%.\n• Contingent shares: based on KWESST’s closing stock price on December 15, 2021, and high\nprobability of achieving the financial milestone as defined in the share purchase agreement.\n10\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2023, and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nThe net cash inflow as at the closing of the acquisition was as follows:\nCash assumed on acquisition $ 162,547\nless: consideration paid in cash -\nNet cash inflow on acquisition $ 162,547\nNet Assets Acquired:\nThe purchase consideration was allocated to Police Ordnance’s net assets as follows:\nTotal purchase consideration at fair value $ 592,822\nPolice Ordnance's net assets:\nCash 162,547\nTrade and other receivables 104,432\nInventories 352,685\nIntangible assets:\nPurchase orders 100,000\nCustomer relationships 50,000\nARWENTM tradename 44,000\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 82,963\nCorporate tax liability 32,338\nContract liabilities 29,861\nBorrowings 26,238\nDeferred tax liabilities 49,442\nNet assets at fair value $ 592,822\nAs a result of the above purchase price allocation, we have recorded no goodwill for the Police Ordnance\nAcquisition.\nImpact on KWESST’s Results of Operations:\nThe results of operations of Police Ordnance are included in these unaudited condensed consolidated interim\nstatements of net loss and comprehensive loss from December 16, 2021. If the acquisition had occurred on\nOctober 1, 2021, management estimates that Police Ordnance would have contributed approximately $341,500\nand $623,800 of revenue and approximately $51,600 and $2,500 of net profit to KWESST’s operating results\nfor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022, respectively.

As part of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, we have issued 3,226,392 warrants (the\n“2022 Warrants”) with an exercise price of US$5.00 per share. Additionally, the U.S. underwriter exercised its\nover-allotment option to purchase:\n• 199,000 Pre-Funded Warrants with an exercise price of US$0.01 per share for $3.81024 per pre-funded\nwarrant (net of underwriter discount);\n• 375,000 warrants with exercise price of US$5.00 per share for $0.0001 per warrant;\nRefer to Note 13(a) for further information on the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering.\nUnder IFRS, the above securities are classified as financial liabilities (referred herein as “warrant liabilities”)\nbecause the exercise price is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is different to our functional currency (Canadian\ndollars). Accordingly, the ultimate proceeds in Canadian dollars from the potential exercise of the above\nsecurities are not known at inception. These financial liabilities are classified and measured at FVTPL (see Note\n3(c) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022). Gains on\nrevaluation of the warrant liabilities are presented in Other income (expenses) on the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nWarrant liabilities\nWhile the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO were listed on Nasdaq and closed at US$0.90 per warrant on December\n9, 2022, management concluded that this closing price was not reflective of an active market due to short trading\n14\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2023, and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nwindow and therefore not representative of fair value. Accordingly, at inception, the 2022 Warrants were\nmeasured at fair value using the Black Scholes option pricing model (Level 2). We used the following\nassumptions:\nOver-allotment\n2022 Pre-Funded Over-allotment\nWarrants Warrants (1) Warrants (2)\nNumber of dilutive securities 3,282,533 199,000 375,000\nExercise price (in USD) $ 5.00 $ 0.01\nShare price (in USD) $ 4.13 $ 3.08\nExpected life 2.50\nDividend $ -\nVolatility 75%\nRisk free rate 4.20%\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1.363\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 1.43 $ 4.18 $ 1.43\n(1) Fair value is measured at the underlying common share closing price on Nasdaq on December 9, 2022, less US$0.01 exercise price.\n(2) Same fair value as calculated for Warrants.\nThe share price (in USD) for the over-allotment pre-funded warrants was based on the estimated fair value of\nthe common shares issued on December 9, 2022, by deducting the fair value of the warrants of US$1.05 from\nthe US$4.13 Unit price and the exercise price of US$0.01 (see Note 13(a)).\nBased on the above fair value, the issuance of the over-allotment pre-funded warrants and warrants to the\nunderwriter resulted in a non-cash charge of $251,877, which is included in the change in fair value of warrant\nliabilities in the condensed consolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nAt June 30, 2023, we remeasured the fair value of these warrants using the following assumptions:\nOver-allotment\n2022 Pre-Funded Over-allotment\nWarrants (1) Warrants (2) Warrants (1)\nNumber of securities 3,282,533 199,000 375,000\nNasdaq closing price (in USD) $ 0.45 $ 3.23 $ 0.45\nExchange rate (USD/CAD) $ 1.324 $ 1.324 $ 1.324\nFair value per warrant (CAD) $ 0.60 $ 4.26 $ 0.60\n(1) Fair value is based on the Nasdaq closing pricing on June 30, 2023, for the warrants.\n(2) Fair value is measured at the Nasdaq closing price on June 30, 2023, for the underlying common stock less US$0.01 exercise price.\nIncluding the non-cash charge for the issuance of the over-allotment pre-funded warrants and warrants to the\nunderwriter, we recognized $481,704 as a gain in fair value and $2,707,691 as a loss in fair value of warrant\nliabilities during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, which was reported in the\ncondensed consolidated net loss and comprehensive loss.\nDecember 2022 Debt Settlement\nOn December 13, 2022, we have entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders (see Note 13(a)),\nwhich resulted in issuing 56,141 Units, same terms as the Units as issued in the Canadian Offering except that\n15\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2023, and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nthe underlying securities are subject to a four-month hold period. Accordingly, this resulted in issuing 56,141\ncommon shares and 56,141 warrant liabilities with an exercise price of US$5.00 per share and maturing on\nDecember 13, 2027. We initially recorded the fair value of the warrant liabilities using the Black Scholes option\npricing model with an underlying stock price equivalent to the unit price of US$4.13.\nAt June 30, 2023, we remeasured the fair value of these warrant liabilities using the Nasdaq closing price on\nJune 30, 2023, of US$0.45. The remeasurement resulted in a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $4,726\nand $47,158 for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, which was reported in the\ncondensed consolidated net loss and comprehensive loss.\n13.

In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2.5 million\nunits at a public offering price of USD $4.13 per unit (the “Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and\none warrant to purchase one share of common stock (“Warrant”). The Warrants have a per share exercise price\nof USD $5.00 and can be exercised immediately. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter\npartially exercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share\npurchase warrants (“Pre-Funded Warrants”) at US$4.12 (before underwriter discount) and 375,000 option\nwarrants to purchase common shares at US$0.0001 each. A Pre-Funded Warrant is a financial instrument that\nrequires the holder to pay little consideration (exercise price of US$0.01) to receive the common share upon\nexercise of the Pre-Funded Warrant (see Note 14). The holder of Pre-Funded Warrants has no voting rights. All\nof these warrants expire on December 9, 2027.\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one common share and one warrant to\npurchase one common share, at a price to the public of USD $4.13 per unit. The warrants will have a per common\nshare exercise price of USD $5.00, are exercisable immediately and expire in five years on December 9, 2027.\nEffective May 1, 2023, the warrants are listed on the TSX-V under the stock symbol of KWE.WT.U.\nThe closing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of CAD$19.4 million\n(USD $14.1 million), before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.\n16\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2023, and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nThe common shares of KWESST and the Warrants sold in the U.S. IPO began trading on the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket under the symbols “KWE” and “KWESW”, respectively, on December 7, 2022.\nThinkEquity acted as sole book-running manager for the U.S. IPO and PI Financial acted as sole book-running\nmanager for the Canadian Offering.\nAccounting Treatment\nRefer to Note 12 for the accounting of the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering.\nBrokers’ Compensation and Share Offering Costs\nAs consideration for the services provided in connection with the U.S. IPO, ThinkEquity received: (a) a broker-\ndealer cash commission of US$835,000 (or CAD$1,138,105) equal to 7.5% of the gross offering proceeds of the\nU.S. Offering and (b) underwriter warrants (the “U.S. Underwriter Warrants”) to purchase up to 134,950\ncommon shares equal to 5% of the common shares and pre-funded common share purchase warrants issued under\nthe U.S. Offering. Each U.S. Underwriter Warrant is exercisable to acquire one common share at a price of\nUS$5.1625, exercisable as of June 4, 2023, and expiring on December 9, 2027.\nAs consideration for the services provided in connection with the Canadian Offering, PI Financial received: (a)\na cash commission of approximately US$210,000 (or CAD$286,230); and (b) 50,848 compensation options (the\n“Canadian Compensation Options”). Each Canadian Compensation Option is exercisable to acquire one\nCanadian Unit at a price of US$4.13 and expiring on December 9, 2024.\nIn addition to the above brokers’ compensation, we also incurred US$2.1 million share offering costs (or\nCAD$2.8 million) for the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, of which CAD$628,262 was incurred and deferred\nat September 30, 2022.\nThe total brokers compensation (including fair value of U.S. Underwriter Warrants and Canadian Compensation\nOptions) and share offering costs was US$3.2 million (or CAD$4.4 million). This total was allocated\nproportionately to the fair value of common shares and warrant liabilities. Accordingly, CAD$1.3 million\nallocated to warrant liabilities were expensed during the nine months ended June 30, 2023.\nShares for Debt Settlement\nWe have entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders, which closed on December 13, 2022,\nfollowing TSXV’s conditional approval. This resulted in issuing 56,141 Units to settle $12,000 of the March\n2022 Loans and USD$223,321 (or CAD$302,197) of the August 2022 Loans, including unpaid accrued interest\nand 10% premium at maturity (the “Debt Settlements”) – see Note 10.

The Company has yet to finalize the lease agreement. Terms of the accepted offer to lease included\ncommencement on August 1, 2023, and expiring on June 30, 2026, for a total commitment of $208,285. The\nCompany has not yet commenced occupation of the space, however, expects to in Q4.\n20. Segmented information\nOur Executive Chairman has been identified as the chief operating decision maker. Our Executive Chairman\nevaluates the performance of KWESST and allocates resources based on the information provided by our internal\nmanagement system at a consolidated level. We have determined that we have only one operating segment.\nAt June 30, 2023, the majority of our property and equipment are located in Canada, including the right-of-use\nassets.\n21. Subsequent Event\nOn July 21, 2023, the Company announced the closing of a US$5.688 million private placement in the United\nStates. As part of the offering the Company issued 1,542,194 common shares at a price of US$2.26 (CAD$2.98)\nper common share and 930,548 pre-funded warrants at a price of us$2.26 (CAD$2.98) per pre-funded warrant,\nwith each common share and pre-funded warrant being bundled with one common share purchase warrant of the\nCompany. Each pre-funded warrant entitles the holder to acquire one common share at an exercise price of\nUS$0.01 per common share, and each common warrant is immediately exercisable and entitles the holder to\nacquire one common share at an exercise price of US$2.66 (CAD$3.50) per common share for a period of 60\nmonths following the closing of the offering.\nThinkEquity acted as sole placement agent for the Offering. As compensation for services rendered, the\nCompany paid to ThinkEquity a cash fee of US$475,013.14 representing 8.5% of the aggregate gross proceeds\nof the Offering and issued 123,637 warrants to purchase a number of Common Shares (the “Placement Agent\nWarrants”, representing 5% of the Common Shares and Pre-Funded Warrants sold in the Offering.

Corporate information\nKWEEST Micro Systems Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"KWESST\") was incorporated on November 28, 2017, under\nthe laws of the Province of British Columbia. The Company’s registered office is located at 550 Burrard Street,\nSuite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Its corporate office is located at Unit 1, 155 Terrence\nMatthews Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It also has representative offices in the following foreign locations:\nWashington DC (United States), London (United Kingdom), and Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates).\nKWESST develops and commercializes next-generation tactical systems. Key market segments and solutions\naddressed by KWESST technologies are: (i) breakthrough technology in non-lethal systems with broad\napplication, including law enforcement and personal defence, (ii) modernized digitization of tactical forces for\nshared situational awareness and targeting, and (iii) counter-measures against threats such as drones, lasers and\nelectronic detection.\nKWESST’s common stock is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (“TSX-V’’) under the stock symbol of KWE\nand on the OTCQB® Venture Market under the stock symbol of KWEMF.\n2. Basis of preparation\n(a) Going concern\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming KWESST\nwill continue as a going concern.\nAs an early-stage company, KWESST has not yet reached commercial production for most of its products and\nhas incurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded\nfrom financing activities. KWESST incurred $3.2 million net loss and negative operating cash flows of $1.9\nmillion for the three months ended December 31, 2021 (2020 - $1.5 million net loss and negative operating cash\nflows of $1.2 million).\nThe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the\nnormal course of business is dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders and the ability to raise\nadditional debt or equity financing, as required. There are various risks and uncertainties affecting KWESST’s\nfuture financial position and its performance including, but not limited to:\n• The market acceptance and rate of commercialization of the KWESST’s product offerings;\n• Ability to successfully execute its business plan;\n• Ability to raise additional capital at acceptable terms ;\n• General local and global economic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nKWESST’s strategy to mitigate these material risks and uncertainties is to execute timely a business plan aimed\nat continued focus on revenue growth, product development and innovation, improving overall gross profit,\nmanaging operating expenses and working capital requirements, and securing additional capital, as needed.\nFailure to implement the Company’s business plan could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nfinancial condition and/or financial performance. There is no assurance that that the Company will be able to\nraise additional capital as they are required in the future. Accordingly, there are material risks and uncertainties\nthat may cast significant doubt about KWESST’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying\namounts and classification of assets, liabilities and reported expenses that may otherwise be required if the going\nconcern basis was not appropriate.\n7\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2021, and 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\n(b) Statement of compliance\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nIAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board\n(“IASB”). They do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared\nin accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and should be read in conjunction with\nthe annual consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended September 30, 2021. However,\nselected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding\nof the changes in the Company’s financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial\nstatements as at and for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of\nDirectors on February 28, 2022.\n(c) Basis of consolidation\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements incorporate the financial statements of\nKWESST and the entities it controls.\nControl is achieved where KWESST has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so\nas to obtain benefits from its activities, are exposed to, or have rights to, variable returns from the Company’s\ninvolvement with the entity and have the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company until the date\non which control ceases. Profit or loss of subsidiaries acquired during the year are recognized from the date of\nacquisition or effective date of disposal as applicable. All intercompany transactions and balances have been\neliminated.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company has the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:\nLocation Equity %\nKWESST Inc. Ottawa, Canada 100%\nKWESST U.S. Inc. Virginia, United States 100%\n2720178 Ontario Inc. Bowmanville, Canada 100%\nPolice Ordnance Company Inc. Bowmanville, Canada 100%\n(d) Functional and presentation currency\nThese financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars (\"CAD\"), KWESST’s functional currency and\npresentation currency.\n(e) Basis of measurement\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial\ninstruments measured at fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given\nin exchange for assets.\n(f) Comparative figures\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, KWESST changed the presentation of its expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of net loss and comprehensive loss from by nature to by function. KWESST made this change in\npresentation to provide more relevant financial information to facilitate peer benchmarking, particularly with\npeers in the United States. As a result, KWESST’s operating expenses for the three months ended December 31,\n8\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2021, and 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\n2021 and 2020 are now presented as follows: general and administration (“G&A”), selling and marketing\n(“S&M”), and net research and development (“R&D”).\n(g) Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS\nrequires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of accounting\npolicies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income, expenses, and disclosure of contingent\nliabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized\nprospectively.\nJudgments\nInformation about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the\namounts recognized in these consolidated financial statements are the same as disclosed in Note 2(g) of the\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nEstimates\nInformation about assumptions and estimation uncertainties at December 31, 2021 that have a significant risk of\nresulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are\nthe same as disclosed in Note 2(g) of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30,\n2021.\nCOVID-19 Uncertainties\nWhile COVID-19 has not had a material impact to our business to date, the following is a summary of what we\nbelieve may impact our future business given the persistency of COVID-19: disruptions to business operations\nresulting from quarantines of employees, customers, manufacturers and other third-party service providers in\nareas affected by the outbreak; disruptions to business operations resulting from travel restrictions, including\ntravel to industry tradeshows; and uncertainty around the duration of the virus' impact.\nDespite the global vaccination efforts underway, the extent to which COVID-19 could impact our operations,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Negative\nfinancial results, uncertainties in the market, and a tightening of credit markets, caused by COVID-19, or a\nrecession, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to obtain financing in the future.\n3. Significant accounting policies\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2021, the accounting policies in these condensed consolidated\ninterim financial statements are the same as those applied in KWESST’s consolidated financial statements as at\nand for the year ended September 30, 2021.\n4. Acquisition\nPolice Ordnance\nOn December 15, 2021, KWESST acquired 2720178 Ontario Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation, which owns\nall of the issued and outstanding shares of Police Ordnance Company Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation\n(together, “Police Ordnance”), herein referred as the “Police Ordnance Acquisition”. Located in Bowmanville,\nOntario, with ancillary operations in Florida, Police Ordnance owns all intellectual properties to the ARWEN\nproduct line of less-lethal launchers, and a proprietary line of 37 mm less-lethal cartridges designed for riot\n9\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2021, and 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\ncontrol and tactical teams. Police Ordnance has law enforcement customers across Canada, the United States,\nand abroad. The Police Ordnance Acquisition provides KWESST with a strategic opportunity to leverage its law\nenforcement customer base to accelerate growth within its specialty ordnance business.\nConsideration Transferred:\nThe purchase consideration comprised of the following:\nNumber Fair Value\nCommon shares 277,576 $ 377,503\nWarrants 200,000 $ 132,000\nContingent shares 61,264 $ 83,319\nTotal fair value purchase consideration $ 592,822\nThe warrants are exercisable at $1.72 each and will expire on December 15, 2024.\nKWESST will issue 61,264 common shares to the sellers subject to fulfillment of a financial milestone in Fiscal\n2022 as defined in the share purchase agreement.\nKWESST estimated the fair value as follows:\n• Common shares: based on KWESST’s closing stock price on December 15, 2021.\n• Warrants: based on using the Black Scholes option model with the following key inputs: a) exercise\nprice of $1.72, underlying stock price of $1.36, risk free rate of 0.01%, expected life of three years, and\nexpected volatility of 84.7%.\n• Contingent shares: based on KWESST’s closing stock price on December 15, 2021, and high\nprobability of achieving the financial milestone as defined in the share purchase agreement.\nThe net cash inflow as at the closing of the acquisition was as follows:\nCash assumed on acquisition $ 162,547\nless: consideration paid in cash -\nNet cash inflow on acquisition $ 162,547\nNet Assets Acquired:\nThe purchase consideration was allocated to Police Ordnance’s net assets as follows:\nTotal purchase consideration at fair value $ 592,822\nPolice Ordnance's net assets:\nCash 162,547\nTrade and other receivables 113,483\nInventories 330,413\nIntangible assets 125,529\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 82,963\nCorporate tax liability 29,949\nBorrowings 26,238\nNet assets at fair value $ 592,822\n10\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2021, and 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nThe fair value of inventories and intangible assets in the above allocation is preliminary due to the timing of\nclosing the acquisition near quarter end and the need for additional information related to custom raw materials,\nwhich is subject to further valuation review. This will be finalized by September 30, 2022.\nImpact on KWESST’s Results of Operations:\nThe results of operations of Police Ordnance are included in these unaudited condensed consolidated interim\nstatements of net loss and comprehensive loss from December 16, 2021. If the acquisition had occurred on\nOctober 1, 2021, management estimates that Police Ordnance would have contributed approximately $154,000\nof revenue and approximately $11,800 of net loss to KWESST’s quarterly operating results. In determining these\namounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of the acquisition would\nhave been the same if the acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2021.\nKWESST incurred acquisition-related costs of $2,304 which are recorded as an expense in the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive as part of general and administrative\nexpenses. Share offering costs of $4,150 in relation to the acquisition are recorded against share capital on the\nunaudited condensed consolidated interim statements of financial position.\n5.

Corporate information\nKWEEST Micro Systems Inc. (the “Company”, \"KWESST\", “we”, “our”, and “us”) was incorporated on\nNovember 28, 2017, under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. Our registered office is located at 550\nBurrard Street, Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and our corporate office is located at Unit 1,\n155 Terrence Matthews Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We have representative offices in the following\nforeign locations: Washington DC (United States), London (United Kingdom), and Abu Dhabi (United Arab\nEmirates).\nWe develop and commercialize next-generation technologies that deliver a tactical advantage for military and\nsecurity forces, and personal defense. Key market segments and solutions addressed by our proprietary\ntechnologies are: (i) public safety systems with broad application, including law enforcement and personal\ndefense, (ii) modernized digitization of tactical forces for shared situational awareness and targeted information,\nand (iii) counter-measures against threats such as drones, lasers and electronic detection.\nKWESST’s common stock is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (“TSX-V’’) under the stock symbol of KWE\nand on the OTCQB® Venture Market under the stock symbol of KWEMF and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange\nunder the stock symbol of 62U.\n2. Basis of preparation\n(a) Going concern\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming we will\ncontinue as a going concern.\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have\nincurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded\nfrom financing activities. We incurred $5.5 million net loss and negative operating cash flows of $2.9 million\nfor the six months ended March 31, 2022 (2021 - $3.8 million net loss and $3.1 million negative operating cash\nflows).\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course\nof business is dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders and the ability to raise additional debt or\nequity financing, as required. There are various risks and uncertainties affecting our future financial position and\nits performance including, but not limited to:\n• The market acceptance and rate of commercialization of our product offerings;\n• Ability to successfully execute our business plan;\n• Ability to raise additional capital at acceptable terms;\n• General local and global economic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur strategy to mitigate these material risks and uncertainties is to execute timely a business plan aimed at\ncontinued focus on revenue growth, product development and innovation, improving overall gross profit,\nmanaging operating expenses and working capital requirements, and securing additional capital, as needed.\nFailure to implement our business plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or\nfinancial performance. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required\nin the future. Accordingly, there are material risks and uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about our\nability to continue as a going concern.\n7\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2022, and 2021\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying\namounts and classification of assets, liabilities and reported expenses that may otherwise be required if the going\nconcern basis was not appropriate.\n(b) Statement of compliance\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nIAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board\n(“IASB”). They do not include all the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared\nin accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and should be read in conjunction with\nour annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2021. However, selected\nexplanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the\nchanges in our financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at\nand for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by our Board of\nDirectors on May 27, 2022.\n(c) Basis of consolidation\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements incorporate the financial statements of\nKWESST and the entities it controls.\nControl is achieved where we have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to\nobtain benefits from its activities, are exposed to, or have rights to, variable returns from our involvement with\nthe entity and have the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully\nconsolidated from the date on which control is transferred to us until the date on which control ceases. Profit or\nloss of subsidiaries acquired during the year are recognized from the date of acquisition or effective date of\ndisposal as applicable. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nAt March 31, 2022, we have the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:\nLocation Equity %\nKWESST Inc. Ottawa, Canada 100%\nKWESST U.S. Inc. Virginia, United States 100%\n2720178 Ontario Inc. Bowmanville, Canada 100%\nPolice Ordnance Company Inc. Bowmanville, Canada 100%\nSubsequent to March 31, 2022, we have incorporated the following new wholly-owned subsidiaries:\n• KWESST Public Safety Systems Canada Inc.;\n• KWESST Public Safety Systems U.S. Inc.; and\n• KWESST U.S. Holdings Inc.\n(d) Functional and presentation currency\nThese financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars (\"CAD\"), KWESST’s functional currency and\npresentation currency.\n8\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2022, and 2021\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\n(e) Basis of measurement\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial\ninstruments measured at fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given\nin exchange for assets.\n(f) Comparative figures\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, we changed the presentation of its expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of net loss and comprehensive loss from by nature to by function. We made this change in\npresentation to provide more relevant financial information to facilitate peer benchmarking, particularly with\npeers in the United States. As a result, our operating expenses for the three and six months ended March 31, 2022\nand 2021 are now presented as follows: general and administration (“G&A”), selling and marketing (“S&M”),\nand net research and development (“R&D”).\n(g) Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS\nrequires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of accounting\npolicies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income, expenses, and disclosure of contingent\nliabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized\nprospectively.\nJudgments\nInformation about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the\namounts recognized in these consolidated financial statements are the same as disclosed in Note 2(g) of the\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2021, with the addition of the following:\n• Note 4 – acquisition of Police Ordnance: whether the purchase price allocation applied to the\nconsideration transferred and assumptions used as inputs in determining the fair value of net assets\nacquired is reasonable.\n• Note 10 – unsecured loans: whether the estimated market discount rate used to estimate the fair value\nof the unsecured loans is reasonable.\nEstimates\nInformation about assumptions and estimation uncertainties at March 31, 2022 that have a significant risk of\nresulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are\nthe same as disclosed in Note 2(g) of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30,\n2021.\nCOVID-19 Uncertainties\nWhile COVID-19 has not had a material impact to our business to date, the following is a summary of what we\nbelieve may impact our future business given the persistency of COVID-19: disruptions to business operations\nresulting from quarantines of employees, customers, manufacturers and other third-party service providers in\nareas affected by the outbreak; disruptions to business operations resulting from travel restrictions, including\ntravel to industry tradeshows; and uncertainty around the duration of the virus' impact.\n9\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2022, and 2021\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nDespite the global vaccination efforts underway, the extent to which COVID-19 could impact our operations,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Negative\nfinancial results, uncertainties in the market, and a tightening of credit markets, caused by COVID-19, or a\nrecession, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to obtain financing in the future.\n3. Significant accounting policies\nDuring the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, the accounting policies in these condensed consolidated\ninterim financial statements are the same as those applied in our consolidated financial statements as at and for\nthe year ended September 30, 2021.\n4. Acquisition\nPolice Ordnance\nOn December 15, 2021, we acquired 2720178 Ontario Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation, which owns all of\nthe issued and outstanding shares of Police Ordnance Company Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation (together,\n“Police Ordnance”), herein referred as the “Police Ordnance Acquisition”. Located in Bowmanville, Ontario,\nwith ancillary operations in Florida, Police Ordnance owns all intellectual properties to the ARWEN product line\nof launchers, and a proprietary line of 37 mm cartridges designed for riot control and tactical teams. Police\nOrdnance has law enforcement customers across Canada, the United States, and abroad. The Police Ordnance\nAcquisition provides us with a strategic opportunity to leverage its law enforcement customer base to accelerate\ngrowth within its specialty ordnance business.\nConsideration Transferred:\nThe purchase consideration comprised of the following:\nNumber Fair Value\nCommon shares 277,576 $ 377,503\nWarrants 200,000 $ 132,000\nContingent shares 61,264 $ 83,319\nTotal fair value purchase consideration $ 592,822\nThe warrants are exercisable at $1.72 each and will expire on December 15, 2024.\nWe will issue 61,264 common shares to the sellers subject to fulfillment of a financial milestone in Fiscal 2022\nas defined in the share purchase agreement (see Note 20(a)).\nWe have estimated the fair value as follows:\n• Common shares: based on KWESST’s closing stock price on December 15, 2021.\n• Warrants: based on using the Black Scholes option model with the following key inputs: a) exercise\nprice of $1.72, underlying stock price of $1.36, risk free rate of 1.04%, expected life of three years, and\nexpected volatility of 84.7%.\n• Contingent shares: based on KWESST’s closing stock price on December 15, 2021, and high\nprobability of achieving the financial milestone as defined in the share purchase agreement.\nThe net cash inflow as at the closing of the acquisition was as follows:\nCash assumed on acquisition $ 162,547\nless: consideration paid in cash -\nNet cash inflow on acquisition $ 162,547\n10\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2022, and 2021\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nNet Assets Acquired:\nThe purchase consideration was allocated to Police Ordnance’s net assets as follows:\nTotal purchase consideration at fair value $ 592,822\nPolice Ordnance's net assets:\nCash 162,547\nTrade and other receivables 83,775\nInventories 348,234\nIntangible assets 139,805\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 82,963\nCorporate tax liability 32,338\nBorrowings 26,238\nNet assets at fair value $ 592,822\nThe fair value of inventories and intangible assets in the above allocation is preliminary due to the need for\nadditional information related to custom raw materials, which is subject to further valuation review. This will be\nfinalized by September 30, 2022.\nImpact on KWESST’s Results of Operations:\nThe results of operations of Police Ordnance are included in these unaudited condensed consolidated interim\nstatements of net loss and comprehensive loss from December 16, 2021. If the acquisition had occurred on\nOctober 1, 2021, management estimates that Police Ordnance would have contributed approximately $128,600\nand $282,300 of revenue and approximately $47,300 and $59,100 of net loss to KWESST’s operating results for\nthe three and six months ended March 31, 2022, respectively. In determining these amounts, management has\nassumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of the acquisition would have been the same if the\nacquisition had occurred on October 1, 2021.\nKWESST incurred acquisition-related costs of $2,304 which are recorded as an expense in the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss as part of general and\nadministrative expenses. Share offering costs of $4,150 in relation to the acquisition are recorded against share\ncapital on the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statements of financial position.\n5.

As both product lines have not\nyet reached commercialization, no amortization charge was recorded for the three and six months ended March\n31, 2022 (2021 - $nil). The patent relates to the PARA OPSTM system. Management anticipates the estimated\nuseful life to be five years for both technology assets subsequent to then expected commercialization date and\nthe estimated useful life of the patent will be determined subsequent to the approval of the patent.\n12\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2022, and 2021\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nFor the six months ended March 31, 2022, management concluded there was no impairment on the intangible\nassets (2021 - $55,376).\n8.

Related party transactions\nIn November 2019, KWESST hired SageGuild LLC to assist us in promoting our product offerings in the United\nStates. In January 2021, the Acting CEO and sole shareholder of SageGuild LLC agreed to serve as director of\nKWESST U.S. Inc. and as a result SageGuild LLC became a related party to KWESST. The total cash and share-\nbased remuneration amounted to $82,772 and $169,477 for the three and six months ended March 31, 2022,\nrespectively (three months and six months ended March 31, 2021: $115,528). Except for the cash consideration\nrecorded at the exchange amount, the share-based compensation was recorded at fair value.\nAt March 31, 2022, $36,171 (September 30, 2021 - $23,187) was owed to directors and officers for business\nexpense reimbursements, which was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and paid subsequently.\nAdditionally, $74,000 of borrowings were owed to directors and officers at March 31, 2022 for their participation\nin the Unsecured Loans financing (see Note 10).\n10. Borrowings\nThere were no changes to KWESST’s RBC Credit Facility since September 30, 2021, which consists of a\n$30,000 corporate credit card program collateralized by the short-term investment.\nThe following is a reconciliation of borrowings since September 30, 2021:\nCEBA Term Unsecured\nLoan Loans Total\nBalance, September 30, 2021 $ 53,251 $ - $ 53,251\nAssumed from acquisition (Note 4) 26,238 - 26,238\nIssuance at fair value - 1,634,112 1,634,112\nDeferred financing fees - (74,055) (74,055)\nNet borrowings 79,489 1,560,057 1,639,546\nAccrued interest and accretion expense 3,587 28,089 31,676\nInterest paid - (10,273) (10,273)\nBalance, March 31, 2022 $ 83,076 $ 1,577,873 $ 1,660,949\nCurrent $ 83,076 $ - $ 83,076\nNon-current - 1,577,873 1,577,873\nTotal $ 83,076 $ 1,577,873 $ 1,660,949\nOn March 11, 2022, we closed a non-secured loan financing with various lenders in an aggregate amount of $1.8\nmillion and an additional $0.2 million on March 15, 2022, for a total of $2.0 million (the “Unsecured Loans”).\n13\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and six months ended March 31, 2022, and 2021\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nCertain directors and officers participated in this financing for an aggregate amount of $74,000. The Unsecured\nLoans bear interest at a rate of 9.0% per annum, compounded monthly and not in advance, and have a maturity\nof thirteen months, with KWESST having the option to repay the whole or any part of the Unsecured Loans,\nwithout penalty or premium, at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date. The principal amount\nis due only at maturity. As part of the terms of the Unsecured Loans, we issued an aggregate of 1,000,000 bonus\ncommon shares to the lenders. These common shares were issued pursuant to prospectus exemptions of\napplicable securities laws and therefore subject to a four-month plus one day trading restriction.\nAs a result of issuing common shares and debt for a total combined cash consideration of $2 million, we allocated\nthe gross proceeds to these two financial instruments based on their relative fair value. To measure the fair value\nof the Unsecured Loans, we used the income approach and estimated a market discount rate of 22% to discount\nthe future cash flows of the Unsecured Loans resulting in an estimated fair value of $1.63 million. Accordingly,\nwe allocated $1.63 million of the $2 million to Unsecured Loans and $0.37 million to share capital for the bonus\ncommon shares issued (see Note 12(a)).\nThe total offering costs were $0.09 million, $0.07 million of which was allocated to deferred financing fees and\n$0.02 million allocated to share offering costs. The deferred financing fees are recognized as a reduction of the\ngross borrowings to be accreted over the life of the Unsecured Loans as a financing cost and the share offering\ncosts were recognized as a reduction to common shares.\nAs the Unsecured Loans mature in April 2023, we presented these as non-current borrowings in the consolidated\nfinancial position.\n11.

(the\nCompany) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of net loss and\ncomprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period\nended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our\nopinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\nthe Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and its financial performances and its cash flows for each\nof the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with International Financial\nReporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will\ncontinue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2(a) to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\nhas incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception that raise substantial\ndoubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also\ndescribed in Note 2(a). The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result\nfrom the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are\na public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are\nfree of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides\na reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nChartered Professional Accountants, Licensed Public Accountants\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\nOttawa, ON\nJanuary 27, 2023\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Position\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nIn Canadian dollars Notes 2022 2021\nASSETS\nCash $ 1 70,545 $ 2 ,688,105\nRestricted short-term investment 12 3 0,000 3 0,000\nTrade and other receivables 5 1 71,882 6 99,251\nInventories 6 3 93,538 9 0,299\nPrepaid expenses and other 1 22,166 5 48,042\nDeferred share offering costs 27(a) 6 28,262 -\nCurrent assets 1 ,516,393 4 ,055,697\nProperty and equipment 7 8 32,481 9 03,649\nRight-of-use assets 8 2 08,131 2 66,214\nDeposit 8 2 3,604 2 1,367\nIntangible assets 9 4 ,742,854 3 ,470,919\nNon-current assets 5 ,807,070 4 ,662,149\nTotal Assets $ 7,323,463 $ 8 ,717,846\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nLiabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 10 $ 4 ,459,481 $ 1 ,127,202\nLease obligations 13 6 9,150 3 2,288\nAccrued royalties liability 4(b) 1 50,000 -\nBorrowings 12, 27(b)(c) 2 ,199,978 -\nContract liabilities 14 4 7,271 -\nCurrent liabilities 6,925,880 1 ,159,490\nAccrued royalties liability 4(b) 1 ,115,207 1 ,105,756\nLease obligations 13 2 06,471 2 75,621\nBorrowings 12 7 8,796 5 3,251\nNon-current liabilities 1,400,474 1 ,434,628\nTotal Liabilities 8,326,354 2 ,594,118\nShareholders' Equity (Deficit)\nShare capital 15(a), 27(a) 1 9,496,640 1 7,215,068\nWarrants 15(b), 27(a) 1 ,959,796 1 ,848,389\nContributed surplus 15(c) 3 ,551,330 2 ,458,211\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss ( 101,418) ( 8,991)\nAccumulated deficit ( 25,909,239) ( 15,388,949)\nTotal Shareholders' Equity (Deficit) (1,002,891) 6 ,123,728\nTotal Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity (Deficit) $ 7,323,463 $ 8 ,717,846\nSee Note 2(a) Going concern and Note 26 Commitments and contingencies.\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors:\n(signed) John McCoach, Director (signed) David Luxton, Director\n2 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nConsolidated Statements of Net Loss and Comprehensive Loss\nYears ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\nYear ended Year ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30,\nIn Canadian dollars Notes 2022 2021 2020\nRevenue 17 $ 721,519 $ 1,275,804 $ 861,917\nCost of sales (536,735) (798,888) (247,113)\nGross profit 184,784 476,916 614,804\nOperating expenses\nGeneral and administrative 4,915,263 4,057,167 2,723,861\nSelling and marketing 3,296,373 3,484,159 564,266\nResearch and development, net 21(a) 2,064,493 2,138,138 817,584\nTotal operating expenses 18 10,276,129 9,679,464 4,105,711\nOperating loss (10,091,345) (9,202,548) (3,490,907)\nOther income (expenses)\nFair value adjustments on derivatives -

Corporate information\na) Corporate information\nKWESST Micro Systems Inc. (the “Company”, \"KWESST\", “we”, “our”, and “us”) was incorporated on\nNovember 28, 2017, under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. Our registered office is located at 550\nBurrard Street, Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and our corporate office is located at Unit 1,\n155 Terrence Matthews Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We have representative offices in the following\nforeign locations: Washington DC (United States), London (United Kingdom), and Abu Dhabi (United Arab\nEmirates).\nWe develop and commercialize next-generation technology solutions that deliver a tactical advantage for\nmilitary, public safety agencies and personal defense markets. Our core mission is to protect and save lives.\nKWESST’s common stock is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (“TSX-V’’) under the stock symbol of KWE\nand on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the stock symbol of 62U. As a result of the U.S. IPO (see Note 28\n(a), Subsequent Events – U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering), KWESST’s common stock and warrants issued\nunder the Form F-1 Registration Statement are also listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the\nstock symbol of KWE and KWESW, respectively, as of December 7, 2022.\nb) Reverse Stock Split\nIn August 2022, we submitted a Form F-1 Registration Statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and applied to have its common shares listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”). In\nconnection with KWESST’s listing application on Nasdaq, KWESST effected a one for seventy (1-for-70)\nreverse stock split of its common stock on October 28, 2022 (the “Reverse Split”). Accordingly, all shareholders\nof record at the opening of business on October 28, 2022, received one issued and outstanding common share of\nKWESST in exchange for seventy outstanding common shares of KWESST. No fractional shares were issued\nin connection with the Reverse Split. All fractional shares created by the Reverse Split were rounded to the\nnearest whole number of common shares, with any fractional interest representing 0.5 or more common shares\nentitling holders thereof to receive one whole common share.\nEffective on the date of the Reverse Split, the exercise price and number of common shares issuable upon the\nexercise of outstanding stock options were proportionately adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split. The restricted\nshare units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) have also been adjusted for the Reverse Split. While\nthe number of warrants has not changed as a result of the Reverse Split; the conversion rate for each warrant was\nadjusted from one common share to 0.01428571 common share. All information respecting outstanding common\nshares and other securities of KWESST, including net loss per share, in the current and comparative periods\npresented herein give effect to the Reverse Split.\n2. Basis of preparation\n(a) Going concern\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. The\ngoing concern basis of presentation assumes we will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and can\nrealize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.\nAs an early-stage company, we not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have\nincurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded\nfrom financing activities. We have incurred a $10.5 million net loss and negative operating cash flows of\napproximately $4.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 (2021 - $9.3 million net loss and negative\noperating cash flows of $6.3 million). At September 30, 2022, we had $5.4 million in negative working capital\n(2021 – positive working capital of $2.9 million).\n6 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course\nof business is dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products,\nand the ability to raise additional debt or equity financing, when required. There are various risks and\nuncertainties affecting our future financial position and our performance including, but not limited to:\n The market acceptance and rate of commercialization of our product offerings;\n Ability to successfully execute our business plan;\n Ability to raise additional capital at acceptable terms;\n General local and global economic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the\nglobal disruption from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nOur strategy to mitigate these material risks and uncertainties is to execute timely a business plan aimed at\ncontinued focus on revenue growth, product development and innovation, improving overall gross profit,\nmanaging operating expenses and working capital requirements, and securing additional capital, as needed.\nFailure to implement our business plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or\nfinancial performance. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required\nin the future. Accordingly, there are material risks and uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about\nKWESST’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nSubsequent to September 30, 2022, we closed our U.S. IPO and Canadian public offering on December 9, 2022,\nresulting in total gross proceeds of US$14.1 million or CAD$19.2 million (see Note 27(a)).\nThese consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification\nof assets, liabilities and reported expenses that may otherwise be required if the going concern basis was not\nappropriate.\n(b) Statement of compliance\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting\nStandards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and interpretations of\nthe IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”).\nThe consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors effective on\nJanuary 27, 2023.\n(c) Principles of consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of KWESST and the entities it\ncontrols.\nControl is achieved where we have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to\nobtain benefits from its activities, are exposed to, or have rights to, variable returns from our involvement with\nthe entity and have the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully\nconsolidated from the date on which control is transferred to us until the date on which control ceases. Profit or\nloss of subsidiaries acquired during the year are recognized from the date of acquisition or effective date of\ndisposal as applicable. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n7 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nAt September 30, 2022, we have the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:\nLocation Equity %\nKWESST Inc.

Historical cost is generally\nbased on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.\n(f) Use of judgments and estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make\njudgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities, income, expenses, and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results may differ from\nthese estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized\nprospectively.\nJudgments\nInformation about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the\namounts recognized in these consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes:\n Note 4(a) - acquisition of Police Ordnance: whether the consideration transferred and purchase price\nallocation assumptions used as inputs in determining the fair value of net assets acquired is reasonable.\n Note 4(b) - acquisition of PARA OPSTM System: whether the estimated discount rate used to discount\nthe minimum royalty payments is reasonable, and the reasonability of the volatility assumption used in\nthe Black Scholes option model to estimate the fair value of the warrants issued to DEFSEC.\n Note 10 – unsecured loans: whether the estimated market discount rate used to estimate the fair value\nof the unsecured loans is reasonable.\n Note 15(c) - share-based compensation: whether the determination of KWESST’s stock volatility,\nforfeiture rate, and expected life are reasonable in light of its limited operating history, all significant\ninputs in the valuation model to fair value options granted; and\n8 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\n Note 15(c) - broker compensation options: whether the Monte Carlo valuation model and number of\nsimulations, coupled with the volatility assumption, are reasonable to estimate the fair value of these\noptions.\nEstimates\nInformation about assumptions and estimation uncertainties at September 30, 2022, that have a significant risk\nof resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year is\nincluded in the following notes:\n Note 9 - impairment test of intangible assets: key assumptions underlying recoverable amounts.\nCOVID-19 and Economic Uncertainties\nWhile COVID-19 has not had a material impact to our business to date, the following is a summary of what we\nbelieve may impact our future business given the persistency of COVID-19: disruptions to business operations\nresulting from quarantines of employees, customers, manufacturers and other third-party service providers in\nareas affected by the outbreak; disruptions to business operations resulting from travel restrictions, including\ntravel to industry tradeshows; and uncertainty around the duration of the virus' impact.\nDespite the global vaccination efforts underway, the extent to which COVID-19 could impact our operations,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Negative\nfinancial results, uncertainties in the market, and a tightening of credit markets, caused by COVID-19, or a\nrecession, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to obtain financing in the future.\n3. Significant accounting policies\n(a) Revenue recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of products or services to customers at an amount that reflects\nthe transaction price we expect to receive in exchange for the products or services. Our contracts with customers\nmay include the delivery of multiple products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and\naccounted for as separate performance obligations. The accounting for a contract or contracts with a customer\nthat contain multiple performance obligations requires us to allocate the contract or contracts transaction price\nto the identified distinct performance obligations based on the stand-alone selling price of each performance\nobligation.\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized, for each performance obligation, either over a period of\ntime or at a point in time, depending on which method reflects the transfer of control of the goods or services\nunderlying the particular obligation to the customer.\nFor performance obligations satisfied over time, we recognize revenue over time using an input method, based\non costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion, to measure progress toward satisfying\nsuch performance obligation (for non-recurring engineering services, the input method is based on hours). Under\nthis method, costs that do not contribute to the performance of KWESST in transferring control of goods or\nservices to the customer are excluded from the measurement of progress toward satisfying the performance\nobligation. In certain other situations, we might recognize revenue at a point in time, when the criteria to\nrecognize revenue over time are not met. In any event, when the total anticipated costs exceed the total anticipated\nrevenues on a contract, such loss is recognized in its entirety in the period it becomes known.\nWe may enter into contractual arrangements with a customer to deliver services on one project with respect to\nmore than one performance obligation, such as non-recurring engineering, procurement, and training. When\nentering into such arrangements, we allocate the transaction price by reference to the stand-alone selling price of\neach performance obligation. Accordingly, when such arrangements exist on the same project, the value of each\n9 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nperformance obligation is based on its stand-alone price and recognized according to the respective revenue\nrecognition methods described above. For example, for non-recurring engineering services rendered over a\ncontract period the revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method; whereas for training\nservices the revenue is recognized after the training is delivered (i.e. point in time).\nWe account for a contract modification, which consists of a change in the scope or price (or both) of a contract,\nas a separate contract when the remaining goods or services to be delivered after the modification are distinct\nfrom those delivered prior to the modification and the price of the contract increases by an amount of\nconsideration to a price which reflects KWESST’s stand-alone selling price of the additional promised goods or\nservices. When the contract modification is not accounted for as a separate contract, we recognize an adjustment\nto revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis at the date of contract modification.\nThe timing of revenue recognition often differs from performance payment schedules, resulting in revenue that\nhas been earned but not billed. These amounts are included in unbilled receivables. Amounts billed in accordance\nwith customer contracts, but not yet earned, are recorded and presented as part of contract liabilities.\nWhen a contract includes a significant financing component, the value of such component is excluded from the\ntransaction price and is recognized separately as finance income or expense, as applicable.\n(b) Business combinations\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is\nmeasured as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the net recognized amount of the estimated fair\nvalue of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date. Transaction\ncosts that we incur in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. We use our best estimates\nand assumptions to reasonably value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as\ncontingent consideration, where applicable, and these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to\nrefinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date,\nwe may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill.\nUpon conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities\nassumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in profit or loss.\nWhere the total purchase consideration is less than the fair value of identifiable net assets, we recognize a gain\non acquisition.\nAcquisitions that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as asset acquisitions in accordance\nwith the relevant IFRS standards and applicable to the type of asset acquired.\n(c) Financial instruments\nWe recognize a financial asset or a financial liability when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the\ninstrument.\nTrade and other receivables without a significant financing component are initially measured at the transaction\nprice. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value. Transaction costs\nthat are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”)) are added to or deducted\nfrom the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction\ncosts directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit\nor loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\nFinancial assets\nAll financial assets are recognized and de-recognized on trade date.\n10 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nFinancial assets are recognized at fair value and subsequently classified and measured at:\na) Amortized cost;\nb) Fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”); or\nc) Fair value though profit or loss (“FVTPL”).\nWe determine the classification of our financial assets on the basis of both the business model for managing the\nfinancial assets and the contractual cash flows characteristics of the financial asset. Financial assets are not\nreclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless we change our business model for managing financial\nassets.\nA financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold\nassets to collect contractual cash flows, and its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that\nare solely payments of principal and interest of the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets classified at\namortized cost are measured using the effective interest method. At September 30, 2022, we classified the\nfollowing as amortized cost:\n Cash\n Restricted short-term investment\n Trade and other receivables\n Lease deposit (non-current other asset)\nAll financial assets not classified and measured at amortized cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. At\nSeptember 30, 2022, we did not have financial assets classified as FVOCI or FVTPL.\nExpected credit losses\nWe measure a loss allowance based on the lifetime expected credit losses. Lifetime expected credit losses are\nestimated based on factors such as our past experience of collecting payments, the number of delayed payments\nin the portfolio past the average credit period, observable changes in national or local economic conditions that\ncorrelate with default on receivables, financial difficulty of the borrower, and it becoming probable that the\nborrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organization.\nFinancial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\nFinancial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are recognized at fair value and subsequently classified and measured at amortized cost or\nfair value though profit or loss (“FVTPL”).\nWe determine the classification of our financial liabilities at initial recognition. We have classified the following\nas amortized costs:\n Accounts payable and accrued liabilities\n Corporate tax payable\n Borrowings\n Lease obligations\n Accrued royalties liability\nFinancial liabilities at amortized cost are measured using the effective interest rate method.\nDe-recognition of financial liabilities\nKWESST de-recognizes financial liabilities when its obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.\n11 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\n(d) Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash investments in interest-bearing accounts and term deposits which can\nreadily be redeemed for cash without penalty or are issued for terms of three months or less from dated of\nacquisition.\n(e) Inventories\nKWESST’s inventories may consist of raw materials, work-in-progress (“WIP”), and finished goods. Inventories\nare measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined using the weighted average\ncost method. The cost of WIP and finished goods includes the cost of raw materials, direct labour, and overhead.\nNet realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of\ncompletion and selling expenses. At each reporting period, management estimates the provision for obsolete and\nslow-moving inventory which may be reversed in subsequent periods, should the value subsequently be\nrecovered.\n(f) Property and equipment\nProperty and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\nCost comprises the fair value of consideration given to acquire or construct an asset and includes the direct\ncharges associated with bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for putting it into use along\nwith the future cost of dismantling and removing the asset. These assets are depreciated over their estimated\nuseful lives using the straight-line method as this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of\nthe future economic benefits. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each\nfinancial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.\nThe following table provides a summary of estimated useful lives for our property and equipment:\nRate\nComputer equipment 3 years\nComputer software 3 years\nOffice furniture and equipment 5 years\nLow-rate initial production equipment 5 years\nR&D equipment 5 years\nSales demo equipment 2 years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of useful life or remaining term of lease\nAt the end of each reporting period, we review the carrying amounts of its property and equipment to determine\nwhether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset\nis estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). The recoverable amount is the higher\nof fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are\ndiscounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time\nvalue of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be\ntested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from\ncontinuing use that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-\ngenerating unit, or CGU”). If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount,\nthe carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized\nimmediately in profit or loss.\nAssets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\n12 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\n(g) Leases\nAt inception of a contract, we assess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease based on whether the contract\nconveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nWe recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The lease obligation is\nmeasured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease,\ndiscounted using its incremental borrowing rate at the inception of the lease (it was 10% for the current\noutstanding lease agreement). The right-of-use asset is initially measured based on the initial amount of the lease\nliability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs\nincurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset\nor the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The assets are depreciated to the earlier of\nthe end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the lease term using the straight-line method as this most\nclosely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits. The lease term includes\nperiods covered by an option to extend if we are reasonably certain to exercise that option. In addition, the right-\nof-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the\nlease liability.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the\ncommencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily\ndetermined, our incremental borrowing rate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are\nnot included in the measurement of the lease liability.\nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there\nis a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in our estimate\nof the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if we change our assessment of whether\nit will exercise a purchase, extension, or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way,\na corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying value of the right-of-use asset or, is recorded in profit or loss\nif the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\nWe have elected to apply the practical expedient not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-\nterm leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The lease payments\nassociated with these leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n(h) Intangible assets\n(i) Research and development (“R&D”) costs\nExpenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical\nknowledge and understanding, is recognized in profit or loss when incurred.\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalized only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or\nprocess is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and we have the\nintention and sufficient resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset. The expenditure\ncapitalized in respect of development activities includes the cost of materials, direct labor and overhead\ncosts that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use, and capitalized borrowing\ncosts. Other development expenditures are recognized in profit or loss when incurred.\n(ii) Subsequent expenditure\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the\nspecific asset to which it relates. All other expenditures, including expenditure on internally generated\ngoodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.\n13 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\n(iii) Acquired intangible assets\nAcquired intangible assets consist of open customer orders, tradenames, customer relationships, patents,\nand technology assets acquired either through an asset purchase or a business combination transaction.\nThese intangible assets are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date.\nAfter initial recognition, except for open customer orders, intangible assets are measured at cost less any\naccumulated amortization and impairment losses. For open customer orders, we reduce the amount when\nwe have delivered under the customer contract, with an offset to accounts receivable (i.e. there is no revenue\nrecognized for acquired open customer orders). Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Amortization begins when the related acquired\ntechnology is commercialized. We anticipate the estimated useful life for the current technology assets to\nbe five years once commercialized.\n(iv) Amortization\nAmortization is a systematic allocation of the amortizable amount of an intangible asset of its useful life.\nThe amortizable amount is the cost of the asset less its estimated residual value. We recognize in profit or\nloss on a sales-based rate over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets from the date they are\navailable for use, since this method most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future\neconomic benefits embodied in each asset. Where a sales-based rate could not be determined, the straight-\nline approach is used.\nInternally generated intangible assets are not systematically amortized as long as they are not available for\nuse i.e. they are not yet in working condition for their intended use. Accordingly, intangible assets such as\ndevelopment costs are tested for impairment at least once a year, until such date as they are available for\nuse.\n(v) Impairment\nAll intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment. The estimated present value of future cash\nflows associated with the intangible asset is determined and an impairment loss is recognized for the\ndifference between this amount and the carrying amount as follows: the carrying amount of the asset is\nreduced to estimated present value of the future cash flows associated with the asset, discounted at the\nfinancial asset’s original effective interest rate, and the resulting loss is directly recognized in profit or loss\nfor the period.\n(i) Provisions\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, we have a present legal or constructive obligation that\ncan be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the\nobligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects\ncurrent market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the liability. The accretion of the\ndiscount is recognized as a finance cost.\n(j) Income taxes\nIncome tax expense comprises current income tax expense and deferred income tax expense. Current and\ndeferred income taxes are recognized as an expense and included in profit or loss for the period, except to the\nextent that the tax arises from a transaction which is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in\nshareholder's deficiency.\n14 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nCurrent income tax\nCurrent tax expense is the amount of income taxes payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable income (tax\nloss) for a period. Current liabilities (assets) for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected\nto be paid to (recovered from) the taxation authorities, using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively\nenacted by the end of the reporting period.\nDeferred income tax\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the temporary differences between transactions and carrying\namounts of assets and liabilities that have been included in the consolidated financial statements and the amounts\nused for taxation purposes. Deferred income taxes are provided for using the liability method. Under the liability\nmethod, deferred income taxes are recognized for all significant temporary differences between the tax and\nfinancial statement bases of assets and liabilities and for certain carry-forward items. Deferred income tax assets\nare recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. Deferred\ntax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent it is no longer probable that the related\ntax benefit will be realized.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the\nasset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively\nenacted at the reporting period. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes\nin tax laws and rates on the date of the enactment or substantive enactment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\noffset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when\nthey relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and we intend to settle our current tax assets\nand liabilities on a net basis.\nInvestment tax credits\nInvestment tax credits relating to scientific research and experimental development expenditures are recorded in\nthe fiscal period the qualifying expenditures are incurred based on management’s interpretation of applicable\nlegislation in the Income Tax Act of Canada. Credits are recorded provided there is reasonable assurance that\nthe tax credit will be realized. Credits claimed are subject to review by the Canada Revenue Agency.\nCredits claimed in connection with R&D activities are accounted for using the cost reduction method. Under this\nmethod, assistance and credits relating to the acquisition of equipment is deducted from the cost of the related\nassets, and those relating to current expenditures, which are primarily salaries and related benefits, are included\nin the determination of profit or loss as a reduction of the R&D expenses.\n(k) Related party transactions\nParties are considered to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or\nexercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Parties are also\nconsidered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence. Related parties\nmay be individuals or corporate entities. A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there\nis a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties. Related party transactions are in the normal\ncourse of business and have commercial substance.\n(l) Share-based compensation\nWe have a Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) in which we may grant stock options, restricted share units\n(“RSUs”), performance stock units (“PSUs”), deferred stock units (“DSUs”), and stock appreciation rights\n(“SARs”) to directors, employees and consultants. We measure share-based compensation at fair value for all\nshare-based awards granted under the LTIP.\n15 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nEquity-settled service award\nThe grant date fair value of equity-settled share-based awards is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis\nover the requisite service period, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards.\nFor stock options, the grant date fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option model. For share units,\nthe grant date fair value is based on KWESST’s closing stock price. Each tranche of an award is considered a\nseparate award with its own vesting period and grand date fair value. The amount recognized as an expense is\nadjusted for estimated forfeitures.\nEquity-settled performance award\nThe accounting for equity-settled performance award is the same as above, except compensation expense is\nsubject to periodic adjustment based on the achievement of establishment performance criteria.\nModified award\nWhere the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognized is the\nexpense as if the terms had not been modified and if the original terms of the award are met. An additional\nexpense is recognized for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment\ntransaction or is otherwise beneficial to the employees as measured at the date of acquisition.\n(m) Foreign currency\nForeign currency transactions\nThe financial statements of KWESST and its Canadian wholly-owned subsidiaries are measured using CAD as\nthe functional currency. Transactions in currencies other than in CAD are translated at the exchange rates\nprevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in\nforeign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the rates prevailing at that date. Exchange\ndifferences on monetary items are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Non-monetary\nitems carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at\nthe rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in\nterms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the rates at the date of the transaction and are\nnot subsequently retranslated.\nForeign operations\nThe financial statements of KWESST’s U.S. owned subsidiaries are measured using the United States dollar\n(“USD”) as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities have been translated into USD using exchange rates\nprevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange\nrates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which cases the exchange\nrates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other\ncomprehensive income and accumulated in shareholders’ equity.\n(n) Earnings (loss) per share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is computed using net earnings (loss) over the weighted average number of\ncommon shares outstanding during the period. We use the treasury stock method to compute the dilutive effect\nof options, warrants, and similar instruments. Under this method, the dilutive effect on earnings per share is\ncalculated presuming the exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and similar instruments. It assumes that the\nproceeds of such exercise would be used to repurchase common shares at the average market price during the\nperiod.\nHowever, the calculation of diluted loss per share excludes the effects of various conversions and exercises of\nconvertible debt, options and warrants that would be anti-dilutive.\n16 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\n4. Acquisitions\na) Police Ordnance\nOn December 15, 2021, we acquired 2720178 Ontario Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation, which owns all of\nthe issued and outstanding shares of Police Ordnance Company Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation (together,\n“Police Ordnance”), herein referred as the “Police Ordnance Acquisition”. Located in Bowmanville, Ontario,\nwith ancillary operations in Florida, Police Ordnance owns all intellectual properties to the ARWENTM product\nline of launchers, and a proprietary line of 37 mm cartridges designed for riot control and tactical teams. Police\nOrdnance has law enforcement customers across Canada, the United States, and abroad. The Police Ordnance\nAcquisition provides us with a strategic opportunity to leverage its law enforcement customer base to accelerate\ngrowth within its specialty ordnance business.\nWe accounted for the acquisition of Police Ordinance pursuant to IFRS 3, Business Combinations.\nConsideration Transferred:\nThe purchase consideration comprised of the following:\nNumber Fair Value\nCommon shares 3 ,965 $ 377,503\nWarrants 200,000 $ 132,000\nContingent shares 875 $ 83,319\nTotal fair value purchase consideration $ 592,822\nThe warrants are exercisable at $1.72 each and will expire on December 15, 2024. As a result of the Reverse\nSplit (see Note 1(b)), each warrant converts into 0.01428571 common share or 70 warrants to receive one\ncommon share of KWESST.\nWe issued the 875 contingent common shares to the sellers in April 2022 following the fulfillment of the financial\nmilestone as defined in the share purchase agreement.\nWe have estimated the fair value as follows:\n Common shares: based on KWESST’s closing stock price on December 15, 2021.\n Warrants: based on using the Black Scholes option model with the following key inputs: a) exercise\nprice of $1.72, 1/70 of the underlying stock price of $1.36, risk free rate of 1.04%, expected life of three\nyears, and expected volatility of 84.7%.\n Contingent shares: based on KWESST’s closing stock price on December 15, 2021, and high\nprobability of achieving the financial milestone as defined in the share purchase agreement.\nThe net cash inflow as at the closing of the acquisition was as follows:\nCash assumed on acquisition $ 162,547\nless: consideration paid in cash -\nNet cash inflow on acquisition $ 162,547\n17 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nNet Assets Acquired:\nThe purchase consideration was allocated to Police Ordnance’s net assets as follows:\nTotal purchase consideration at fair value $ 592,822\nPolice Ordnance's net assets:\nCash 162,547\nTrade and other receivables 104,432\nInventories 352,685\nIntangible assets:\nPurchase orders 100,000\nCustomer relationships 50,000\nARWENTM tradename 44,000\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 82,963\nCorporate tax liability 32,338\nContract liabilities 29,861\nBorrowings 26,238\nDeferred tax liabilities 49,442\nNet assets at fair value $ 592,822\nAs a result of the above purchase price allocation, we have recorded no goodwill for the Police Ordnance\nAcquisition.\nImpact on KWESST’s Results of Operations:\nThe results of operations of Police Ordnance are included in these consolidate statements of net loss and\ncomprehensive loss from December 16, 2021. For the year ended September 30, 2022, Police Ordnance\ncontributed revenue of $355,296 and net loss of $198,353 to our consolidated results.\nIf the acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2021, management estimates that Police Ordnance would have\ncontributed approximately $846,600 of revenue and approximately $31,000 of net profit to our operating results\nfor the year ended September 30, 2022, respectively. In determining these amounts, we have assumed that the\nfair value adjustments that arose on the date of the acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had\noccurred on October 1, 2021.\nWe incurred immaterial acquisition-related costs.\nb) LEC System\nOn April 29, 2021, we acquired the Low Energy Cartridge technology from DEFSEC, a proprietary non-lethal\ncartridge-based firing system (subsequently branded as PARA OPSTM system). This technology acquisition\nincludes all intellectual property rights for the PARA OPSTM system. With this acquisition, we will target the\nfollowing four market segments that currently use a variety of dated “non-lethal” or “less-lethal” systems:\n(i) public order (riots and control of dangerous subjects);\n(ii) military and law enforcement training (realistic force-on-force training);\n(iii) personal defence (home, car, boat, RV, camping, hiking); and\n(iv) high-action gaming.\nAs DEFSEC is a private company owned by our Executive Chairman, this asset acquisition is a related party\ntransaction. We relied on exemptions from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements\navailable under Multilateral Instrument 61-101, Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions.\n18 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nHowever, we obtained approval from over 51% disinterested shareholders as well as from the TSX-V prior to\nclosing the acquisition.\nWe accounted for the acquisition of the PARA OPSTM pursuant to IFRS 2, Share-Based Payment.\nThe purchase consideration consisted of:\n 14,286 common shares of KWESST; and\n 500,000 warrants to purchase our common shares at $0.70 each per 1/70 of a common share (70 warrants\nfor one common share); 25% vesting on the first anniversary of the closing of the acquisition and 25%\nper annum thereafter. These warrants will expire on April 29, 2026.\nAdditionally, we will pay 7% royalty on annual sales of the PARA OPSTM system to DEFSEC, net of taxes and\nduties, up to a maximum of $10 million, subject to minimum annual royalty payments starting in 2022. At closing\nof the acquisition, we made an upfront payment of $150,000 as an advance on future royalty payments.\nThe minimum annual royalty payments are as follows:\nDate Amount\nApril 29 2023 $ 150,000\nApril 29 2024 $ 150,000\nApril 29 2025 $ 200,000\nApril 29 2026 $ 200,000\nApril 29 2027 $ 250,000\nApril 29 2028 $ 250,000\nApril 29 2029 $ 300,000\nApril 29 2030 $ 300,000\nApril 29 2031 $ 350,000\nApril 29 2032 $ 350,000\nTotal $ 2,500,000\nThe royalty payment obligation of the Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) will expire in 20 years unless\nterminated earlier under the terms set out in the Agreement. At our sole discretion, we may terminate this\nAgreement for convenience, including if market conditions for sales of the PARA OPSTM system become\nunfavorable subject 60 day’s prior written notice. Upon termination, we will be fully released and discharged\nby DEFSEC including the outstanding future royalties and any unvested warrants shall be immediately cancelled.\nIn return, we will return all intellectual property rights relating to the PARA OPSTM system to DEFSEC.\nThe purchase price was determined as follows:\nNumber Fair Value\nCommon shares 14,286 $ 1,290,000\nWarrants 500,000 $ 425,000\nMinimum royalty payments $ 1,191,219\nTotal $ 2,906,219\nIdentifiable intangible assets\nTechnology asset $ 2,906,219\n19 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nWe estimated the fair value as follows:\n Common shares: based on KWESST’s closing stock price on April 29, 2021.\n Warrants: based on using the Black Scholes option model with the following key inputs: a) exercise\nprice of $0.70, 1/70 of the underlying stock price of $1.29, risk free rate of 0.48%, expected life of three\nyears, and expected volatility of 80%.\n Minimum royalty payments: based on the income approach, specifically discounted cash flows, using a\ndiscount rate of 13.7% per annum.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded $159,451 of accretion cost relating to the discounted\nminimum royalty payments, which is included in net finance costs in the consolidated statements of net loss and\ncomprehensive loss (2021 - $64,537). As at September 30, 2022, $1,265,207 of accrued royalties liability was\noutstanding (2021 - $1,105,756).\nc) Reverse acquisition\nOn September 17, 2020, Foremost Ventures Corp. (“Foremost”) completed the Qualifying Transaction\n(“QT”) with KWESST Inc. pursuant to the policies of the TSX-V. Prior to the completion of the\nQT, Foremost effected a consolidation of its outstanding common shares on the basis of one post-consolidation\ncommon share for every 326.9 pre-consolidation common shares. The QT was done by way of a three-cornered\namalgamation (the “Amalgamation”) pursuant to which, among other things:\n(i) KWESST Inc. amalgamated with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Foremost, incorporated for the\npurposes of the Amalgamation, pursuant to the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (Ontario),\n(ii) Foremost changed its name to KWESST Micro Systems Inc., and\n(iii) all of the outstanding common shares of KWESST Inc. (the “KWESST Shares”) were cancelled and,\nin consideration the holders thereof received post-consolidation common shares of KWESST Micro\nSystems Inc. on the basis of one KWESST Micro System Inc. share for each KWESST Share.\nImmediately following the QT, there were 589,517 shares of KWESST outstanding, of which 576,681 were held\nby the former shareholders of KWESST Inc. (representing approximately 97.8% of the outstanding shares of the\nCompany) and 12,836 were held by the shareholders of Foremost prior to the QT. Accordingly, this transaction\nwas accounted for as a reverse acquisition where KWESST Inc. was deemed to be the acquirer for accounting\npurposes.\nThe reverse acquisition of Foremost was accounted for under IFRS 2, Share-based Payment. Accordingly, the\nfair value of the purchase consideration was accounted for at the fair value of the equity instruments granted by\nthe shareholders of KWESST Inc. to the shareholders and option holders of Foremost.\nThe following represents management’s estimate of the fair value of the net assets acquired and total\nconsideration transferred at September 17, 2020, the closing date of the QT.\nNumber of common shares issued to\nForemost shareholders 12,836\nKWESST's stock price at closing of reverse acquisition (1) $ 49.00\nCommon shares $ 6 28,949\nOptions 41,155\nTotal consideration transferred $ 670,104\n(1) At closing, the subscription receipts issued by KWESST Inc. on July 9, 2020 pursuant to a brokered private placement (the \"KWESST Subscription Receipts\"), were\nautomatically converted, into shares of KWESST. The private placement which was completed through PI Financial Corp. as agent, consisted of 62,994 KWESST\nSubscription Receipts issued at $49.00 per KWESST Subscription Receipt for gross proceeds of about $3.1 million before share issuance costs.

On\nrepayment of the August 2022 Loans, we will pay 110% of the principal amount plus accrued interest on the\nAugust 2022 Loans. As part of the terms of one of the August 2022 Loans, we issued an aggregate of 4,239\ncommon shares to the Lender (the “Bonus Shares”), being an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of\nUSD$200,000, converted to CAD$ at an exchange rate of $1.2983, divided by the market price of our common\nshares on the TSX-V at market close on August 24, 2022, being $12.25. The Bonus Shares were issued in\naccordance with applicable prospectus exemptions under Canadian securities laws.\nAs a result of issuing common shares and debt for the first loan of USD$200,000 (or $260,698), we allocated the\ngross proceeds to these two financial instruments based on their relative fair value. To measure the fair value of\nthe loan, we used the income approach and estimated a market discount rate of 24% to discount the future cash\nflows of the loan resulting in an estimated fair value of $214,893. Accordingly, we allocated $214,893 of the\n$260,698 to the first loan and $45,804 to share capital for the bonus common shares issued (see Note 15(a)).\nConcurrently with the closing of the August 2022 Loans, our Executive Chairman and President and Chief\nExecutive Officer (the “KWESST Principals”) entered into call option agreements with the Lender whereby the\nLender will have the option, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the call option agreements, to purchase\n10,591 common shares held by the KWESST Principals at a price of $12.25 for a period of five years. Additional\nfree-trading common shares may be offered by the KWESST Principals to the Lender should we elect to proceed\nwith a share-for-debt transaction in connection with one of the Loans. KWESST is not a party to the call option\nagreements.\nIn connection with the August 2022 Loans, we paid a cash finder’s fee to a third-party intermediary in an amount\nof USD$32,000.\n25 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nMarch 2022 Loans\nOn March 11, 2022, we closed a unsecured loan financing with various lenders in an aggregate amount of\n$1,800,000 and an additional $200,000 on March 15, 2022, for a total of $2,000,000 (the “March 2022 Loans”).\nCertain directors and officers participated in this financing for an aggregate amount of $74,000. The March 2022\nLoans bear interest at a rate of 9.0% per annum, compounded monthly and not in advance, and have a maturity\nof thirteen months, with KWESST having the option to repay the whole or any part of the March 2022 Loans,\nwithout penalty or premium, at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date. The principal amount\nis due only at maturity. As part of the terms of the March 2022 Loans, we issued an aggregate of 14,286 bonus\ncommon shares to the lenders.\nAs a result of issuing common shares and debt for a total combined cash consideration of $2,000,000, we\nallocated the gross proceeds to these two financial instruments based on their relative fair value. To measure the\nfair value of the March 2022 Loans, we used the income approach and estimated a market discount rate of 22%\nto discount the future cash flows of the March 2022 Loans resulting in an estimated fair value of $1,634,112.\nAccordingly, we allocated $1,634,112 of the $2,000,000 to March 2022 Loans and $365,888 to share capital for\nthe bonus common shares issued (see Note 12(a)).\nThe total offering costs were $90,636, $74,055 of which was allocated to deferred financing fees and $16,581\nallocated to share offering costs. The deferred financing fees are recognized as a reduction of the gross\nborrowings to be accreted over the life of the March 2022 Loans as a financing cost and the share offering costs\nwere recognized as a reduction to common shares.\nAs the March 2022 Loans mature in April 2023, we presented these as current borrowings in the consolidated\nfinancial position.\nFebruary 2021 Loan\nOn February 24, 2021, we entered into an unsecured loan agreement with a private fund managed by a KWESST\nshareholder to borrow $306,000 for general corporate purposes. The interest rate on this loan was 0.5% per\nmonth. On May 27, 2021, we repaid the loan, including accrued interest, for a total of $310,527.\nCEBA Term Loans\nIn December 2020, the Canadian Federal Government amended the CEBA Term Loan program to increase the\nloan amount by $20,000 to $60,000. We borrowed $40,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30,\n2020, and an additional $20,000 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. As a result of the Police\nOrdnance Acquisition (see Note 4(a)), we assumed an additional CEBA Term Loan of $40,000 during fiscal year\nended September 30, 2022.\nThe CEBA Term Loans are initially recorded at fair value, discounted based on our estimated incremental\nborrowing rate. This resulted in recording a gain on government grant of $3,514 for the year ended September\n30, 2021 (2020 - $9,096).\nEffective January 1, 2021, the CEBA Term Loans were automatically converted to a 2-year interest free term\nloan. This was further amended on January 12, 2022, where the government of Canada announced the repayment\ndeadline for the CEBA Term Loans to qualify for partial loan forgiveness is being extended from December 31,\n2022, to December 31, 2023, for all eligible borrowers in good standing. Repayment on or before the new\ndeadline of December 31, 2023, will result in loan forgiveness of up to a third of the loans. Due to our financial\ncondition at September 30, 2022 and 2021, we have not recorded the potential forgivable amount in the event\nwe repay the CEBA Term Loans prior to December 31, 2023.\n26 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nRBC Credit Facility\nWe maintain corporate credit cards for our key employees and a foreign exchange line of credit with Royal Bank\nof Canada (“RBC”). To provide security, we entered into a cash collateral agreement for $30,000 and a general\nsecurity agreement providing a first lien on all assets. The $30,000 was invested in a short-term guaranteed\ninvestment certificate.\nSee Note 27(c), Subsequent Events – Loan Repayments.\n13.

Accordingly, we issued 800,000 Warrants exercisable at $0.285 each for a period of\n24 months from the closing date. Each Warrant converts into 0.01428571 common shares or 70 warrants for one\ncommon share.

Each Unit is\ncomprised of one common share of the Company and seventy common share purchase warrants (“April 2021\nWarrant”).

Our directors and officers purchased 1,029 Units for a\ntotal consideration of $90,000.\nIn connection with this Offering, management has concluded the Unit qualified as an equity instrument under\nIAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation. Furthermore, management used the residual method to allocate the\n$87.50 consideration between common shares and the April 2021 Warrants. Because the April 2021 Warrants\ninclude an accelerator provision for expiration, management used the Barrier option model to estimate the fair\nvalue of these April 2021 Warrants at $0.24 each (70 warrants for one common share). As a result, $70.70 of the\n$87.50 consideration was allocated to common shares and is reflected in the above table of outstanding common\nshares.\nThe total cash and non-cash share offering costs were $630,680 for the Offering, including cash commission of\n$288,405 paid to the Agents and $233,057 of Compensation Options granted to the Agents (see part (c)\nContributed Surplus).\nAsset Acquisition\nIn April 2021, following the closing of the brokered private placement, KWESST closed on the acquisition of\nthe PARA OPSTM System technology resulting in the issuance of 14,286 common shares and 500,000 warrants\n(see Note 4(a)).

Upon\nreceipt of such notice, the holders of Warrants shall have 30 days to exercise the Warrants, failing which the\nWarrants will automatically expire.\nWe paid cash commissions to Haywood Securities Inc. in the amount of $90,000 and granted 45,000 broker\nwarrants (“September 2021 Broker Warrants”).

Management estimated a fair value of $0.72 per warrant, using the Black-Scholes option model (see\nbelow – Warrants).\nIn connection with this private placement, management has concluded the September Unit qualified as an equity\ninstrument under IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation. Furthermore, management used the residual\nmethod to allocate the $140.00 consideration between the common share and the Warrant. Because the warrant\nincludes an accelerator provision for expiration, management used the Barrier option model to estimate the fair\nvalue of these September 2021 Warrants at $0.52 each (70 warrants for one common share). As a result, $103.60\nof the $140.00 consideration was allocated to common shares and is reflected in the above table of outstanding\ncommon shares at September 30, 2021.\nThe total cash and non-cash share offering costs were $130,730 for this private placement.\nAmended License\nIn April 2021, we issued 1,429 common shares for the exclusivity with AerialX as disclosed in Note 26.\nDebt for Equity Settlement\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we settled $19,000 of legal fees for 143 common shares.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, we settled the following liabilities with our common shares:\n $47,000 of legal fees for 816 common shares; and\n $16,866 of online advertising services for 346 common shares.\n2020 Activities\nBrokered Private Placements\nIn September 2020, KWESST closed a brokered private placement led by PI Financial Corp., resulting in the\nissuance of 62,994, at $49.01 each, for aggregate gross proceeds of $3,086,687.

In connection with these 2020 Notes, the note holders earned interest at a rate of 15%\nper annum. Additionally, as an inducement, the note holders also received 25% of the principal amount in the\nform of KWESST common shares based on a stock price of $31.50, resulting in the issuance 8,583 at the QT.\nIn light of KWESST going public in September 2020, resulting in the automatic conversion of these 2020 Notes,\nmanagement concluded that under IAS 38 the recognition of these 2020 Notes should be accounted for as equity\nand not debt. At the QT, these 2020 Notes were converted to 35,398 common shares. Because the 2020 Notes\nwere treated as equity instruments, the total accrued interest of $59,112 was not recognized in the profit or loss.\nThis accrued interest was converted to 1,877 common shares at QT.

The following were key inputs\nused in the Monte Carlo simulation: estimated life of 2 years, underlying stock price of $90.30, exercise price of\nCompensation Option of $87.50, exercise price of 70 Compensation Option Warrants of $87.50, estimated\nvolatility of 80%, risk free rate of 0.31%, and discount for lack of marketability of 0%.\nAccordingly, we recorded $233,057 of Compensation Options in contributed surplus, with an equal offset to\nshare offering costs (a non-cash transaction).\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, the Agents have exercised 2,459 Compensation Option Units for\ntotal gross proceeds of $215,148. At September 30, 2022, the total outstanding Compensation Option Units was\n837.\nShare-based compensation\nOn March 31, 2022, our shareholders approved the amended Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”)\nto retain a competitive compensation structure for its directors, executives, employees, consultants, and service\nproviders. The LTIP allows for the issuance of stock options (“Options”), restricted share units (“RSUs”),\ndeferred share units (“DSUs”), share appreciation rights (“SARs”), and performance stock units (“PSUs”) –\ncollectively referred as Compensation Securities.\nUnder the LTIP, the aggregate maximum number of common shares available for issuance from treasury at any\ngiven time shall not exceed 10% of the outstanding common shares as of the date of Compensation Securities,\nsubject to adjustment or increase of such number pursuant to the terms of the LTIP. Any Options that have been\ncancelled, repurchased, expired, or exercised will again be available under the LTIP. The maximum number of\ncommon shares issuable under the LTIP in respect RSUs, DSUs, SARs, and PSUs (herein referred as “Share\nUnits”) shall not exceed 60,382 shares. The LTIP is subject to annual shareholder approval at the Annual General\nand Special Meeting.\n(i) Stock Options\nAt September 30, 2022, there were 19,833 stock options available for grant under our LTIP.\nThe following is summary of changes in outstanding stock options for the respective periods:\n34 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nWeighted\nNumber of average\noptions exercise price\nOutstanding at December 31, 2019 - $ -\nGranted 2 9,357 $ 45.50\nOptions from the Qualifying Transaction 1,224 $ 32.90\nExercised (1,743) $ 35.00\nOutstanding at September 30, 2020 28,838 $ 45.50\nGranted 5 2,988 $ 104.30\nExercised (18,194) $ 50.40\nCancelled (4,096) $ 48.30\nOutstanding at September 30, 2021 59,536 $ 95.90\nGranted 9 ,500 $ 69.59\nCancelled ( 11,928) $ 131.76\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 57,108 $ 83.87\nOptions exercisable at September 30, 2022 4 3,618 $ 83.90\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we granted 9,500 (2021 – 52,988, 2020 – 29,357) options at a\nweighted average exercise price of $69.59 (2021 – $104.30, 2020 – $45.50).

Financial instruments\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe fair values of our cash, restricted short-term investment, trade and other receivables, accounts payable and\naccrued liabilities, deposit (included in non-current other assets), and related party loans approximate carrying\nvalue because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nUnder IFRS, the levels of fair value hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either\ndirectly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and\nLevel 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not observable market data (unobservable inputs).\nThe lease deposit, lease obligations, accrued royalties liability, and borrowings were recorded at fair value at\ninitial recognition. The fair value measurement for these were Level 2. Subsequently, these were measured at\namortized cost and accreted to their nominal value over their respective terms. At September 30, 2022, the fair\nvalue for accrued royalties liability determined using a discount rate of 24% (2021 – 13.7%) would be $869,219\n(2021 - $1,105,756). Using the same market discount rate, the fair value of the borrowings would be $68,750 at\nSeptember 30, 2022 (2021 - $49,825).\nFinancial risk management\nWe are exposed to a number of financial risks arising through the normal course of business as well as through\nits financial instruments.

At September 30, 2022, our borrowings were all subject fixed interest rate and\ntherefore these were not subject to interest rate risk. At September 30, 2021, our borrowing was interest free.\n(b) Foreign currency risk\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the future cash flows or fair value of our financial instruments that are\ndenominated in a currency that is not our functional currency will fluctuate due to a change in foreign exchange\nrates.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, our revenue was substantially denominated in U.S. dollar\ndriven by contracts with U.S. prime contractors in the defense sector.

Accordingly, we are exposed to the U.S. dollar currency.\nWhere a natural hedge cannot be achieved, a significant change in the U.S. dollar currency could have a\nsignificant effect on our financial performance, financial position and cash flows. Currently, we do not use\nderivative instruments to hedge its U.S. dollar exposure.\nAt September 30, 2022, we had the following net U.S. dollar exposure:\nTotal USD\nNet liabilities in U.S. subsidiary $ 34,623\nUS denominated:\nAssets $ 70,187\nLiabilities (1,015,090)\nNet U.S. dollar exposure $ (979,526)\nImpact to profit or loss if 5% movement in the U.S. $ ( 48,976)\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded foreign exchange gain of $28,780 (2021 – foreign\nexchange loss of $3,742; 2020 – foreign exchange loss of $13,937).\n(c) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to KWESST if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its\ncontractual obligations. Our credit risk exposure is limited to cash, and trade and other receivables. Refer to Note\n5 for the breakdown of our trade and other receivables. We enter into contracts with either large, financially\nsound global general contractors or law enforcement agencies, which mitigates the credit risk. At September 30,\n2022, our trade receivable was $114,877 (2021 - $nil), of which $53,233 was overdue by more than 60 days from\nlaw enforcement agencies.\n(d) Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to meet our financial obligations as they become due. Our\nobjective is to ensure that we have sufficient cash to meet our near-term obligation when they become due, under\nboth normal and stressed condition, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking reputational damage to\nKWESST. A key risk in managing liquidity is the degree of uncertainty in our cash flows due to our early stage\nin operations and the need for additional capital to fund our business strategies (see Note 2(a)).\n44 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nAt September 30, 2022, our contractual obligations were as follows:\nPayment due: Total Within 1 Year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 4,459,481 $ 4,459,481 $ - $ -\nBorrowings 2,648,280 2,548,280 100,000 -\nMinimum royalty commitments 2,500,000 150,000 3 50,000 2 ,000,000\nLease obligations 327,600 93,600 1 87,200 46,800\nTotal contractual obligations $ 9,935,361 $ 7 ,251,361 $ 637,200 $ 2,046,800\nAt September 30, 2022, we had $170,545 in cash and $5,409,487 in negative working capital (current assets less\ncurrent liabilities).

Segmented information\nOur Executive Chairman has been identified as the chief operating decision maker. Our Executive Chairman\nevaluates the performance of KWESST and allocates resources based on the information provided by our internal\nmanagement system at a consolidated level. We have determined that we have only one operating segment.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, all of our property and equipment are located in Canada, including the right-\nof-use assets.\n25. Capital management\nOur objective in managing our capital is to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern and to sustain\nfuture development of the business. Our senior management is responsible for managing the capital through\nregular review of financial information to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet operating\nrequirements and investments to support our growth strategy. Our Board of Directors is responsible for\noverseeing this process. From time to time, we could issue new common shares or debt to maintain or adjust our\ncapital structure (see Note 27). KWESST is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.\nKWESST’s capital is composed of the following:\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2022 2021\nDebt:\nBorrowings $ 2 ,278,774 $ 5 3,251\nLease obligations 275,621 3 07,909\nEquity:\nShare capital 1 9,496,640 1 7,215,068\nWarrants 1 ,959,796 1 ,848,389\nContributed surplus 3 ,551,330 2 ,458,211\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (101,418) (8,991)\nAccumulated deficit ( 25,909,239) ( 15,388,949)\nTotal capital $ 1,551,504 $ 6 ,484,888\n46 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\n26. Commitments and contingencies\nAerialX Drone Solutions (“AerialX”)\nOn April 5, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated licensing agreement with AerialX to gain exclusive\nrights to manufacture, operate, and use its drone for the C-UAS (Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems) market,\nspecifically for the United States Department of Defense and Canada’s Department of National Defence for a\nperiod of two years from the date upon which AerialX will meet certain technical milestones. In consideration\nfor this exclusivity, we have issued 1,429 common shares to AerialX (“Exclusive License Shares”). Based on\nour closing stock price of $95.90 on April 23, 2021 (TSX-V approval date), the fair value for these shares was\n$137,000. We recorded the $137,000 fair value as a license cost for the year ended September 30, 2021, with an\nequal offset to our share capital.\nIn addition to the Exclusive License Shares, we also agreed to issue an additional 1,429 common shares upon\nAerialX achieving the technical milestones. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, AerialX has not\ndelivered on the technical milestones and therefore no recognition was made.\nAdditionally, we also agreed to issue up to 4,286 common shares subject to achieving the following performance\nmilestones:\n# of Common Shares Milestones\n1,071 $3 million in sales\n1,429 $9 million in sales\n1,786 $18 million in sales\nThe amended and restated licensing agreement also changed the terms of the annual minimum royalty payment\nto AerialX. The initial minimum royalty payment is not due prior to the first anniversary year of the Prototype\nDate, which is defined under the agreement as the date upon which a functioning prototype is received by us.\nUnder this agreement, we will pay a royalty ranging from 8% to 15% of sales of AerialX technology, subject to\nthe following minimum payments:\n 1st anniversary: $150,000\n 2nd anniversary: $200,000\n 3rd anniversary: $300,000\n 4th anniversary: $400,000\n 5th anniversary: $500,000\nIn accordance with the original agreement dated November 18, 2019, in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020 we made\na payment of $150,000 as an advance for future royalty payments (the “Advance”). This Advance was recorded\nas a non-current deposit at December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2020. During the year ended September 30,\n2021, management performed a recoverability review of all our financial assets, including this Advance.\nManagement made the recoverability assessment on the Advance based on anticipated future sales of the licensed\ntechnology. Due to the lack of delivery of a functional prototype during the year ended September 30, 2021,\nmanagement concluded the timing and volume of future sales of the licensed drone was too uncertain.\nAccordingly, we took a charge to net loss for the year ended September 30, 2021. This charge is included in\ngeneral and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss. As at\nSeptember 30, 2022, ArielX has not delivered a functional prototype and no further royalties have been paid.\nUnder the amended and restated licensing agreement, we will continue to have non-exclusive worldwide license.\nThis agreement will expire on April 30, 2026.\n47 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\n27. Subsequent Events\na) U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering\nOn December 9, 2022, we closed an underwritten U.S. public offering (the “U.S. IPO”) and an underwritten\nCanadian offering (the “Canadian Offering”). In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2,500,000 units at a public offering price\nof USD $4.13 per unit (the “Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one\nshare of common stock (“Warrant”). The Warrants have a per share exercise price of USD $5.00, can be exercised\nimmediately, and expire five years from the date of issuance. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the\nunderwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common\nshare purchase warrants and 375,000 warrants to purchase common shares. The underwriter has the right to\nexercise the balance of its over-allotment option within the 45-day period.\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one common share and one warrant to\npurchase one common share, at a price to the public of USD $4.13 per unit. The warrants will have a per common\nshare exercise price of USD $5.00, are exercisable immediately and expire five years from the date of issuance.\nThe closing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of USD $14,145,000,\nbefore deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.\nThe common shares of KWESST and the Warrants sold in the U.S. IPO began trading on the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket under the symbols “KWE” and “KWESW”, respectively, on December 7, 2022.\nThinkEquity acted as sole book-running manager for the U.S. IPO and PI Financial acted as sole book-running\nmanager for the Canadian Offering.\nAs consideration for the services provided in connection with the U.S. IPO, ThinkEquity received: (a) a broker-\ndealer cash commission of approximately US$835,000 equal to 7.5% of the gross offering proceeds of the U.S.\nOffering and (b) underwriter warrants (the “Underwriter Warrants”) to purchase up to 134,950 common shares\nequal to 5% of the common shares and pre-funded common share purchase warrants issued under the U.S.\nOffering. Each Underwriter Warrant is exercisable to acquire one common share at a price of US$5.1625,\nexercisable as of June 4, 2023, and expiring December 4, 2027.\nAs consideration for the services provided in connection with the Canadian Offering, PI Financial received: (a)\na cash commission of approximately US$210,000 equal to 7% of the gross proceeds of the Offering; and (b)\n50,848 compensation options (the “Compensation Options”) equal to 7% of the number of Units issued under\nthe Canadian Offering. Each Compensation Option is exercisable to acquire one Canadian Unit at a price of\nUS$4.13 for a period of two years after the closing of the Canadian Offering.\nIn addition to the above brokers’ compensation, we also incurred US$2.3 million share offering costs for the\nU.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, of which $628,262 was incurred and deferred at September 30, 2022.\nb) Shares for Debt Settlement\nWe have entered into share for debt arrangements with existing lenders, which closed on December 13, 2022,\nfollowing TSXV’s conditional approval. This resulted in issuing 56,141 Units to settle $12,000 of the March\n2022 Loans and USD$223,321 of the August 2022 Loans, including unpaid accrued interest and 10% premium\nat maturity (the “Debt Settlements”) – see Note 12. The terms of the Units are the same as the Units issued in\nthe Canadian Offering (see part (a)).\nThe Units, as well as the common shares and Warrants, to be issued pursuant to the Debt Settlements will be\nsubject to a four-month hold period pursuant to applicable securities regulations and the policies of the TSXV.\n48 | Page\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears ended September 30, 2022, and 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share amounts)\nc) Loan Repayments\nIn December 2022, we have repaid the remaining $1,997,435 of the March 2022 Loans, including accrued unpaid\ninterest, and USD$223,321 of the August 2022 Loans, including unpaid accrued interest and 10% premium at\nmaturity. Following these loan repayments, there were no further outstanding loans.\nIn December 2022, we have repaid the CEBA Term Loans net of the total forgivable amount of $30,000.\n49 | Page"

Corporate information\nKWEEST Micro Systems Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"KWESST\"), was incorporated on November 28,\n2017, under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. The Company’s registered office is located\nat 550 Burrard Street, Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Its corporate office is located\nat Unit 1, 155 Terrence Matthews Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nKWESST develops and markets innovative products to create ‘’intelligent tactical systems’’ and\nproprietary technology for game-changing applications in the military and homeland security market.\nKWESST’s core technology has multiple applications based on its micro integrated sensor software\ntechnology, or MISST, a proprietary integration of miniaturized sensors, optics, ballistics and software\nthat provides an advancement in affordable smart systems and mission capability.\nKWESST’s common stock is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (‘’TSX-V’’) under the stock symbol\nof KWE and on the OTCQB® Venture Market under the stock symbol of KWEMF.\n2. Basis of preparation\n(a) Going concern\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming KWESST\nwill continue as a going concern.\nAs an early-stage company, KWESST has incurred significant losses and negative operating cash\nflows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities. KWESST incurred\napproximately $1.4 million net loss and negative operating cash flows of approximately $1.2 million for\nthe three months period ended December 31, 2020 (2019 - $0.7 million net loss and negative operating\ncash flows of $0.8 million) and approximately $3.6 million net loss and negative operating cash flows\nof approximately $1.8 million for the nine months period ended September 30, 2020 (twelve months\nended December 31, 2019 - $1.1 million net loss and negative operating cash flows of $1.1 million).\nAt December 31, 2020, KWESST had a working capital of approximately $1.6 million (September 30,\n2020 – working capital of $2.8 million).\nThe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and realize its assets and discharge its liabilities\nin the normal course of business is dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders, achieving\nsustained profitability and the ability to raise additional debt or equity financing, if required, to fund its\nworking capital requirements. There are various risk and uncertainties affecting KWESST’s operating\nincluding, but not limited to:\n• The market acceptance and rate of commercialization of the KWESST’s offerings;\n• Ability to successfully execute its business plan;\n• Ability to raise additional capital at acceptable terms;\n• General local and global economic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,\ncertain of which are beyond the Company’s control.\nKWESST’s strategy to mitigate these risks and uncertainties is to execute on timely a business plan\naimed at continued focus on revenue growth, product development and innovation, improving overall\ngross profit, managing operating expenses and working capital requirements, and securing additional\ncapital, as needed.\nOn April 6, 2021, KWESST has entered into an agreement with PI Financial Corp., as lead agent and\nsole bookrunner (the \"Lead Agent\"), on its own behalf and, if applicable, on behalf of a syndicate of\nagents (together with the Lead Agent, the \"Agents\") in connection with a best efforts, private placement\n7\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nAmended and Restated Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nof up to 2,000,000 units of KWESST (the \"Units\") at a price of $1.25 per Unit for gross proceeds of up\nto $2,500,000 (the \"Offering\"). On April 9, 2021, KWESST announced the Offering was upsized up to\na total of 3,200,000 Units for total gross proceeds of $4,000,000. Each Unit will be comprised of one\ncommon share of KWESST (a \"Common Share\") and one Common Share purchase warrant\n(\"Warrant\"). Each Warrant will be exercisable to acquire one Common Share (a \"Warrant Share\") at a\nprice of $1.75 per Warrant Share for a period of 24 months from the closing of the Offering. If at any\ntime after four (4) months and one (1) day following the Closing Date, the trading price of the Shares\non the TSX Venture Exchange is equal to or exceeds $3 for a period of 10 consecutive trading days,\nas evidenced by the price at the close of market, KWESST will be entitled to notify the holders of\nWarrants of its intention to force the exercise of the Warrants. Upon receipt of such notice, the holders\nof Warrants will have 30 days to exercise the Warrants, failing which the Warrants will automatically\nexpire. There are no guarantees that KWESST will close on this financing or if the funds raised will be\nsufficient to sustain KWESST’s ongoing operations beyond twelve months or that additional debt or\nequity financing will be available to KWESST or available at acceptable terms. Failure to implement\nthe Company’s business plan could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial\ncondition and/or financial performance. Accordingly, there are material risks and uncertainties that\ncast significant doubt about KWESST’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments or\ndisclosures that would be required if assets are not realized and liabilities and commitments are not\nsettled in the normal course of operations. If KWESST is unable to continue as a going concern, then\nthe carrying value of certain assets and liabilities would require revaluation to a liquidation basis, which\ncould differ materially on the values presented in the financial statements.\n(b) Statement of compliance\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nIAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards\nBoard (“IASB”). They do not include all the disclosures that would otherwise be required for a complete\nset of financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the annual audited financial\nstatements of KWESST’s for the period ended September 30, 2020.\nThese unaudited amended and restated condensed consolidated interim financial statements were\nauthorized for issue by the Board of Directors on April 14, 2021.\n(b) Basis of consolidation\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements incorporate the financial statements of\nKWESST and the entity it controls.\nControl is achieved where KWESST has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of\nan entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities, are exposed to, or have rights to, variable returns\nfrom the Company’s involvement with the entity and have the ability to affect those returns through its\npower over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred\nto the Company until the date on which control ceases. Profit or loss of subsidiaries acquired during\nthe year are recognized from the date of acquisition or effective date of disposal as applicable. All\nintercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company has one wholly-owned subsidiary: KWESST Inc. Subsequent\nto December 31, 2020, the Company has incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary based in the United\nStates named KWESST U.S. Inc. and accordingly, starting with the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the\nCompany will consolidate this new entity.\n8\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nAmended and Restated Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\n(c) Functional and presentation currency\nThese financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars (\"CAD\"), KWESST’s functional currency\nand presentation currency.\n(d) Basis of measurement\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for\ncertain financial instruments measured at fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value\nof the consideration given in exchange for assets.\n(e) Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS\nrequires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of\naccounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income, expenses, and\ndisclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe continuing uncertainty around the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”’) pandemic\nrequired the use of judgements and estimates in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim\nfinancial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2020. The future impact of COVID-19\nuncertainties could generate, in future reporting periods, a significant impact to the reported amounts\nof assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in these and any future financial statements.\nCritical judgments that management has made in applying KWESST’s accounting policies that the\nmost significant effect on the amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated interim financial\nstatements includes the assessment of KWESST’s ability to continue as a going concern (Note 2(a)).\nSignificant areas having estimation uncertainty in applying accounting policies that have the most\nsignificant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements are the same as those that\napplied to the audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the period ended September 30,\n2020.\n(f) Reclassification\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2020, KWESST presented investor relations costs\nseparately in the consolidated statements of net loss and comprehensive loss. For the first quarter\nended December 31, 2020, KWESST reclassified investor relations costs and included these as\nadvertising and promotion costs.\n3. Significant accounting policies\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2020, the accounting policies in these condensed\nconsolidated interim financial statements are the same as those applied in KWESST’s consolidated\nfinancial statements as at and for the period ended September 30, 2020.\n4. New accounting standards issued but not yet in effect\nClassification of liabilities as current or non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)\nThe IASB has published Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS\n1), which clarified the guidance on whether a liability should be classified as either current or non-\ncurrent. The amendments were as follows:\n9\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nAmended and Restated Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\n(i) Clarified that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should only be based on\nrights that are in place at the end of the reporting period.\n(ii) Clarified that classification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise\nits right to defer settlement of a liability; and\n(iii) Made clear that settlement includes transfers to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments,\nother assets or services that result in extinguishment of the liability.\nThis new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. Earlier\napplication is permitted. KWESST has not yet assessed the impact of adoption of this guidance.\nFurther, there is currently a proposal outstanding that would defer the effective date until January 1,\n2023.\n5.

KWESST’s related party loans have fixed interest rate\nterms and therefore KWESST is not exposed to interest rate risk.\n(b) Foreign currency risk\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the future cash flows or fair value of the Company’s financial\ninstruments that are denominated in a currency that is not KWESST’s functional currency will fluctuate\ndue to a change in foreign exchange rates.\nHistorically, KWESST’s revenue was substantially denominated in US dollar driven by contracts with\nU.S. prime contractors in the defense sector. Accordingly, KWESST is exposed to the US dollar\ncurrency. A significant change in the US dollar currency could have a significant effect on KWESST’s\nfinancial performance, financial position and cash flows. At this time, KWESST does not use derivative\ninstruments to hedge its US dollar exposure.\nAt December 31, 2020, KWESST had the following net US dollar exposure:\nTotal USD\nAssets $ 277,782\nLiabilities ( 350,360)\nNet exposure at December 31, 2020 $ ( 72,578)\nImpact to profit or loss if 5% movement in\nthe US dollar $ ( 3,629)\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2020, KWESST recorded foreign exchange loss of $3,385,\n(2019 – loss of $41,617).\n(c) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to\nmeet its contractual obligations. KWESST’s credit risk exposure is limited to cash, and trade and other\n17\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nAmended and Restated Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nreceivables. The counterparty for the trade and other receivables is the Canadian government and a\nU.S. military customer.\n(d) Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that KWESST will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they become\ndue. KWESS’s objective is to ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet its near term obligation when\nthey become due, under both normal and stressed condition, without incurring unacceptable losses or\nrisking reputational damage to KWESST.\nA key risk in managing liquidity is the degree of uncertainty in KWESST’s cash flows due to its early\nstage in operations. KWESST’s working capital at December 31, 2020 was approximately $1.4 million\nand as noted in Note 20, Subsequent Events, KWESST raised additional capital via exercises of\nwarrants and options.\n17.

Corporate information\nKWEEST Micro Systems Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"KWESST\"), was incorporated on November 28,\n2017, under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. The Company’s registered office is located\nat 550 Burrard Street, Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Its corporate office is located\nat Unit 1, 155 Terrence Matthews Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\nKWESST develops and commercializes next-generation tactical systems that meet the requirements\nof security forces and personal defense for overmatch capability against adversaries. Key market\nsegments and solutions addressed by KWESST technologies are: (i) breakthrough technology in non-\nlethal systems with broad application, including law enforcement and personal defence, (ii) modernized\ndigitization of tactical forces for shared situational awareness and targeting, and (iii) counter-measures\nagainst threats such as drones, lasers and electronic detection.\nKWESST has also offices in the following foreign locations: Washington DC (United States), London\n(United Kingdom), and Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates).\nKWESST’s common stock is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (‘’TSX-V’’) under the stock symbol\nof KWE and on the OTCQB® Venture Market under the stock symbol of KWEMF.\n2. Basis of preparation\n(a) Going concern\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming\nKWESST will continue as a going concern.\nAs an early-stage company, KWESST has incurred significant losses and negative operating cash\nflows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities. KWESST incurred\napproximately $6.4 million net loss and negative operating cash flows of approximately $4.7 million for\nthe nine months period ended June 30, 2021 (2020 - $2.2 million net loss and negative operating cash\nflows of $1.7 million). At June 30, 2021, KWESST had a working capital of $2.8 million (September\n30, 2020 – working capital of $2.9 million).\nThe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and realize its assets and discharge its liabilities\nin the normal course of business is dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders and the\nability to raise additional debt or equity financing, if required. There are various risk and uncertainties\naffecting KWESST’s operating including, but not limited to:\n• The market acceptance and rate of commercialization of the KWESST’s offerings;\n• Ability to successfully execute its business plan;\n• Ability to raise additional capital at acceptable terms;\n• General local and global economic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nFailure to implement the Company’s business plan could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s financial condition and/or financial performance. Accordingly, there are material risks and\nuncertainties that may cast significant doubt about KWESST’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nKWESST’s strategy to mitigate these material risks and uncertainties is to execute timely a business\nplan aimed at continued focus on revenue growth, product development and innovation, improving\noverall gross profit, managing operating expenses and working capital requirements, and securing\nadditional capital, as needed.\n7\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments or\ndisclosures that would be required if assets are not realized and liabilities and commitments are not\nsettled in the normal course of operations.\n(b) Statement of compliance\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in\naccordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, (“IAS 34”) as issued by the International\nAccounting Standards Board (“IASB”). They do not include all the information required for a complete\nset of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards\n(“IFRS”) and should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements of the\nCompany for the period ended September 30, 2020. However, selected explanatory notes are included\nto explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the\nCompany’s financial position and performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements\nas at and for the period ended September 30, 2020.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by\nthe Board of Directors on August 24, 2021.\n(c) Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance\nwith IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the\napplication of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income, expenses,\nand disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe continuing uncertainty around the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”’) pandemic\nrequired the use of judgments and estimates in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim\nfinancial statements for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021. The future impact of COVID-\n19 uncertainties could generate, in future reporting periods, a significant impact to the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in these and any future financial statements.\nCritical judgments that management has made in applying KWESST’s accounting policies that have\nthe most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated interim financial\nstatements includes the assessment of KWESST’s ability to continue as a going concern (Note 2(a)).\nSignificant areas having estimation uncertainty in applying accounting policies that have the most\nsignificant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements are the same as those that\napplied to the audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the period ended September 30,\n2020.\n3. Significant accounting policies\nDuring the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021, the accounting policies in these condensed\nconsolidated interim financial statements are the same as those applied in KWESST’s consolidated\nfinancial statements as at and for the period ended September 30, 2020, except as noted below.\nIn light of reporting inventories at June 30, 2021, KWESST added the following new accounting policy:\n8\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nInventories\nKWESST’s inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-progress (“WIP”), and finished goods.\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined\nusing the weighted average cost method. The cost of WIP and finished goods includes the cost of raw\nmaterials, direct labor, and overhead. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary\ncourse of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. At each reporting\nperiod, management estimates the provision for obsolete and slow-moving inventory which may be\nreversed in subsequent periods, should the value subsequently be recovered.\nAdditionally, KWESST has expanded its revenue recognition accounting policy as follows:\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of products or services to customers at an amount that\nreflects the transaction price KWESST expects to receive in exchange for the products or services.\nKWESST’s contracts with customers can include the delivery of multiple products and services, which\nare generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. The\naccounting for a contract or contracts with a customer that contain multiple performance obligations\nrequires KWESST to allocate the contract or contracts transaction price to the identified distinct\nperformance obligations.\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized, for each performance obligation, either over a\nperiod of time or at a point in time, depending on which method reflects the transfer of control of the\ngoods or services underlying the particular obligation to the customer.\nFor performance obligations satisfied over time, KWESST recognizes revenue over time using an input\nmethod, based on costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion, to measure\nprogress toward satisfying such performance obligation (for non-recurring engineering services, the\ninput method is based on hours). Under this method, costs that do not contribute to the performance\nof KWESST in transferring control of goods or services to the customer are excluded from the\nmeasurement of progress toward satisfying the performance obligation. In certain other situations,\nKWESST might recognize revenue at a point in time, when the criteria to recognize revenue over time\nare not met. In any event, when the total anticipated costs exceed the total anticipated revenues on a\ncontract, such loss is recognized in its entirety in the period it becomes known.\nKWESST may enter into contractual arrangements with a customer to deliver services on one project\nwith respect to more than one performance obligation, such as non-recurring engineering,\nprocurement, and training. When entering into such arrangements, KWESST allocates the transaction\nprice by reference to the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. Accordingly, when\nsuch arrangements exist on the same project, the value of each performance obligation is based on\nits stand-alone price and recognized according to the respective revenue recognition methods\ndescribed above.\nKWESST accounts for a contract modification, which consists of a change in the scope or price (or\nboth) of a contract, as a separate contract when the remaining goods or services to be delivered after\nthe modification are distinct from those delivered prior to the modification and the price of the contract\nincreases by an amount of consideration that reflects KWESST’s stand-alone selling price of the\nadditional promised goods or services. When the contract modification is not accounted for as a\nseparate contract, KWESST recognizes an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis at\nthe date of contract modification.\nThe timing of revenue recognition often differs from performance payment schedules, resulting in\nrevenue that has been earned but not billed. These amounts are included in unbilled receivables.\n9\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nAmounts billed in accordance with customer contracts, but not yet earned, are recorded and presented\nas part of contract liabilities.\nWhen a contract includes a significant financing component, the value of such component is excluded\nfrom the transaction price and is recognized separately as finance income or expense, as applicable.\n4. Asset Acquisitions\na) LEC System\nOn April 29, 2021, KWESST acquired the Low Energy Cartridge technology from DEFSEC, a\nproprietary non-lethal cartridge-based firing system (herein referred as the “LEC System”). This\ntechnology acquisition includes all intellectual property rights for the LEC System. With this acquisition,\nKWESST will target the following four market segments that currently use a variety of dated “non-\nlethal” or “less-lethal” systems:\n(i) public order (riots and control of dangerous subjects);\n(ii) military and law enforcement training (realistic force-on-force training);\n(iii) personal defence (home, car, boat, RV, camping, hiking); and\n(iv) high-action gaming.\nAs DEFSEC is a private company owned by KWESST’s Executive Chairman, this asset acquisition is\na related party transaction. KWESST relied on exemptions from the formal valuation and minority\nshareholder approval requirements available under Multilateral Instrument 61-101, Protection of\nMinority Security Holders in Special Transactions. However, KWESST obtained approval from over\n51% disinterested shareholders as well as from the TSX-V prior to closing the acquisition.\nThe purchase consideration consisted of:\n• 1,000,000 common shares of KWESST, subject to four-month hold (August 29, 2021); and\n• 500,000 warrants to purchase KWESST’s common shares at $0.70 each; 25% vesting on the\nfirst anniversary of the closing of the LEC Technology acquisition and 25% per annum\nthereafter. These warrants will expire on April 29, 2026.\nAdditionally, KWESST will pay 7% royalty on annual sales of the LEC System to DEFSEC, net of taxes\nand duties, up to a maximum of $10 million, subject to minimum annual royalty payments starting in\n2022. At closing of the acquisition, KWESST made an upfront payment of $150,000 as an advance on\nfuture royalty payments.\nThe minimum annual royalty payments are as follows:\nDate Amount\nApril 29 2023 $ 1 50,000\nApril 29 2024 $ 1 50,000\nApril 29 2025 $ 2 00,000\nApril 29 2026 $ 2 00,000\nApril 29 2027 $ 2 50,000\nApril 29 2028 $ 2 50,000\nApril 29 2029 $ 3 00,000\nApril 29 2030 $ 3 00,000\nApril 29 2031 $ 3 50,000\nApril 29 2032 $ 3 50,000\nTotal $ 2,500,000\nThe royalty payment obligation of the Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) will expire in 20 years unless\nterminated earlier under the terms set out in the Agreement. At its sole discretion, KWESST may\n10\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nterminate this Agreement for convenience, including if market conditions for sales of the LEC System\nbecome unfavorable subject 60 day’s prior written notice. Upon termination, KWESST will be fully\nreleased and discharged by DEFSEC including the outstanding future royalties and any unvested\nwarrants shall be immediately cancelled. In return, KWESST will return all intellectual property rights\nrelating to the LEC System to DEFSEC.\nThe purchase price allocation was determined as follows:\nNumber Fair Value\nCommon shares 1,000,000 $ 1,290,000\nWarrants 500,000 $ 425,000\nMinimum royalty payments $ 1,090,732\nTotal $ 2,805,732\nIdentifiable intangible assets\nTechnology asset $ 2,805,732\nKWESST estimated the fair value as follows:\n• Common shares: based on KWESST’s closing stock price on April 29, 2021.\n• Warrants: based on using the Black Scholes option model with the following key inputs: a)\nexercise price of $0.70, underlying stock price of $1.29, risk free rate of 0.48%, expected life\nof three years, and expected volatility of 80%.\n• Minimum royalty payments: based on the income approach, specifically discounted cash\nflows, using a discount rate of 16% per annum.\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2021, KWESST recorded $25,567 of accretion cost relating to the\ndiscounted minimum royalty payments, which is included in net finance costs in the condensed\nconsolidated interim statement of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nb) GhostStep® Technology\nOn June 12, 2020, KWESST acquired the GhostStep® Technology from SageGuild LLC\n(“SageGuild”). The GhostStep® Technology has since been rebranded by KWESST as the\nPhantomTM, a tactical multi-function electromagnetic spectrum system. The PhantomTM System can\ngenerate numerous radio signals across multiple bands simultaneously, move itself around the\nbattlefield, and function as a radio-relay while performing its main role of deception.\nThe purchase consideration consisted of:\n(i) USD $100,000 (CAD $134,192) at closing;\n(ii) 140,000 common shares of KWESST at closing; and\n(iii) either the payment of USD $100,000 in cash or the issuance of 557,000 common shares of\nKWESST, at KWESST’s sole discretion, upon the completion of KWESST’s Qualifying\nTransaction (“QT”).\nIn addition, KWESST agreed to:\n(iv) make annual payments (“Yearly Payments”) to SageGuild of $125,000 on each of December\n31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, subject to certain conditions;\n(v) issue 750,000 warrants to SageGuild exercisable at $0.50 per share and expiring on January\n15, 2023 (the “SageGuild Warrants”); and\n11\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\n(vi) pay royalties up to US$20 million.\nThe SageGuild Warrants will vest in equal tranches of 250,000 warrants on each of December 31,\n2020, 2021 and 2022. KWESST has the right to apply the Yearly Payments against the exercise price\nof the Warrants. Further, in the event the consulting agreement with SageGuild is terminated, any\nremaining Yearly Payments will be terminated and the remaining unvested SageGuild Warrants will\nbe forfeited. As the contingent Yearly Payments and SageGuild Warrants are directly linked,\nmanagement combined these as “contingent consideration” for the purchase price allocation noted\nbelow. At December 31, 2020, KWESST issued 250,000 common shares for the 250,000 vested\nwarrants (a non-cash transaction).\nAdditionally, KWESST will pay SageGuild royalties at a rate of 20% on amounts received in\nconsideration of the grant of licenses and on sales of the PhantomTM System up to US$3million.\nThereafter, the royalty rate will decrease to 5%. The obligation to pay royalties will terminate\nautomatically once KWESST has paid SageGuild a total of US$20 million in royalties. The Purchase\nAgreement became effective on June 12, 2020 and will continue in full force and effect until the earliest\nof (i) June 12, 2040 or (ii) the date of the expiration of the last of the patents or any of the patents\n(which are expected to be valid for a period of seventeen years from the date of issuance) related to\nimprovements of the PhantomTM System to which SageGuild, or its principal Mr. Jeffrey M. Dunn,\nmaterially contributes, unless the terminated earlier in accordance with the terms and conditions of the\nagreement.\nIn the event KWESST is in default of payment of any royalty payment as outlined above for a period\nof 30 days, SageGuild may terminate the agreement and KWESST will be required to, among other\nthings, transfer the PhantomTM System back to SageGuild.\nThe purchase price allocation was determined as follows:\nNumber Fair Value\nCash $ 1 34,192\nCommon shares 140,000 $ 33,600\nCash or common share issuance (1) $ 1 33,680\nContingent consideration $ 1 80,000\nTotal $ 481,472\nIdentifiable intangible assets\nTechnology asset $ 481,472\n(1) In September 2020, KWESST elected to issue 557,000 common shares rather than to pay US$100,000. These shares were issued in September 2020 and\naccordingly, these are not included in the total outstanding common shares at June 30, 2020.\nKWESST estimated the fair value as follows:\n• Common shares: as KWESST was a private company at the time, there was no active market\nfor its common shares. Management estimated the fair value of these shares based on the\nUS$100,000 cash or 557,000 common shares election available under the purchase\nagreement, which the two parties negotiated at arm’s length. This implied a fair value of $0.24\nper common share at the time of the closing of the asset acquisition.\n• Contingent consideration: as previously noted above, the contingent consideration (Yearly\nPayments and SageGuild Warrants) is effectively future common share issuances subject to\nthe consulting agreement with SageGuild remaining effective at each anniversary year (the\nservice vesting period). Management assumed the entire 750,000 warrants will be converted\nto common shares over the next three years.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2021, the\noutstanding balance of the CEBA Term Loan was automatically converted to a 2-year interest free\nterm loan. Accordingly, KWESST has presented this loan as non-current in the condensed\nconsolidated interim statements of financial position. The additional CEBA Term loan was initially\nrecorded at fair value, discounted using its incremental borrowing rate of 10%. This resulted in\nrecording a gain on government grant of $3,514 for the six months ended March 31, 2021.\nThe CEBA Term Loan may be repaid at any time without notice or the payment of any penalty. If 75%\nof the CEBA Term Loan is repaid on or before December 31, 2022, the repayment of the remaining\n25% shall be forgiven. If on December 31, 2022, KWESST exercises the option for a 3-year term\nextension, a 5% annual interest will be applied on any balance remaining during the extension period.\nKWESST initially recorded the loan at fair value, without taking into account the potential forgivable\namount. For the nine months ended June 30, 2021, KWESST recognized $3,514 gain on government\ngrant.\nRBC Credit Facility\nKWESST maintains corporate credit cards for its key employees and a foreign exchange line of credit\nwith Royal Bank of Canada (“RBC”). To provide security, KWESST entered into a cash collateral\nagreement for $30,000 and a general security agreement providing a first lien on all assets. The\n$30,000 was invested in a short-term guaranteed investment certificate.\nUnsecured Loan\nOn February 24, 2021, KWESST entered into an unsecured loan agreement with a private fund\nmanaged by a KWESST shareholder to borrow $306,000 for general corporate purposes. The loan is\ndue on demand and bears interest at 0.5% per month. On May 27, 2021, KWESST repaid the loan,\nincluding accrued interest, for a total of $310,527.\n18\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\n13. Lease obligations\nDuring the quarter ended June 2020, KWESST terminated an office lease and entered into a long-\nterm office lease contract. The office lease includes the right to renew for an additional five years\nfollowing its expiry on April 30, 2026. Management has not included the renewal option because it\nwas deemed too uncertain whether KWESST would renew at this time.\nUnder the new office lease, KWESST benefits from the following lease inducements:\n• Free rent from inception (March 1, 2020) to November 1, 2020; and\n• Free rent from November 1, 2021, to March 2022.\nWhen measuring the lease obligation, the Company discounted the remaining lease payments using\nthe incremental borrowing rate of Company of 10% per annum at the time of closing the new lease\nagreement.\nThe following table presents lease obligations for KWESST:\nCurrent Non-current\nOffices Printer Total Portion portion\nBalance, December 31, 2019 $ 1 95,463 $ 7 ,223 $ 2 02,686 $ 85,468 $ 1 17,218\nAddition 3 47,640 - 3 47,640\nTermination ( 157,315) - ( 157,315)\nLease payments (including interest) ( 62,816) ( 7,620) ( 70,436)\nInterest expense 2 9,065 3 97 2 9,462\nBalance, September 30, 2020 (as restated) $ 3 52,037 $ - $ 3 52,037 $ 4 4,128 $ 3 07,909\nLease payments (including interest) ( 54,600) ( 54,600)\nInterest expense 2 5,916 2 5,916\nBalance at June 30, 2021 $ 3 23,353 $ - $ 3 23,353 $ 3 1,494 $ 2 91,859\nRefer to Note 8 regarding the correction of an error.\nThe termination of the former lease resulted in the de-recognition of the lease obligation and related\nunamortized book value of the right-of-use asset, resulting a gain of $17,528.

Each Unit is\ncomprised of one common share of the Company (a \"Common Share\") and one Common Share\npurchase warrant (\"Warrant\"). Each Warrant is exercisable to acquire one Common Share (a \"Warrant\nShare\") at a price of $1.75 per Warrant Share for a period of 24 months from the closing of the Offering.\nIf at any time after four (4) months and one (1) day following the Closing Date, the trading price of the\nShares on the TSX Venture Exchange is equal to or exceeds $3.00 for a period of 10 consecutive\ntrading days, as evidenced by the price at the close of market, KWESST shall be entitled to notify the\nholders of Warrants of its intention to force the exercise of the Warrants. Upon receipt of such notice,\nthe holders of Warrants shall have 30 days to exercise the Warrants, failing which the Warrants will\nautomatically expire. Directors and officers of KWESST purchased 72,000 Units for a total\nconsideration of $90,000.\nManagement has concluded the Unit qualified as an equity instrument under IAS 32, Financial\nInstruments: Presentation. Furthermore, management used the residual method to allocate the $1.25\nconsideration between common shares and warrants. Because the warrants include an accelerator\nprovision for expiration, management used the Barrier option model to estimate the fair value of these\nwarrants, using the following key inputs:\nStrike Price $ 1.75\nStock price $ 1 .01\nVolatility 80%\nDividend Yield Nil\nRisk-free interest rate 0.31%\nBarrier (accelerator on life of warrants) $ 3 .00\nRebate $ 1 .25\nExpected life 2\nWeighted average fair value per warrant $ 0.24\nAccordingly, management has estimated a fair value of $0.24 per warrant. As a result, $1.01 of the\n$1.25 consideration was allocated to common shares.\nThe total cash and non-cash share offering costs were $630,680 for the Offering, which is recorded\nas a reduction of share capital.\n21\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nWarrants\nThe following is a summary of changes in outstanding warrants since September 30, 2020.\nWeighted\naverage\n# of Exercise remaining life\nWarrants Price Fair Value (years) Expiry Date\nWarrants outstanding at September 30, 2020 9,585,050 $ 277,170 3.22\nExercised ( 250,000) $ 0.50 $ (60,000) June 15 2023\nExercised (15,000) $ 0.40 $ (2,265) January 30 2022\nExercised (158,899) $ 0.70 $ (40,726) July 9 2022\nIssued in brokered private placement 3,536,057 $ 1.75 $ 848,654 1.83 April 29 2023\nIssued in LEC asset acquisition 500,000 $ 0.70 $ 425,000 4.83 April 29 2026\nWarrants outstanding at June 30, 2021 13,197,208 $ 0.65 $ 1,447,833 2.43\nWarrants exercisable at June 30, 2021 12,197,208 $ 0.65 2.46\nAs previously noted, management estimated $0.24 for the fair value of the warrants issued in the\nbrokered private placement.\nFor the warrants issued to DEFSEC relating to the LEC System acquisition (Note 4(a)), management\nestimated a fair value of $0.85 per warrant using the Black-Scholes option model with the following\nkey inputs: a) exercise price of $0.70, b) underlying stock price of $1.29, c) estimated volatility of 80%,\nd) risk free interest rate of 0.48%, and e) estimated life of 3 years.\nSee Note 19 for non-cash transaction relating to the exercise of warrants.\nContributed Surplus\nContributed surplus consists of the broker compensation options at fair value, the cumulative\namortized fair value of share-based compensation grants since inception, less amounts transferred to\nshare capital for exercises. If outstanding options expire or are forfeited, there is no reversal of\ncontributed surplus.\nBroker Compensation Options\nThe Offering was completed by PI Financial Corp., the lead agent and sole bookrunner (the\n\"Lead Agent\"), and other dealers (the \"Agents\"). As consideration for the services provided by the\nAgents in connection with the Offering, the Agents received: (a) a cash commission of $288,405; and\n(b) 230,734 compensation options (the “Compensation Options”). Each Compensation Option is\nexercisable to acquire one unit of KWESST (a “Compensation Option Unit”) at a price equal to $1.25\nfor a period of two years after the closing of the Offering. Each Compensation Option Unit is comprised\nof one Common Share and one Common Share purchase warrant (a “Compensation Option Warrant\").\nEach Compensation Option Warrant is exercisable to acquire one Common Share (a \"Compensation\nOption Warrant Share\") at a price of $1.75 per Compensation Option Warrant Share for a period of 24\nmonths from the closing of the Offering.\nBased on the structure of the Compensation Option, management estimated its fair value using the\nMonte Carlo method. Management estimated a fair value of $1.10 per Compensation Option. The\nfollowing were key inputs used in the Monte Carlo simulation: estimated life of 2 years, underlying\nstock price of $1.29, exercise price of Compensation Option of $1.25, exercise price of Compensation\nOption Warrant of $1.75, estimated volatility of 80%, risk free rate of 0.31%, and discount for lack of\nmarketability of 0%.\n22\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nAccordingly, KWESST recorded $169,832 of Compensation Options in contributed surplus, with an\nequal offset to share offering costs (a non-cash transaction).\nShare-Based Compensation\na) Stock Options\nOn March 31, 2021, KWESST shareholders approved the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (the\n“LTIP”), replacing the former Stock Option Plan, to retain a competitive compensation structure for its\ndirectors, executives, employees, consultants, and service providers. The LTIP allows for the issuance\nof stock options (“Options”), restricted share units (“RSUs”), deferred share units (“DSUs”), share\nappreciation rights (“SARs”), and performance stock units (“PSUs”) – collectively referred as\nCompensation Securities. The TSX-V accepted the filing of the LTIP on April 9, 2021.\nUnder the LTIP, the aggregate maximum number of common shares available for issuance from\ntreasury at any given time shall not exceed 10% of the outstanding common shares as of the date of\nCompensation Securities, subject to adjustment or increase of such number pursuant to the terms of\nthe LTIP.

Financial instruments\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe fair values of cash, restricted short-term investment, trade and other receivables, and accounts\npayables and accrued liabilities approximate carrying value because of the short-term nature of these\ninstruments.\nThe carrying value of the borrowings and lease obligations approximate their fair value based on\nmarket rates of interest.\nThe carrying value of the accrued royalties liability is based on estimated fair value, using the income\napproach.\nIn the prior year, KWESST had outstanding convertible notes. In connection with the issuance of the\n2019 Convertible Notes, management determined that the conversion feature was a financial\nderivative liability, requiring fair value remeasurement at each reporting period. Management used the\nBlack-Scholes option model to remeasure the estimated fair value of this financial derivative. This\nresulted in recording an unrealized loss of $89,489 and $64,948 for the three and nine months ended\nJune 30, 2020.\nFinancial risk management\nThe Company is exposed to a number of financial risks arising through the normal course of business\nas well as through its financial instruments. The Company’s overall business strategies, tolerance of\nrisk and general risk management philosophy are determined by the directors in accordance with\nprevailing economic and operating conditions.\n26\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\n(a) Interest rate risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate\nbecause of changes in market interest rates. KWESST’s borrowings have fixed interest rate terms and\ntherefore KWESST is not exposed to interest rate risk.\n(b) Foreign currency risk\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the future cash flows or fair value of the Company’s financial\ninstruments that are denominated in a currency that is not KWESST’s functional currency will fluctuate\ndue to a change in foreign exchange rates.\nHistorically, KWESST’s revenue was substantially denominated in US dollar driven by contracts with\nU.S. prime contractors in the defense sector. Accordingly, KWESST is exposed to fluctuations in the\nUS dollar currency. A significant change in the US dollar currency could have a significant effect on\nKWESST’s financial performance, financial position and cash flows. At this time, KWESST does not\nuse derivative instruments to hedge its US dollar exposure.\nAt June 30, 2021, KWESST had the following net US dollar exposure:\nTotal USD\nNet assets in U.S. subsidiary $ 192,833\nUS denominated:\nAssets $ 283,730\nLiabilities ( 130,025)\nNet US dollar exposure at June 30, 2021 $ 3 46,538\nImpact to profit or loss if 5% movement in the US\ndollar $ 1 7,327\nDuring the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021, KWESST recorded foreign exchange loss of\n$9,025 and $14,189 (2020 – loss of $14,549 and $9,727), respectively.\n(c) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to\nmeet its contractual obligations. KWESST’s credit risk exposure is limited to cash, and trade and other\nreceivables. The counterparty for the trade and other receivables is the Canadian government and a\nU.S. military customer.\n(d) Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that KWESST will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they become\ndue. KWESS’s objective is to ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet its near-term obligation when\nthey become due, under both normal and stressed condition, without incurring unacceptable losses or\nrisking reputational damage to KWESST.\nA key risk in managing liquidity is the degree of uncertainty in KWESST’s cash flows due to its early\nstage in operations. KWESST’s working capital at June 30, 2021 was approximately $2.8 million (refer\nto Note 2(a)).\n27\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\n19.

Commitments and contingencies\nMinimum royalties\nAerialX Drone Solutions (“AerialX”)\nOn April 5, 2021, KWESST entered into an amended and restated licensing agreement with AerialX\nto gain exclusive rights to manufacture, operate, and use its drone for the C-UAS (Counter Unmanned\nAerial Systems) market, specifically for the United States Department of Defense and Canada’s\nDepartment of National Defence for a period of two years from the date upon which AerialX will meet\ncertain technical milestones. In consideration for this exclusivity, KWESST has issued 100,000\ncommon shares to AerialX (“Exclusive License Shares”). Based on KWESST’s closing stock price of\n$1.37 on April 23, 2021 (TSX-V approval date), the fair value for these shares was $137,000. Because\nthere is significant uncertainty over the timing of receiving a functioning prototype from AerialX and the\nrelated future sales to assess recoverability, KWESST recorded the $137,000 fair value as a license\ncost for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, with an equal offset to KWESST’s share capital.\n28\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements\nThree and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)\nIn addition to the Exclusive License Shares, KWESST also agreed to issue an additional 100,000\ncommon shares upon AerialX achieving the technical milestones. For the quarter ended June 30,\n2021, Aerial X has not delivered on the technical milestones and therefore no recognition was made.\nAdditionally, KWESST also agreed to issue up to 300,000 common shares subject to achieving the\nfollowing performance milestones:\n# of Common Shares Milestones\n75,000 $3 million in sales\n100,000 $9 million in sales\n125,000 $18 million in sales\nThe amended and restated licensing agreement also changed the terms of the annual minimum royalty\npayment to AerialX. The initial minimum royalty payment is not due prior to the first anniversary year\nof the Prototype Date, which is defined under the agreement as the date upon which a functioning\nprototype is received by KWESST. Minimum payments will be as follows:\n• 1st anniversary: $150,000\n• 2nd anniversary: $200,000\n• 3rd anniversary: $300,000\n• 4th anniversary: $400,000\n• 5th anniversary: $500,000\nIn accordance with the original agreement dated November 18, 2019, in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020\nKWESST made a payment of $150,000 as an advance for future royalty payments (the “Advance”).\nThis Advance was recorded as a non-current deposit in the audited consolidated statements of\nfinancial position at December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2020. In accordance with IFRS, during\nthe quarter management performed a recoverability review of all KWESST’s financial assets, including\nthis Advance. Management made the recoverability assessment on the Advance based on anticipated\nfuture sales of the licensed technology. While KWESST continues to work with AerialX on this project,\nmanagement has concluded the timing and volume of future sales of the licensed drone was uncertain\nat this stage given AerialX has not yet met the technological milestones. Accordingly, KWESST took\na charge to net loss. This charge was included in the royalty and licensing costs in the condensed\nconsolidated interim statements of net loss and comprehensive loss.\nUnder the amended and restated licensing agreement, KWESST will continue to have non-exclusive\nworldwide license. This agreement will expire on April 30, 2026.\n21.

This MD&A has been prepared\nwith an effective date of August 14, 2024.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the\nthree and nine months ended June 30, 2024 (“Q3 Fiscal 2024 FS”) and the annual audited consolidated financial statements\nand related notes for the year ended September 30, 2023 (“Fiscal 2023 FS”). The financial information presented in this\nMD&A is derived from these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\nThis MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involves risk, uncertainties and assumptions, including statements\nregarding anticipated developments in future financial periods and our future plans and objectives. There can be no assurance\nthat such information will prove to be accurate, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking\nstatements. See “Forward-Looking Statements”.\nAll references to $ or dollar amounts in this MD&A are to Canadian currency unless otherwise indicated.\nAdditional information, including press releases, relating to KWESST is available for view on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nIn this MD&A, we have presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA\nthat has been adjusted for the removal of share-based compensation, foreign exchange loss (gain), change in fair value of\nderivative liabilities, and any one-time, irregular and nonrecurring items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to provide readers with a\nsupplemental measure of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be\napparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management also uses non-IFRS measures, in addition to IFRS\nfinancial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational\ndecision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these\nnon-IFRS financial measures enable us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be hidden by the\neffect of certain expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-IFRS financial measures.\nAccordingly, we believe that these non-IFRS financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for\nmeaningful comparisons and analysis in the business and provides useful information to investors and securities analysts, and\nother interested parties in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing their overall understanding of our\npast performance and future prospects.\nWe caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures do not replace the presentation of our IFRS financial results and\nshould only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. There\nare limitations in the use of non-IFRS measures because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under\nIFRS as well as they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-IFRS financial\nmeasure. Furthermore, other peers may use other non-IFRS measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-\nIFRS measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as tools for\ncomparison.\nGOING CONCERN\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have incurred\nsignificant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities.\nKWESST’s Q3 Fiscal 2024 FS have been prepared on the “going concern” basis which presumes that KWESST will be able\nto realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business is dependent\nupon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products, and the ability to raise additional\n2 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024\ndebt or equity financing, when required.

Q3 and YTD Fiscal 2024\nEBITDA loss was $0.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively, a decrease of 75% and 30%, respectively over the comparable\nprior period mainly due to an increase in revenue and gross profits from our digitization contracts combined with a decrease\nin operating expenses mainly due to a reduction in consulting fees and investor relations costs over the three-month period\nend, and a decrease in share issuance costs over the nine-month period end. The adjustments to EBITDA loss for Q3 and\nYTD Fiscal 2024 included the change in fair value of derivative liabilities. Due to the lower volume of stock-based grants in\nthe last 12 months, compared to same prior period, there is a reduction in stock-based compensation expense in the YTD\nFiscal 2024 period compared to YTD Fiscal 2023. There were share issuance costs in Q3 2024 relating to two US public\nofferings whereas no financing activities occurred in the comparable quarter Fiscal 2023. The lower share issuance costs\nYTD Fiscal 2024 over the comparable prior period is mainly due to the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering in Fiscal 2023 YTD.\nThe decrease in net financing costs YTD Fiscal 2024 over the comparable prior period is due to the costs related to the\nunsecured loans in Fiscal 2023 whereas the loans were repaid, and no such costs were incurred YTD Fiscal 2024.\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased by $0.2 million in the third quarter compared to Q3 Fiscal 2023, mainly due to an additional $0.2\nmillion generated from our digitization business line, offset by a negligible reduction from our non-lethal business line (driven\nfrom the sale of ARWEN products).\nTotal revenue increased by $0.3 million in YTD Fiscal 2024 compared to YTD Fiscal 2023, mainly due to an additional $0.3\nmillion generated from our digitization business line. At the nine-month period ended June 30, 2024, we had sales from our\nnon-lethal business line (driven from the sale of ARWEN products) of $280K, a decrease of $21K from the comparable prior\nperiod.\nWe expect revenue to increase with the commercial launch of KWESST LightningTM which we expect to be early in calendar\n2025, with the expected demand/future orders for the new ARWEN 40mm ammunition and PARA OPS products, as well as\nfrom the recently announced LC4ISR (“Land command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and\nreconnaissance”) subcontract. Management continues to work with our industry partners to determine the outlook for ramp-\nup on the DSEF program. The Company continues to expect no material impact to the overall potential revenue over the life\nof the contract.\nGross Profit\nIn Q3 Fiscal 2024, similar to the same period in Fiscal 2023, the gross profit was negligible. For YTD Fiscal 2024, we earned\n$0.2 million or gross margin of 24.3%, compared to $0.2 million or gross margin of 39.3% in the same period in 2023.\nIn Fiscal 2024, indirect costs associated with the ramp up of the Canadian Government contracts in Q1 resulted in lower gross\nmargin as compared to the same period in 2023. We expect gross profit / margin to continue to increase during Fiscal 2024\nfrom the other product lines described above as well as continued ramp up on the Canadian Government contracts.\nOperating Expenses (“OPEX”)\nTotal OPEX decreased by $0.8 million from the comparable prior period in the three months ended June 30, 2024 due to the\nfollowing factors:\n• S&M decreased by $0.5 million, primarily due to a decrease in investor relations costs and related sales and\nmarketing costs ($0.4 million) in Fiscal 2024 as compared to Fiscal 2023;\n9 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024\n• G&A decreased by $0.3 million, primarily due to a decrease in professional fees and general office expenses, offset\nby an increase in senior management and directors compensation due to market adjustments and additional personnel\nas compared to Fiscal 2023; offset by\n• R&D increased by $0.1 million, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs advancing the KWESST LightningTM\nand BLDS projects in Fiscal 2024.\nTotal OPEX was $7.9 million for YTD Fiscal 2024 compared to $7.8 million in YTD Fiscal 2023, an increase of $ 0.2 million\nover the comparable prior year due to the following factors:\n• R&D increased by $0.8 million, primarily due to the fact that the LEC has reached commercial feasibility, and any\nassociated costs are no longer being capitalized, while it was still in the development stage in Fiscal 2023 ($0.5\nmillion), coupled with an increase in personnel costs advancing the KWESST LightningTM and BLDS projects in\nFiscal 2024 ($0.7 million), offset by a reduction in consulting fees compared to the comparable prior year period\n($0.3 million);\n• G&A increased by $0.4 million, primarily due to the amortization of the LEC intangible in Fiscal 2024 ($0.4\nmillion), an increase in senior management and directors compensation to be in line with market and additional\npersonnel as compared to Fiscal 2023 ($0.3 million), offset by a reduction in consulting & professional fees\ncompared to the comparable prior year period ($0.2 million); offset by\n• S&M decreased by $1.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in investor relations costs and related sales and\nmarketing costs ($1.0 million), and a decrease in business development costs ($0.2 million).\nOther income (expenses), net\nFor Q3 Fiscal 2024, our total other income was $1.0 million, compared to total other expenses of $0.5 million in Q3 Fiscal\n2023. This change in other income (expenses) net is mainly due to the favorable $2.0 million change in fair value of warrant\nliabilities as a result of the remeasurement of the warrant liabilities at June 30, 2024, driven by a decrease in the underlying\ncommon share price on June 30, 2024, offset by a $0.4 million increase in share issuance costs associated with the two US\npublic offering financing activities in Q3 Fiscal 2024.\nFor YTD 2024, our total other income was $2.5 million, compared to total other income of $0.7 million for the same period\n2023 resulting in an increase of $1.8 million. The change in other income (expenses) was driven mainly by:\n• $0.3 million favorable change in fair value of warrant liabilities as a result of the remeasurement of the warrant\nliabilities at June 30, 2024, driven by a decrease in the underlying common share price on June 30, 2024. Under\nIFRS, we are required to remeasure the warrant liabilities at each reporting date until they are exercised or expired;\n• A decrease of $0.9 million in Share Offering Costs as $1.3 million related to the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering in\nFiscal 2023, compared to $0.4 million associated with the two US public offering financing activities in April and\nJune 2024;\n• $0.5 million decrease in net finance costs is primarily due to the Fiscal 2023 recognition of the remaining\nunamortized accretion costs and interest expense relating to the repayment of all outstanding loans, following the\nclosing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering; and\n• $0.2 million increase in foreign exchange gain due to appreciation in the U.S. currency during the period.\n10 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\nThe following tables summarize selected results for the eight most recent completed quarters to June 30, 2024 (unaudited):\n2024 2023 2022\n($ in thousands) Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4\nRevenue 3 29 486 129 606 150 161 317 255\nNet loss ( 1,162) ( 3,540) ( 399) ( 2,419) ( 3,452) ( 1,227) ( 2,208) ( 2,345)\nNote: due to preparing the table in thousands, there may be rounding differences.\nQuarterly Results Trend Analysis\nThere is no material change to our quarterly results trend from our disclosure in our annual MD&A dated January 17, 2024,\nexcept that we expect further volatility with our quarterly revenue during Fiscal 2024 due to uncertain magnitude and timeline\nof ramp up on our military government contracts as well as ramp of revenue for new Arwen and PARA OPS products.\nAdditionally, we expect further volatility with our quarterly net loss due to the remeasurement of warrant liabilities at each\nreporting period, with the change in fair value recorded through P&L.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe following table summarizes our financial position:\nJune 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\nAssets\nCurrent $ 2 ,670,123 $ 6 ,842,074\nNon-current 4 ,071,537 4 ,916,758\nTotal assets $ 6,741,660 $ 1 1,758,832\nLiabilities\nCurrent $ 2,325,864 $ 6 ,383,635\nNon-current 1 ,269,121 1 ,439,577\nTotal liabilities 3 ,594,985 7 ,823,212\nNet assets $ 3,146,675 $ 3 ,935,620\nWorking capital (1) $ 344,259 $ 4 58,439\n(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.\nOur working capital was $0.3 million at June 30, 2024, a $0.1 million decrease from September 30, 2023. The decrease was\nprimarily due to the net operating loss for YTD Fiscal 2024, offset by proceeds from two financing activities in the current\nquarter of Fiscal 2024. Current liabilities include warrant liabilities, a non-cash liability item (see Note 10 of the Q3 Fiscal\n2024 financial statements). Excluding warrant liabilities, we would have working capital of $0.6 million. These warrant\nliabilities will be extinguished when the warrants are exercised or expired.

There is no assurance that any warrants will be exercised.\n11 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024\nTotal assets decreased by $5.0 million from September 30, 2023, mainly due to a decrease in cash of $4.2 million and a\ndecrease in the unamortized value of non-current assets of $0.8 million.\nTotal liabilities decreased by $4.2 million from September 30, 2023, mainly due a decrease in the warrant liabilities of $4.0\nmillion, a $0.1 million decrease in trade payables and accrued liabilities due to the timing of payments to suppliers, and a\n$0.1 million decrease in existing lease obligations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAvailable Liquidity\nOur approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we always have sufficient liquidity to meet our\nliabilities as they come due. We regularly perform cash flow forecasts to ensure that we have sufficient cash to meet our\noperational needs while maintaining sufficient liquidity. At this time, we do not use any derivative financial instruments to\nhedge our currency risk.\nOn December 9, 2022, we closed both the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering pursuant to which we received aggregate gross\nproceeds of USD$14.1 million (or CAD$19.4 million), before underwriting and offering costs (refer to the annual MD&A\ndated January 17, 2024 for further details including our expected use of proceeds). On July 21, 2023, we closed the Private\nPlacement pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds of USD$5.59 million (or CAD$7.4 million), before\nunderwriting and offering costs (refer to the annual MD&A dated January 17, 2024 for further details including our expected\nuse of proceeds). On April 9, 2024, we closed a US Public Offering pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds\nof USD$1.0 million (or CAD$1.4 million), before underwriting and offering costs. On June 14, 2024, we closed a US Public\nOffering pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds of USD$1.7 million (or CAD$2.3 million), before\nunderwriting and offering costs\nAt June 30, 2024, our cash position was $1.2 million, a decrease of $4.2 million since September 30, 2023 primarily due to\ncash used in operations of $6.9 million, offset by net proceeds of $2.6 million from two US Public Offering financing activities\nin April 2024 and June 2024, respectively.\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our other products and have incurred\nsignificant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business\nis dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products, and the ability to raise\nadditional debt or equity financing, when required. There are various risks and uncertainties affecting our future financial\nposition and our performance. However, we may require additional capital in the event we fail to implement our business\nplan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or financial performance. There is no\nassurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required in the future. Potential sources of capital may\ninclude additional equity and/or debt financings. In our view, the availability of capital will be affected by, among other\nthings, capital market conditions, the success of our PARA OPS system commercialization efforts, timing for winning new\ncustomer contracts, potential acquisitions, and other relevant considerations (see Risk Factors). In the event we raise\nadditional funds by issuing equity securities, our existing shareholders will likely experience dilution, and any additional\nincurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operational and\nfinancial covenants that could further restrict our operations. Any failure to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or\nat all may require us to significantly change or curtail our current or planned operations in order to conserve cash until such\ntime, if ever, that sufficient proceeds from operations are generated, and could result in us not being in a position to advance\nour commercialization strategy or take advantage of business opportunities.\n12 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the respective periods:\nNine months ended June 30,\n2024 2023\nCash inflows (outflows) by activity:\nOperting activities $ (6,876,278) $ ( 11,346,319)\nInvesting activities (95,285) (990,463)\nFinancing acitivities 2 ,743,433 1 3,925,926\nNet cash inflows (outflows) $ (4,228,130) $ 1 ,589,143\nCash, beginning of period 5 ,407,009 170,545\nCash, end of period $ 1,178,879 $ 1,759,688\nCash used by operating activities\nCash flow used in operating activities decreased by $4.5 million to $6.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024\nprimarily due to payments on overdue payables as well as unpaid voluntary deferred wages, consulting fees, and bonuses in\nFiscal 2023 after the close of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering in December 2022, coupled with significant prepaid\nexpenses during the nine months ended June 30, 2023 including retention bonus for our general manager of PARA OPS\n(refundable in the event he voluntarily terminates prior to a specified date as set by us), compared to regular operating\nactivities in Fiscal 2024, with no significant transactions.\nCash used by investing activities\nCash flow used in investing activities decreased by $0.9 million to $0.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024\nmainly due to the Fiscal 2023 additional investment in the product development of our PARA OPS, coupled with additional\nlow-rate initial production equipment for PARA OPS, whereas there were no significant investments in equipment in Fiscal\n2024.\nCash (used) provided by financing activities\nCash flow used by financing activities was less than $2.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 mainly from the\nnet proceeds received from two US Public Offering financing activities in Fiscal 2024, compared to cash flow provided by\nfinancing activities of $13.9 million in Fiscal 2023 primarily due to net proceeds generated from the U.S. IPO and Canadian\nOffering, partially offset by repayment of all outstanding borrowings during the Fiscal 2023 period to date.\nCapital Resources\nOur objective in managing our capital is to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern and to sustain future\ndevelopment of the business. Our senior management is responsible for managing the capital through regular review of\nfinancial information to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet operating requirements and investments to support\nits growth strategy. Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing this process. From time to time, we could issue new\ncommon shares or debt to maintain or adjust our capital structure. We are not subject to any externally imposed capital\nrequirements.\nOur primary sources of capital to date have been borrowings, security offerings, exercise of stock options and warrants, and,\nto a lesser extent, pre-commercial revenue.

In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2.5 million units at a public offering price of US$4.13 per unit (the\n“Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock (“Warrant”). The\nWarrants have a per share exercise price of US$5.00, can be exercised immediately, and expire five years from the date of\nissuance. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option to\npurchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share purchase warrants and 375,000 warrants to purchase Common\nShares. All these warrants will expire on December 8, 2027.\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one Common Share and one warrant to purchase one\nCommon Share, at a price to the public of US$4.13 per unit. The warrants will have a per Common Share exercise price of\nUS$5.00, are exercisable immediately and expire five years from the date of issuance.\nThe closing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of US$14.1 million (CAD $19.4\nmillion). After underwriting discounts and offering expenses, the net proceeds were US$11.2 million (CAD $15.2 million).\nSee Note 11(a) of Q3 Fiscal 2024 FS for further details.\nFor the estimated use of proceeds from the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, refer to our annual MD&A for Fiscal 2023 dated\nJanuary 17, 2024.\nShares for Debt Settlement – December 2022\nOn December 13, 2022, we issued 56,141 Units to settle $12,000 of the March 2022 loans and USD$223,321 of the August\n2022 loans, including unpaid accrued interest and 10% premium at maturity. See Note 11(a) of the Q3 Fiscal 2024 financial\nstatements for further details.\nPrivate Placement – July 2023\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed a brokered private placement, resulting in the issuance of 1,542,194 common shares of KWESST,\nfor aggregate gross proceeds of USD$5,588,397 (approximately CAD$7.4M) (the “July 2023 Offering”).\nAs a part of the July 2023 Offering, the Company issued 1,542,194 common shares at a price of US$2.26 (CAD$2.98) per\ncommon share (each a \"Common Share\") and 930,548 pre-funded warrants at a price of US$2.259 (CAD$2.979) per pre-\nfunded warrant (each a \"Pre-funded Warrant\"), with each Common Share and Pre-funded Warrant being bundled with one\ncommon share purchase warrant of the Company (each a \"Common Warrant\"). Each Pre-Funded Warrant entitles the holder\nto acquire one Common Share at an exercise price of US$0.001 per Common Share, and each Common Warrant is\nimmediately exercisable and entitles the holder to acquire one Common Share at an exercise price of US$2.66 (CAD$3.50)\nper Common Share for a period of 60 months following the closing of the July 2023 Offering. Although the Common Shares\nand Pre-funded Warrants are each bundled with a Common Warrant, each security is issued separately. See Note 11(a) of Q3\nFiscal 2024 FS for further details.\nShares for Debt Settlement – January 2024\nOn January 10, 2024, we issued 46,709 common shares in a settlement of debt in an amount of approximately $97,615.

The trial has been initially rolled out to a team within the Tactical unit\nof the Agency to stress-test the equipment and services provide valuable user feedback that will shape the full commercial\nversion once released, and as part of the trial, KWESST will provide training and support to obtain maximum user\nengagement. During the three-month trial period, the Agency will have access to the full capability of command,\ncommunication, and critical-incident management through the KWESST Lighting™ interface on all Android-based devices\nand leverage peer-to-peer and cloud-based secure networked tactical video streams across KWESST's secure SaaS (“Service\nas a Software”) cloud service.\nOn August 12, 2024, the Company announced that it has entered into definitive agreements for the purchase and sale of\n4,715,000 common shares at a purchase price of US$0.20 per common share in a registered direct offering. The gross proceeds\nto the Company from the offering were approximately US$943,000 before deducting placement agent fees and other offering\nexpenses payable by the Company.

In connection with the closing, the Company will pay a cash fee\nequal to 7.5% of the aggregate gross proceeds raised the placement agent as well as issue warrants to purchase up to an\naggregate of 353,625 common shares (equal to 7.5% of common shares issued) at an exercise price of $0.25 per share, which\nwarrants are exercisable upon issuance and have a termination date of August 9, 2029. The registered direct offering was\nclosed on August 13, 2024.\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nAs required by National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers Annual and Interim Filings and Rule 13a-\n15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, we have evaluated, under the supervision\nand with the participation of our management, including out Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the design\nof our disclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)\nas of the end of the quarter. These DC&P are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be\npublicly disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis.\nBased upon the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) have concluded that\nour disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level due to the\nmaterial weaknesses described below under “Management’s Assessment on Internal controls over Financial Reporting”. As\na result of the material weaknesses identified, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures.\nNotwithstanding these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at June 30, 2024 in conformance with IFRS.\nManagement’s Assessment on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nIn accordance with National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuer’s Annual and Interim Filings and as\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, management is\nresponsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”), The Company’s\nmanagement, including the CEO and CFO, and designed ICFR based on the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO Framework”) to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with IFRS.\nInternal Controls over Financial Reporting (“ICFR”)\nICFR is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ICFR has inherent\nlimitations. ICFR is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgement and\nbreakdowns resulting from human failures. ICFR also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.\nBecause of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by\nICFR. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to\ndesign into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nAs at June 30, 2024, management assessed the design of our ICFR and concluded that our ICFR includes material weaknesses,\ndescribed below. These material weaknesses create a reasonable possibility that material misstatements in interim or annual\nfinancial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. To compensate for this material weakness,\nmanagement continues to perform additional account reconciliations and other analytical and substantive procedures to ensure\nreliable financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The material weakness will\nnot be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has\nconcluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nManagement, under the supervision, and with the participation, of our CEO and CFO and oversight of the Board of Directors,\nevaluated the effectiveness of our ICFR as at September 30, 2023 and evaluated the design at June 30, 2024 against the COSO\n17 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024\nFramework. Based on these evaluations, Management concluded that material weaknesses existed as of June 30, 2024, as\ndescribed below, and due to these material weaknesses, ICFR is not effective as of June 30, 2024.\nIneffective control environment: The Company did not have an effective control environment due to the lack of a\nsufficient complement of fully trained personnel in financial reporting, accounting and IT with assigned\nresponsibility and accountability related to ICFR. This material weakness contributed to the other material\nweaknesses below.\nSpreadsheet Controls: The Company did not implement and maintain effective controls surrounding certain\nspreadsheets. Spreadsheets are inherently prone to error due to the manual nature, which increases the risk of human\nerror. The Company’s controls related to complex spreadsheets did not address all identified risks associated with\nmanual data entry, review of inputs into management assumptions and estimates, completeness of data entry, and\nthe accuracy of mathematical formulas, impacting complex spreadsheets used in revenue, inventory, impairment\nand financial closing processes.\nIT General Controls: The Company had an aggregation of deficiencies within its IT general controls across multiple\nsystems, including deficiencies related to segregation of duties, user access and change management. As a result,\nthe Company concluded that its process-level automated and manual controls in the areas of journal entries and\nfinancial reporting that are dependent on IT general controls, information, and data derived from affected IT systems\nwere also ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.\nManagement Review Controls: The Company did not consistently have documented evidence of management\nreview controls and did not always maintain segregation of duties between preparing and reviewing analyses and\nreconciliations with respect to revenue, inventory, purchasing, and financial closing.\nChanges to Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nIn fiscal 2023 and Q3 2024 to date, the Company underwent a series of changes that materially affected areas reasonably\nlikely to continue to materially affect the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”). Management has\ncontinued efforts to develop and enhance the performance of ICFR. The addition of additional qualified finance and HR staff\nas well as the appointment of its CFO and CEO who are both experienced and qualified CPAs, will have a positive effect on\nthe Company’s ability to remediate its internal control deficiencies.\nRemediation Plan\nLate in the second half of fiscal year 2023, and subsequent to the fiscal year-end 2023, the Company strengthened its ability\nto remediate the above noted material weaknesses with the addition of:\n- Additional qualified finance and HR staff;\n- Addition of qualified CPAs in both the CFO and CEO roles;\n- Engagement of an external IT consultant and reorganizing accountability for IT general controls within the Company’s\nmanagement team with a qualified internal leader.\nThese measures have made improvements to the deficiencies that aggregate to form the material weaknesses identified above.\nManagement, with oversight from the Audit Committee will continue to implement remediation measures related to the\nidentified material weaknesses with a focus on enhancing business processes and controls as the Company continues to\nmature. Management will additionally:\n- Review its IT strategy and investigating ways to improve key software applications.\n- Review key business processes and controls to determine where further system reliance can potentially mitigate the use\nof complex spreadsheets, improve segregation of duties, and reduce reliance on manual management review controls.\n18 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024\n- Improve control tools and templates to aide with the sufficient and consistent documentation of review controls and\nprocedures.\nWe believe these measures, and others that may be implemented, will remediate the material weaknesses in ICFR described\nabove.\n19 | P age"

This MD&A has been prepared\nwith an effective date of May 14, 2024.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the\nthree and six months ended March 31, 2024 (“Q2 Fiscal 2024 FS”) and the annual audited consolidated financial statements\nand related notes for the year ended September 30, 2023 (“Fiscal 2023 FS”). The financial information presented in this\nMD&A is derived from these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\nThis MD&A contains forward-looking statements involves risk, uncertainties and assumptions, including statements\nregarding anticipated developments in future financial periods and our future plans and objectives. There can be no assurance\nthat such information will prove to be accurate, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking\nstatements. See “Forward-Looking Statements”.\nAll references to $ or dollar amounts in this MD&A are to Canadian currency unless otherwise indicated.\nAdditional information, including press releases, relating to KWESST is available for view on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nIn this MD&A, we have presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA\nthat has been adjusted for the removal of share-based compensation, foreign exchange loss (gain), change in fair value of\nderivative liabilities, and any one-time, irregular and nonrecurring items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to provide readers with a\nsupplemental measure of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be\napparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management also uses non-IFRS measures, in addition to IFRS\nfinancial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational\ndecision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these\nnon-IFRS financial measures enable us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be hidden by the\neffect of certain expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-IFRS financial measures.\nAccordingly, we believe that these non-IFRS financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for\nmeaningful comparisons and analysis in the business and provides useful information to investors and securities analysts, and\nother interested parties in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing their overall understanding of our\npast performance and future prospects.\nWe caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures do not replace the presentation of our IFRS financial results and\nshould only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. There\nare limitations in the use of non-IFRS measures because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under\nIFRS as well as they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-IFRS financial\nmeasure. Furthermore, other peers may use other non-IFRS measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-\nIFRS measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as tools for\ncomparison.\nGOING CONCERN\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have incurred\nsignificant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities.\nKWESST’s Q2 Fiscal 2024 FS have been prepared on the “going concern” basis which presumes that KWESST will be able\nto realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business is dependent\nupon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products, and the ability to raise additional\n2 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\ndebt or equity financing, when required.

Our\nregistered office is located at 550 Burrard Street, Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and our corporate office\nis located at Unit 1, 155 Terrence Matthews Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We have representative offices in the\nfollowing foreign locations: Washington DC (United States), London (United Kingdom), and Abu Dhabi (United Arab\nEmirates).\nKWESST Micro Systems Inc. is an early-stage technology company that develops and commercializes next-generation\ntactical systems for military and security forces and public safety markets.\nOur product development has focused on three niche market segments as follows:\nOur core mission is to protect and save lives. At Fiscal Year-End 2023, we began to group our offerings for\ncommercialization purposes into Military and Public Safety missions, as shown on our web site at www.kwesst.com\nKWESST’s Military offerings are comprised of:\n5 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\n Digitization: real-time data sharing at the tactical level, including integration with Battlefield Management\nApplications (BMS) including ATAK and TAK.\n Digitized firing platforms (“Digital Fires” or “Joint Fires”).\n Battlefield Laser Detection Systems (“BLDS”).\n Digitized Electro Magnetic Spectrum Operations (“EMSO”).\nKWESST’s Public Safety offerings are comprised of:\n KWESST Lightning: leverages the Company’s military digitization technology to provide responders to any type\nof incident with instant onboarding to the mission and TAK-enabled real-time situational awareness software as a\nservice (SaaS).\n Non-Lethal Munitions Systems\nPARA OPSTM, a next-generation non-lethal system just being introduced to market now.\no\nARWENTM 37mm system, plus a new 40mm munition.\no\nStrategy\nOur strategy is to pursue and win large defense contracts for multi-year revenue visibility with prime defense contractors for\nnext-generation situational awareness, with a particular focus on ATAK applications that can be leveraged to address similar\nrequirements in the Public Safety Market complemented by our proprietary ARWEN and PARA OPSTM non-lethal products,\nwhere it is possible to drive sales and where the sales cycle is typically shorter than the more programmatic defense market.\nMajor Highlights – Quarter ended March 31, 2024 (“Q2 Fiscal 2024”)\nThe following is a summary of the major highlights that occurred during the quarter ended Q2 Fiscal 2024:\n• On February 2, we announced that Dave Ibbetson, former General Manager of General Dynamics C4 Systems\nInternational, and General Dynamics Mission Systems International (“GDMS”) has been engaged as a Strategic\nDefence Advisor.\n• On February 5, we announced highlights from the Company’s attendance at SHOT Show 2024. This included\nmany law enforcement agencies at the federal, state and local level, plus foreign distributors from Europe, Asia,\nLatin America and the Middle East, specifically seeking out the Company to view the new products. The Company\nhas started receiving initial small quantity orders for test and evaluation of its 40mm baton ammunition as well as\nrequests from various agencies for live demonstrations of the PARA OPSTM products.\n• On February 12, we announced that we were invited to demonstrate and brief on our public safety products at an\ninternational gathering of special intervention units, which was held overseas in April 2024. We have also been\ndemonstrating and briefing on our new PARA OPS non-lethal system, our new 40mm ARWEN cartridge for riot\ncontrol and tactical teams and our new Lightning and T-SAS systems for sharing situational awareness among\nresponders and commanders to various police agencies in North America.\n6 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\n• On February 28, we announced the signing of a binding letter of intent with O’Dell Engineering Ltd., in\nSouthwestern Ontario, Canada, for the sale and distribution of PARA OPS products in Canada for the civilian\nmarket.\n• On March 8, we announced that the Company has been awarded a contract by the Ontario Provincial Police (\"OPP\")\nto deliver training and certification to the force's lead Team Awareness Kit (TAK) users and trainers.\n• On March 12, we reported on the Company’s demonstrations of PARA OPSTM to Southern California law\nenforcement agencies at their request following demonstrations at SHOT Show 2024 in Las Vegas in January.\nThe following is a summary of major highlights that occurred since Q2 Fiscal 2024:\n• On April 3, we announced that the Company intends to offer to sell common shares (and/or pre-funded warrants\n(\"Pre-funded Warrants\") in lieu thereof) in an underwritten United States public offering.\n• On April 4, we announced the pricing of its underwritten public offering of 1,538,500 common shares (or pre-\nfunded warrants (\"Pre-funded Warrants\") in lieu thereof) at a public offering price of $0.65 per share, for gross\nproceeds of approximately $1,000,000, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering\nexpenses.\n• On April 9, we announced the closing of the previously announced underwritten public offering of 735,000 common\nshares and 803,500 pre-funded warrants with an exercise price of $0.001 (\"Pre-funded Warrants\") at a public offering\nprice of US$0.65 per share and US$0.649 per Pre-funded Warrant, less the underwriting discount.\n• On April 30, we provided a corporate update ahead of our fiscal Q2 result, highlighting status of our military\ndigitization contracts through 2028, an MOU signed with the University of Ottawa to hire software coding graduates,\nwork with a large Canadian police agency as first adopter of KWESST LightningTM in advance of full market release,\nARWEN scaling to multiples of historical revenue and, major agencies continue evaluations of PARA OPS.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following selected financial data has been extracted from Q2 Fiscal 2024 FS.\n7 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nThree months ended March 31, Six months ended March 31, Change\n2024 2023 2024 2023 %\nRevenue $ 485,864 $ 1 61,403 $ 614,932 $ 4 78,736 28%\nCost of sales (243,681) (128,634) (426,554) (268,218) 59%\nGross profit 242,183 32,769 188,378 210,518 -11%\nGross margin % 49.8% 20.3% 30.6% 44.0%\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") 2,044,489 1,665,971 3,377,489 2,644,458 28%\nSelling and marketing (\"S&M\") 418,027 1,152,916 914,622 1,607,103 -43%\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") 724,485 306,680 1,349,325 569,509 137%\nTotal operating expenses 3,187,001 3,125,567 5,641,436 4,821,070 17%\nOperating loss (2,944,818) (3,092,798) (5,453,058) (4,610,552) 18%\nOther expenses\nShare issuance costs - 57,548 - (1,309,545) N/A\nNet finance costs (61,658) (11,107) (74,855) (554,684) -87%\nForeign exchange gain (loss) (805) (19,684) 90,905 (150,040) -161%\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities (532,922) 1,838,972 1,497,832 3,189,395 -53%\nTotal other expenses, net (595,385) 1,865,729 1,513,882 1,175,126 29%\nNet loss $ (3,540,203) $ ( 1,227,069) $ (3,939,176) $ ( 3,435,426) 15%\nEBITDA loss (1) $ (3,158,891) $ ( 978,395) $ (3,223,246) $ ( 2,556,864) 26%\nAdjusted EBITDA loss(1) $ (2,466,567) $ ( 2,703,250) $ (4,589,897) $ ( 4,009,627) 14%\nLoss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.61) $ (0.29) $ (0.69) $ (1.17) -41%\nWeighted average common shares - basic 5,823,662 4,271,594 5,719,657 2,925,729 95%\n(1) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measures.

Q2 and YTD Fiscal 2024\nadjusted EBITDA loss was $2.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively, a decrease of 9% and increase of 14%, respectively\nover the comparable prior period mainly due to increased operating expenses driven by increased research and development\ncosts, personnel costs, and professional fees, offset by an increase in revenue from our digitization contracts as well as a\nreduction in investor relations costs and marketing related travel and conference costs compared to the prior periods. The\n8 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nadjustments to EBITDA loss for Q2 and YTD Fiscal 2024 included the change in fair value of derivative liabilities. Due to\nthe lower volume of stock-based grants in the last 12 months, compared to same prior period, this has resulted in a reduction\nin stock-based compensation expense in the current quarter and YTD compared to Q2 Fiscal 2023. The higher net finance\ncosts and share issuance costs for Q2 2024 over the comparable prior period is due to increased lease obligations and the\nsettlement of prior period related share issuance costs. The lower net finance costs and share issuance costs YTD Fiscal 2024\nover the comparable prior period is mainly due to the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering in Fiscal 2023 year-to-date.\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased by $0.3 million in the second quarter compared to Q2 Fiscal 2023, mainly due to an additional $0.2\nmillion generated from our digitization business line and $0.1 million from our non-lethal business line (driven from the sale\nof ARWEN products). Sales of ARWEN products for Q2 Fiscal 2024 were $205K, just shy of the anticipated $226K sales\npreviously announced in our March 21, 2024 press release, as we worked through the backlog of orders.\nTotal revenue increased by $0.1 million in YTD Fiscal 2024 compared to YTD Fiscal 2023, mainly due to an additional $0.1\nmillion generated from our digitization business line. At the six-month period ended March 31, 2024, we had sales from our\nnon-lethal business line (driven from the sale of ARWEN products) of $240K, an increase of $27K from the same prior\nperiod.\nWe expect revenue to increase with the launch of KWESST LightningTM. We also expect revenue to increase from expected\ndemand/future orders for the new ARWEN 40mm ammunition and PARA OPS products. With respect to our DSEF contract,\nit was announced in Q2 2024 that the Canadian Government contracts have suspended the acceptance of new submissions of\nemployees, potentially delaying the onboard of three of the seven candidates already submitted and deferring acceptance of\nsubmissions for the remaining four candidates. KWESST is working with its JV partners and DND customer to address\nquestions related to the recent announcement to assess and mitigate the impact this may have on short-term business\noutcomes. The Company does not yet know the impact to its overall potential revenue over the remaining life of the contract.\nGross Profit\nIn Q2 Fiscal 2024, the gross profit was $0.2 million, compared to a negligible amount in the same period in 2023. For YTD\nFiscal 2024, we earned $0.2 million or gross margin of 30%, compared to $0.2 million or gross margin of 44% in the same\nperiod in 2023.\nIn Fiscal 2024, indirect costs associated with the ramp up of the Canadian Government contracts in Q1 resulted in lower gross\nmargin as compared to the same period in 2023. We expect gross profit / margin to continue to increase during Fiscal 2024\nfrom the other product lines described above.\nOperating Expenses (“OPEX”)\nTotal OPEX remained consistent with the comparable prior period in the three months ended March 31, 2024, though\nincreased G&A and research and development costs were offset by a decrease of sales and marketing costs in Q2 Fiscal 2024\nas compared to the same period in 2023, primarily for the same reasons as noted below in the YTD 2024 comparison.\nTotal OPEX was $5.6 million for YTD Fiscal 2024 compared to $4.8 million in YTD Fiscal 2023, an increase of $ 0.8 million\nover the comparable prior year due to the following factors:\n• G&A increased by $0.7 million, primarily due to the amortization of the LEC intangible in Fiscal 2024 ($0.5\nmillion), an increase in senior management and directors compensation to be in line with market and additional\npersonnel as compared to Fiscal 2023 ($0.1 million), as well as an increase in legal fees, offset by a decrease in audit\nfees for a net increase in professional fees as compared to Fiscal 2023 ($0.1 million).\n9 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\n• S&M decreased by $0.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in investor relations costs and related sales and\nmarketing costs ($0.9 million), a decrease in business development costs ($0.3 million), offset by an increase in\nconsulting fees ($0.3 million) and personnel costs ($0.2 million) in Fiscal 2024 as compared to Fiscal 2023.\n• R&D increased by $0.8 million, primarily due to the fact that the LEC has reached commercial feasibility, and any\nassociated costs are no longer being capitalized, while it was still in the development stage in Fiscal 2023 ($0.5\nmillion), coupled with R&D costs related to the advancement of the BLDS project in Fiscal 2024, whereas it was in\nthe development stage in Fiscal 2023 ($0.1 million), and increase in personnel costs in Fiscal 2024 compared to the\nsame prior period ($0.1 million).\nOther income (expenses), net\nFor Q2 Fiscal 2024, our total other expense was $0.6 million, compared to total other income of $1.9 million in Q2 Fiscal\n2023. This change in other income (expenses) net is mainly due to the same reason noted below for YTD Fiscal 2024.\nFor YTD 2024, our total other income was $1.5 million, compared to total other income of $1.2 million for the same period\n2023. The change in other income (expenses) was driven mainly by:\n• $1.3 million in Share Offering Costs related to the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering in Fiscal 2023, whereas there\nwere no such offerings in Fiscal 2024;\n• $0.5 million decrease in net finance costs is primarily due to the Fiscal 2023 recognition of the remaining\nunamortized accretion costs and interest expense relating to the repayment of all outstanding loans, following the\nclosing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering;\n• $0.2 million increase in foreign exchange gain due to appreciation in the U.S. currency during the period; offset by\n• $1.7 million unfavorable change in fair value of warrant liabilities as a result of the remeasurement of the warrant\nliabilities at March 31, 2024, driven by a decrease in the underlying common share price on March 31, 2024. Under\nIFRS, we are required to remeasure the warrant liabilities at each reporting date until they are exercised or expired.\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\nThe following tables summarize selected results for the eight most recent completed quarters to March 31, 20224 (unaudited):\n2024 2023 2022\n($ in thousands) Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3\nRevenue 4 86 1 29 6 06 1 50 1 61 3 17 2 55 2 82\nNet loss ( 3,540) ( 399) ( 2,419) ( 3,452) ( 1,227) ( 2,208) ( 2,345) ( 2,600)\nNote: due to preparing the table in thousands, there may be rounding differences.\nQuarterly Results Trend Analysis\nThere is no material change to our quarterly results trend from our disclosure in our annual MD&A dated January 17, 2024,\nexcept that we expect further volatility with our quarterly revenue during Fiscal 2024 due to the suspension of new candidate\nsubmissions with our ongoing DSEF contract, as well as ramp up of new military contracts as we launch PARA OPS.\nAdditionally, we expect further volatility with our quarterly net loss due to the remeasurement of warrant liabilities at each\nreporting period, with the change in fair value recorded through P&L.\n10 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe following table summarizes our financial position:\nMarch 31, September 30,\n2024 2023\nAssets\nCurrent $ 2,170,243 $ 6 ,842,074\nNon-current 4 ,346,421 4 ,916,758\nTotal assets $ 6,516,664 $ 1 1,758,832\nLiabilities\nCurrent $ 4,348,793 $ 6 ,383,635\nNon-current 1 ,455,492 1 ,439,577\nTotal liabilities 5 ,804,285 7 ,823,212\nNet assets $ 712,379 $ 3 ,935,620\nWorking capital (1) $ (2,178,550) $ 4 58,439\n(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.\nOur working capital was negative $2.2 million at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $2.6 million from September 30, 2023. The\ndecrease was primarily due to the net operating loss for YTD Fiscal 2024. Current liabilities include warrant liabilities, a non-\ncash liability item (see Note 10 of the Q2 Fiscal 2024 financial statements). Excluding warrant liabilities, we would have\npositive working capital. These warrant liabilities will be extinguished when the warrants are exercised or expired. If\nexercised, the proceeds will provide us with additional capital to fund our future working capital requirements. There is no\nassurance that any warrants will be exercised.\nTotal assets decreased by $5.2 million from September 30, 2023, mainly due to a decrease in cash of $5.1 million and a\ndecrease in the unamortized value of non-current assets of $0.5 million.\nTotal liabilities decreased by $2 million from September 30, 2023, mainly due a decrease in the warrant liabilities of $2.1\nmillion, offset by an increase in trade payables and accrued liabilities of $0.1 million due to the timing of payments to\nsuppliers.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAvailable Liquidity\nOur approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we always have sufficient liquidity to meet our\nliabilities as they come due. We regularly perform cash flow forecasts to ensure that we have sufficient cash to meet our\noperational needs while maintaining sufficient liquidity. At this time, we do not use any derivative financial instruments to\nhedge our currency risk.\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed the Private Placement pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds of USD$5.59\nmillion (or CAD$7.4 million), before underwriting and offering costs (refer to the annual MD&A dated January 17, 2024 for\nfurther details including our expected use of proceeds). On December 9, 2022, we closed both the U.S. IPO and Canadian\nOffering pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds of USD$14.1 million (or CAD$19.4 million), before\n11 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nunderwriting and offering costs (refer to the annual MD&A dated January 17, 2024 for further details including our expected\nuse of proceeds).\nAt March 31, 2024, our cash position was $0.2 million, a decrease of $5.1 million since September 30, 2023 primarily due to\ncash used in operations of $5 million.\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our other products and have incurred\nsignificant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business\nis dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products, and the ability to raise\nadditional debt or equity financing, when required. There are various risks and uncertainties affecting our future financial\nposition and our performance. However, we may require additional capital in the event we fail to implement our business\nplan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or financial performance. There is no\nassurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required in the future. Potential sources of capital may\ninclude additional equity and/or debt financings. In our view, the availability of capital will be affected by, among other\nthings, capital market conditions, the success of our PARA OPS system commercialization efforts, timing for winning new\ncustomer contracts, potential acquisitions, and other relevant considerations (see Risk Factors). In the event we raise\nadditional funds by issuing equity securities, our existing shareholders will likely experience dilution, and any additional\nincurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operational and\nfinancial covenants that could further restrict our operations. Any failure to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or\nat all may require us to significantly change or curtail our current or planned operations in order to conserve cash until such\ntime, if ever, that sufficient proceeds from operations are generated, and could result in us not being in a position to advance\nour commercialization strategy or take advantage of business opportunities.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the respective periods:\nSix months ended March 31,\n2024 2023\nCash inflows (outflows) by activity:\nOperting activities $ (4,979,109) $ ( 9,155,294)\nInvesting activities ( 69,407) ( 883,852)\nFinancing acitivities ( 94,759) 13,852,292\nNet cash inflows (outflows) $ (5,143,275) $ 3 ,813,146\nCash, beginning of period 5,407,009 170,545\nCash, end of period $ 263,734 $ 3,983,691\nCash used by operating activities\nCash flow used in operating activities decreased by $4.2 million to $5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024\nprimarily due to payments on overdue payables as well as unpaid voluntary deferred wages, consulting fees, and bonuses in\nFiscal 2023 after the close of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering in December 2022, coupled with significant prepaid\nexpenses during the six months ended March 31, 2023 including retention bonus for our head of PARA OPS (refundable in\nthe event he voluntarily terminates prior to a specified date as set by us), compared to regular operating activities in Fiscal\n2024, with no significant transactions.\nCash used by investing activities\nCash flow used in investing activities was less than $0.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $0.8\nmillion mainly due to the Fiscal 2023 additional investment in the product development of our PARA OPS, coupled with\n12 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nadditional low-rate initial production equipment for PARA OPS, whereas there were no significant investments in equipment\nin Fiscal 2024.\nCash (used) provided by financing activities\nCash flow used by financing activities was less than $0.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024, compared to cash\nflow provided by financing activities of $13.7 million in Fiscal 2023 primarily due to net proceeds generated from the U.S.\nIPO and Canadian Offering, partially offset by repayment of all outstanding borrowings during the Fiscal 2023 period to date.\nCapital Resources\nOur objective in managing our capital is to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern and to sustain future\ndevelopment of the business. Our senior management is responsible for managing the capital through regular review of\nfinancial information to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet operating requirements and investments to support\nits growth strategy. Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing this process. From time to time, we could issue new\ncommon shares or debt to maintain or adjust our capital structure. We are not subject to any externally imposed capital\nrequirements.\nOur primary sources of capital to date have been borrowings, security offerings, exercise of stock options and warrants, and,\nto a lesser extent, pre-commercial revenue.

In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2.5 million units at a public offering price of US$4.13 per unit (the\n“Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock (“Warrant”). The\nWarrants have a per share exercise price of US$5.00, can be exercised immediately, and expire five years from the date of\nissuance. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option to\npurchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share purchase warrants and 375,000 warrants to purchase Common\nShares. All these warrants will expire on December 8, 2027.\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one Common Share and one warrant to purchase one\nCommon Share, at a price to the public of US$4.13 per unit. The warrants will have a per Common Share exercise price of\nUS$5.00, are exercisable immediately and expire five years from the date of issuance.\nThe closing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of US$14.1 million (CAD $19.4\nmillion). After underwriting discounts and offering expenses, the net proceeds were US$11.2 million (CAD $15.2 million).\nSee Note 11(a) of Q2 Fiscal 2024 FS for further details.\nFor the estimated use of proceeds from the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, refer to our annual MD&A for Fiscal 2023 dated\nJanuary 17, 2024.\nShares for Debt Settlement\nOn December 13, 2022, we issued 56,141 Units to settle $12,000 of the March 2022 loans and USD$223,321 of the August\n2022 loans, including unpaid accrued interest and 10% premium at maturity. See Note 11(a) of the Q2 Fiscal 2024 financial\nstatements for further details.\nOn January 10, 2024, we issued 46,709 common shares in a settlement of debt in an amount of approximately $97,615. See\nNote 11(a) of the Q2 Fiscal 2024 financial statements for further details.\n14 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nPrivate Placement\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed a brokered private placement, resulting in the issuance of 1,542,194 common shares of KWESST,\nfor aggregate gross proceeds of USD$5,588,397 (approximately CAD$7.4M) (the “July 2023 Offering”).\nAs a part of the July 2023 Offering, the Company issued 1,542,194 common shares at a price of US$2.26 (CAD$2.98) per\ncommon share (each a \"Common Share\") and 930,548 pre-funded warrants at a price of US$2.259 (CAD$2.979) per pre-\nfunded warrant (each a \"Pre-funded Warrant\"), with each Common Share and Pre-funded Warrant being bundled with one\ncommon share purchase warrant of the Company (each a \"Common Warrant\"). Each Pre-Funded Warrant entitles the holder\nto acquire one Common Share at an exercise price of US$0.001 per Common Share, and each Common Warrant is\nimmediately exercisable and entitles the holder to acquire one Common Share at an exercise price of US$2.66 (CAD$3.50)\nper Common Share for a period of 60 months following the closing of the July 2023 Offering. Although the Common Shares\nand Pre-funded Warrants are each bundled with a Common Warrant, each security is issued separately. See Note 11(a) of Q2\nFiscal 2024 FS for further details.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our results\nof operations, financial condition, revenues or expenses, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nRefer to Note 8 of the Q2 Fiscal 2024 financial statements for disclosure about KWESST’s related party transactions\nconducted in the normal course of business.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS\nWe recognize financial assets and liabilities when we become party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. On initial\nrecognition, financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the financial\nassets and liabilities, except for financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, whereby the transactions\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nRefer to Note 15 of the Q2 Fiscal 2024 financial statements for further disclosure our financial instruments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nRefer to Note 2(f) of the Fiscal 2023 audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting policies and\nestimates that are critical to the understanding of our business operations and the results of our operations.\nOUTSTANDING SHARE INFORMATION\nAt March 31, 2024, KWESST’s authorized capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares with no stated par\nvalue. There were 6,049,204 outstanding and issued common shares as at March 31, 2024.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n15 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nOn April 9, 2024, we announced the closing of the Company’s underwritten public offering of 735,000 common shares and\n803,500 pre-funded warrants with an exercise price of $0.001 (\"Pre-funded Warrants\") at a public offering price of US$0.65\nper share and US$0.649 per Pre-funded Warrant, less the underwriting discount. The gross proceeds from the offering, before\ndeducting the underwriting discount of US$0.04875 per common share (being an aggregate of US$75,002 or 7.5% of the\npublic offering price of the securities) and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately\nUS$1,000,000. In addition, the Company issued to the underwriter as compensation for its services 76,925 common share\npurchase warrants with an exercise price of US$0.8125 per share.\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nAs required by National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers Annual and Interim Filings and Rule 13a-\n15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, we have evaluated, under the supervision\nand with the participation of our management, including out Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the design\nof our disclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)\nas of the end of the quarter. These DC&P are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be\npublicly disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis.\nBased upon the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) have concluded that\nour disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level due to the\nmaterial weaknesses described below under “Management’s Assessment on Internal controls over Financial Reporting”. As\na result of the material weaknesses identified, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures.\nNotwithstanding these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at March 31, 2024 in conformance with\nGAAP.\nManagement’s Assessment on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nIn accordance with National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuer’s Annual and Interim Filings and as\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, management is\nresponsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”), The Company’s\nmanagement, including the CEO and CFO, and designed ICFR based on the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO Framework”) to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with IFRS.\nInternal Controls over Financial Reporting (“ICFR”)\nICFR is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ICFR has inherent\nlimitations. ICFR is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgement and\nbreakdowns resulting from human failures. ICFR also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.\nBecause of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by\nICFR. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to\ndesign into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nAs at March 31, 2024, management assessed the design of our ICFR and concluded that our ICFR includes material\nweaknesses, described below. These material weaknesses create a reasonable possibility that material misstatements in\ninterim or annual financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. To compensate for this material\nweakness, management continues to perform additional account reconciliations and other analytical and substantive\nprocedures to ensure reliable financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The\n16 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\nmaterial weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and\nmanagement has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nManagement, under the supervision, and with the participation, of our CEO and CFO and oversight of the Board of Directors,\nevaluated the effectiveness of our ICFR as at September 30, 2023 and evaluated the design at March 31, 2024 against the\nCOSO Framework. Based on these evaluations, Management concluded that material weaknesses existed as of March 31,\n2024, as described below, and due to these material weaknesses, ICFR is not effective as of March 31, 2024.\nIneffective control environment: The Company did not have an effective control environment due to the lack of a\nsufficient complement of fully trained personnel in financial reporting, accounting and IT with assigned\nresponsibility and accountability related to ICFR. This material weakness contributed to the other material\nweaknesses below.\nSpreadsheet Controls: The Company did not implement and maintain effective controls surrounding certain\nspreadsheets. Spreadsheets are inherently prone to error due to the manual nature, which increases the risk of human\nerror. The Company’s controls related to complex spreadsheets did not address all identified risks associated with\nmanual data entry, review of inputs into management assumptions and estimates, completeness of data entry, and\nthe accuracy of mathematical formulas, impacting complex spreadsheets used in revenue, inventory, impairment\nand financial closing processes.\nIT General Controls: The Company had an aggregation of deficiencies within its IT general controls across multiple\nsystems, including deficiencies related to segregation of duties, user access and change management. As a result,\nthe Company concluded that its process-level automated and manual controls in the areas of journal entries and\nfinancial reporting that are dependent on IT general controls, information, and data derived from affected IT systems\nwere also ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.\nManagement Review Controls: The Company did not consistently have documented evidence of management\nreview controls and did not always maintain segregation of duties between preparing and reviewing analyses and\nreconciliations with respect to revenue, inventory, purchasing, and financial closing.\nChanges to Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nIn fiscal 2023 and Q2 2024 to date, the Company underwent a series of changes that materially affected areas reasonably\nlikely to continue to materially affect the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”). Management has\ncontinued efforts to develop and enhance the performance of ICFR. The addition of additional qualified finance and HR staff\nas well as the appointment of its CFO and CEO who are both experienced and qualified CPAs, will have a positive effect on\nthe Company’s ability to remediate its internal control deficiencies.\nRemediation Plan\nLate in the second half of fiscal year 2023, and subsequent to the fiscal year-end 2023, the Company strengthened its ability\nto remediate the above noted material weaknesses with the addition of:\n- Additional qualified finance and HR staff;\n- Addition of qualified CPAs in both the CFO and CEO roles;\n- Engagement of an external IT consultant and reorganizing accountability for IT general controls within the Company’s\nmanagement team with a qualified internal leader.\nThese measures have made improvements to the deficiencies that aggregate to form the material weaknesses identified above.\nManagement, with oversight from the Audit Committee will continue to implement remediation measures related to the\nidentified material weaknesses with a focus on enhancing business processes and controls as the company continues to\nmature. Management will additionally:\n17 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024\n- Review its IT strategy and investigating ways to improve key software applications and investigating ways to improve\nkey software applications.\n- Review key business processes and controls to determine where further system reliance can potentially mitigate the use\nof complex spreadsheets, improve segregation of duties, and reduce reliance on manual management review controls.\n- Improve control tools and templates to aide with the sufficient and consistent documentation of review controls and\nprocedures.\nWe believe these measures, and others that may be implemented, will remediate the material weaknesses in ICFR described\nabove.\n18 | P ag e"

This MD&A has been\nprepared with an effective date of February 14, 2024.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the\nthree months ended December 31, 2023 (“Q1 Fiscal 2024 FS”) and the annual audited consolidated financial statements and\nrelated notes for the year ended September 30, 2023 (“Fiscal 2023 FS”). The financial information presented in this MD&A\nis derived from these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\nThis MD&A contains forward-looking statements involves risk, uncertainties and assumptions, including statements\nregarding anticipated developments in future financial periods and our future plans and objectives. There can be no assurance\nthat such information will prove to be accurate, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking\nstatements. See “Forward-Looking Statements”.\nAll references to $ or dollar amounts in this MD&A are to Canadian currency unless otherwise indicated.\nAdditional information, including press releases, relating to KWESST is available for view on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nIn this MD&A, we have presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA\nthat has been adjusted for the removal of share-based compensation, foreign exchange loss (gain), change in fair value of\nderivative liabilities, and any one-time, irregular and nonrecurring items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to provide readers with a\nsupplemental measure of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be\napparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management also uses non-IFRS measures, in addition to IFRS\nfinancial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational\ndecision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these\nnon-IFRS financial measures enable us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be hidden by the\neffect of certain expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-IFRS financial measures.\nAccordingly, we believe that these non-IFRS financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for\nmeaningful comparisons and analysis in the business and provides useful information to investors and securities analysts, and\nother interested parties in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing their overall understanding of our\npast performance and future prospects.\nWe caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures do not replace the presentation of our IFRS financial results and\nshould only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. There\nare limitations in the use of non-IFRS measures because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under\nIFRS as well as they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-IFRS financial\nmeasure. Furthermore, other peers may use other non-IFRS measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-\nIFRS measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as tools for\ncomparison.\nGOING CONCERN\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have incurred\nsignificant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities.\nKWESST’s Q1 Fiscal 2024 FS have been prepared on the “going concern” basis which presumes that KWESST will be able\nto realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business is dependent\nupon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products, and the ability to raise additional\n2 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023\ndebt or equity financing, when required.

KWESST Lightning will improve interoperability between agencies with\nlightning-fast time to engagement, offered as fully cloud-based Software as a Service (“SaaS”) product. Built using\nthe “TAK” – the U.S. government Team Awareness Kit software at the foundation, the solution addresses the issues\nof scalability, interoperability, and time to engagement while customizing the user experience to meet the demands\nof the specific mission sets that responders encounter.\n• On October 31, we announced that we intended to issue 46,706 common shares at a deemed price per share of\nCAD$2.09 in settlement of a debt in an amount of approximately CAD$97,615.\n• On October 24, we announced that we received Notice of Allowance for the Luxton Low Energy Cartridge (LEC)\npatent from USPTO and notification that the USPTO will issue the patent October 31, 2023.\n• On November 13, we announced plans to expand our ARWEN business, including the introduction of a new 40mm\ncartridge for third-party riot control launchers, which constitute the bulk of launchers worldwide. In order to scale\nsupply and deliver orders in a more responsive fashion we announced a planned reorganization of the business to\nsatisfy the backlog of ARWEN orders and drive sales growth.\nWe also reported on the scale-up of PARA OPS production on the heels of successful demonstrations to law\nenforcement agencies over the summer and fall of 2023.\n• On November 27, we announced our Board of Directors (the “Board”) had appointed Sean Homuth as President\nand CEO and Kris Denis as interim CFO and Chief Compliance Officer.\n• On December 6, we announced the appointment of General (Retired) Rick Hillier to the board of directors.\n6 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023\n• On December 13, we announced that our non-lethal PARA OPS and ARWEN products will be available for law\nenforcement agencies to purchase on-line (with link from KWESST website) on Monday, December 18, 2023.\nPARA OPS has been in initial production through the fall of 2023, and the Company plans to ramp up for volume\nproduction in early calendar 2024 in conjunction with the promotion of PARA OPS at the 2024 SHOT Show held\nin Las Vegas, January 23-26. KWESST also introduced its new ARWEN 40mm cartridge at the SHOT Show in\nresponse to substantial interest from many law enforcement agencies.\nThe following is a summary of major highlights that occurred since Q1 Fiscal 2024:\n• On February 2, 2024, we announced that Dave Ibbetson, former General Manager of General Dynamics C4 Systems\nInternational, and General Dynamics Mission Systems International (“GDMS”) has been engaged as a Strategic\nDefence Advisor.\n• On February 5, 2024, we announced highlights from the Company’s attendance at SHOT Show 2024. This included\nmany law enforcement agencies at the federal, state and local level, plus foreign distributors from Europe, Asia,\nLatin America and the Middle East, specifically seeking out the Company to view the new products. The Company\nhas started receiving initial small quantity orders for test and evaluation of its 40mm baton ammunition as well as\nrequests from various agencies for live demonstrations of the Para OPS products.\n7 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following selected financial data has been extracted from Q1 Fiscal 2024 FS.\nThree months ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022 %\nRevenue $ 129,068 $ 317,333 -59%\nCost of sales ( 182,873) ( 139,584) 31%\nGross profit (53,805) 177,749 -130%\nGross margin % -41.7% 56.0%\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") 1 ,333,000 978,487 36%\nSelling and marketing (\"S&M\") 496,595 454,187 9%\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") 624,840 262,829 138%\nTotal operating expenses 2 ,454,435 1 ,695,503 45%\nOperating loss ( 2,508,240) ( 1,517,754) 65%\nOther expenses\nShare issuance costs - ( 1,367,093) N/A\nNet finance costs ( 13,197) ( 543,577) -98%\nForeign exchange gain (loss) 9 1,710 ( 130,356) -170%\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities 2 ,030,754 1 ,350,423 50%\nTotal other expenses, net 2 ,109,267 ( 690,603) -405%\nNet loss $ (398,973) $ (2,208,357) -82%\nEBITDA loss (1) $ (64,355) $ (1,578,469) -96%\nAdjusted EBITDA loss(1) $ (2,123,330) $ (1,306,377) 63%\nLoss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.07) $ (1.37) -95%\nWeighted average common shares - basic 5 ,616,782 1 ,609,121 249%\n(1) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measures.

Q1 Fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA loss was $2.1 million, an\nincrease of $0.8 million over the comparable prior period mainly due to decreased revenue and increased operating expenses\ndriven by increased personnel costs, professional fees, insurance costs, and regulatory and compliance costs. The adjustments\nto EBITDA loss for Q1 Fiscal 2024 included the change in fair value of derivative liabilities. Due to the lower volume of\nstock-based grants in the last 12 months immediately prior to December 31, 2023, compared to same prior period, this has\nresulted in a reduction in stock-based compensation expense in the current quarter compared to Q1 Fiscal 2023.\nRevenue\nTotal revenue decreased by $0.2 million in the first quarter compared to Q1 Fiscal 2023, mainly due to reduction in the sale\nof ARWEN products in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023 that had an additional $0.1 million generated from our digitization\nbusiness line and $0.1 million from our non-lethal business line (driven from sale of ARWEN products).\nWe expect revenue to increase as we continue hiring and deploying resources under the recently announced Canadian\nGovernment contract which saw revenue commence in Q1 2024. As the transition from the incumbent continues, we expect\nto receive, and hire and staff against additional work tasks. We also expect revenue to increase as we work through current\norder backlog from ARWEN as well as expected demand/future order for the new ARWEN 40mm ammunition and PARA\nOPS products.\nGross Profit\nIn Q1 Fiscal 2024, the gross profit was a negative $0.1 million, compared to a profit of $0.2 million in the same period in\n2023. In Q1 2024, on a fixed-price digitization contract we spent more hours than anticipated and as compared to Q1 2023,\nresulting in a loss for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023. Also contributing are the indirect costs associated\nwith the ramp up of the Canadian Government contracts. There were no such losses in Q1 2023. We expect gross profit /\nmargin to be positive and increase during Fiscal 2024 as we ramp up anticipated revenue in the year on the Canadian\nGovernment as well as the other product lines described above.\nOperating Expenses (“OPEX”)\nTotal OPEX was $2.5 million for Q1 Fiscal 2024 compared to $1.7 million in Q1 Fiscal 2023 for a total increase of $0.8\nmillion over the comparable prior year due to the following factors:\n9 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023\n• G&A increased by $0.4 million, primarily due to the amortization of the LEC intangible in Q1 2024 ($0.3 million)\nas well as an increase in senior management and directors compensation to be in line with market and additional\npersonnel as compared to Q1 2023.\n• S&M increased by less than $0.1 million, primarily due to an increase in consulting fees in Q1 2024 as compared to\nQ1 2023.\n• R&D increased by $0.4 million, primarily due to the fact that the LEC has reached commercial feasibility and any\nassociated costs are no longer being capitalized, while it was still in the development stage in Q1 2023.\nOther income (expenses), net\nFor Q1 2024, our total other income was $2.1 million, compared to total other expenses of $0.7 million for Q1 2023. The\nchange in other income (expenses), net was driven mainly by the $0.7 million favorable change in fair value of warrant\nliabilities as a result of the remeasurement of the warrant liabilities at December 31, 2023, driven by a decrease in the\nunderlying common share price on December 31, 2023. Under IFRS, we are required to remeasure the warrant liabilities at\neach reporting date until they are exercised or expired. This was also explained by:\n• $0.5 million decrease in net finance costs is primarily due to the Q1 2023 recognition of the remaining unamortized\naccretion costs and interest expense relating to the repayment of all outstanding loans, following the closing of the\nU.S. IPO and Canadian Offering;\n• Q1 2023 had $1.4 million in Share Offering Costs relating to the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering. There were no\nofferings in Q1 2024; and\n• $0.2 million increase in foreign exchange gain due to depreciation in the U.S. currency during the period.\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\nThe following tables summarize selected results for the eight most recent completed quarters to December 31, 2023\n(unaudited):\n2024 2023 2022\n($ in thousands) Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2\nRevenue 1 29 6 06 1 50 1 61 3 17 2 55 2 82 1 66\nNet loss ( 399) ( 2,419) ( 3,452) ( 1,227) ( 2,208) ( 2,345) ( 2,600) ( 2,290)\nNote: due to preparing the table in thousands, there may be rounding differences.\nQuarterly Results Trend Analysis\nThere is no material change to our quarterly results trend from our disclosure in our annual MD&A dated January 17, 2024,\nexcept that we expect further volatility with our quarterly revenue during Fiscal 2024 due to ramp up of new military contracts\nas we launch PARA OPS. Additionally, we expect further volatility with our quarterly net loss due to the remeasurement of\nwarrant liabilities at each reporting period, with the change in fair value recorded through P&L.\n10 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe following table summarizes our financial position:\nDecember 31, September 30,\n2023 2023\nAssets\nCurrent $ 4 ,464,428 $ 6 ,842,074\nNon-current 4 ,642,107 4 ,916,758\nTotal assets $ 9 ,106,535 $ 1 1,758,832\nLiabilities\nCurrent $ 4 ,023,152 $ 6 ,383,635\nNon-current 1 ,451,953 1 ,439,577\nTotal liabilities 5 ,475,105 7 ,823,212\nNet assets $ 3,631,430 $ 3,935,620\nWorking capital (1) $ 441,276 $ 4 58,439\n(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.\nOur working capital was $0.4 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of less than $0.1 million from September 30, 2023.\nThere were no significant transactions in the period affecting working capital. The decrease in cash of $2.9 million was offset\nby the increase in prepaids of $0.5 million, a decrease in trade payables and accrued liabilities of $0.2 million and a decrease\nin the warrant liabilities of $2.1 million.\nTotal assets decreased by $2.7 million from September 30, 2023, mainly due to a decrease in cash of $2.9 million, a decrease\nin the unamortized value of non-current assets of $0.3 million offset by an increase in prepaids of $0.5 million due mostly to\nthe timing of insurance payments.\nTotal liabilities decreased by $2.3 million from September 30, 2023, mainly due a decrease in the warrant liabilities of $2.1\nmillion along with a decrease in trade payables and accrued liabilities of $0.2 million due to the timing of payments to\nsuppliers.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAvailable Liquidity\nOur approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we always have sufficient liquidity to meet our\nliabilities as they come due. We regularly perform cash flow forecasts to ensure that we have sufficient cash to meet our\noperational needs while maintaining sufficient liquidity. At this time, we do not use any derivative financial instruments to\nhedge our currency risk.\nOn July 21, 2023, we closed the Private Placement pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds of USD$5.59\nmillion (or CAD$7.4 million), before underwriting and offering costs (refer to the annual MD&A dated January 17, 2024 for\n11 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023\nfurther details including our expected use of proceeds). On December 9, 2022, we closed both the U.S. IPO and Canadian\nOffering pursuant to which we received aggregate gross proceeds of USD$14.1 million (or CAD$19.4 million), before\nunderwriting and offering costs (refer to the annual MD&A dated January 17, 2024 for further details including our expected\nuse of proceeds).\nAt December 31, 2023, our cash position was $2.5 million, a decrease of $2.9 million since September 30, 2023 primarily\ndue to cash used in operations of $2.8 million.\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our other products and have incurred\nsignificant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern and realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business\nis dependent upon closing timely additional sales orders, timely commercial launch of new products, and the ability to raise\nadditional debt or equity financing, when required. There are various risks and uncertainties affecting our future financial\nposition and our performance. However, we may require additional capital in the event we fail to implement our business\nplan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or financial performance. There is no\nassurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required in the future. Potential sources of capital may\ninclude additional equity and/or debt financings. In our view, the availability of capital will be affected by, among other\nthings, capital market conditions, the success of our PARA OPS system commercialization efforts, timing for winning new\ncustomer contracts, potential acquisitions, and other relevant considerations (see Risk Factors). In the event we raise\nadditional funds by issuing equity securities, our existing shareholders will likely experience dilution, and any additional\nincurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operational and\nfinancial covenants that could further restrict our operations. Any failure to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or\nat all may require us to significantly change or curtail our current or planned operations in order to conserve cash until such\ntime, if ever, that sufficient proceeds from operations are generated, and could result in us not being in a position to advance\nour commercialization strategy or take advantage of business opportunities.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the respective periods:\nThree months ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nCash inflows (outflows) by activity:\nOperting activities $ (2,851,179) $ (6,578,760)\nInvesting activities (46,113) (550,611)\nFinancing acitivities (35,585) 13,734,316\nNet cash inflows (outflows) $ (2,932,877) $ 6,604,945\nCash, beginning of period 5,407,009 170,545\nCash, end of period $ 2,474,132 $ 6,775,490\nCash used by operating activities\nCash flow used in operating activities decreased by $3.7 million to $2.9 million for the three months ended December 31,\n2023 primarily due to the Q1 2023 payments on overdue payables as well as unpaid voluntary deferred wages, consulting\nfees, and bonuses until we closed the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, coupled with significant prepaid expenses during the\nthree months ended December 31, 2023 including the renewal of D&O and commercial insurance coverage, royalties relating\nto future Phantom sales, capital market advisory services, and retention bonus for our head of PARA OPS (refundable in the\nevent he voluntarily terminates prior to a specified date as set by us).

Compared to minor additions\nto equipment in Q1 2024.\nCash (used) provided by financing activities\nCash flow used by financing activities was less than $0.1 million in Q1 Fiscal 2024 compared to cash flow provided by\nfinancing activities of $13.7 million in Q1 Fiscal 2023 primarily due to net proceeds generated from the U.S. IPO and\nCanadian Offering, partially offset by repayment of all outstanding borrowings during the Q1 Fiscal 2023 quarter.\nCapital Resources\nOur objective in managing our capital is to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern and to sustain future\ndevelopment of the business. Our senior management is responsible for managing the capital through regular review of\nfinancial information to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet operating requirements and investments to support\nits growth strategy. Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing this process. From time to time, we could issue new\ncommon shares or debt to maintain or adjust our capital structure. We are not subject to any externally imposed capital\nrequirements.\nOur primary sources of capital to date have been borrowings, security offerings, exercise of stock options and warrants, and,\nto a lesser extent, pre-commercial revenue.

In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2.5 million units at a public offering price of US$4.13 per unit (the\n“Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock (“Warrant”). The\nWarrants have a per share exercise price of US$5.00, can be exercised immediately, and expire five years from the date of\nissuance. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option to\npurchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share purchase warrants and 375,000 warrants to purchase Common\nShares. All these warrants will expire on December 8, 2027.\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one Common Share and one warrant to purchase one\nCommon Share, at a price to the public of US$4.13 per unit. The warrants will have a per Common Share exercise price of\nUS$5.00, are exercisable immediately and expire five years from the date of issuance.\nThe closing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of US$14.1 million (CAD $19.4\nmillion).

Each Pre-Funded Warrant entitles the holder\nto acquire one Common Share at an exercise price of US$0.001 per Common Share, and each Common Warrant is\nimmediately exercisable and entitles the holder to acquire one Common Share at an exercise price of US$2.66 (CAD$3.50)\nper Common Share for a period of 60 months following the closing of the July 2023 Offering. Although the Common Shares\nand Pre-funded Warrants are each bundled with a Common Warrant, each security is issued separately. See Note 11(a) of Q1\nFiscal 2024 FS for further details.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our results\nof operations, financial condition, revenues or expenses, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nRefer to Note 8 of the Q1 Fiscal 2024 financial statements for disclosure about KWESST’s related party transactions\nconducted in the normal course of business.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS\nWe recognize financial assets and liabilities when we become party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. On initial\nrecognition, financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the financial\nassets and liabilities, except for financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, whereby the transactions\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nRefer to Note 15 of the Q1 Fiscal 2024 financial statements for further disclosure our financial instruments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nRefer to Note 2(f) of the Fiscal 2023 audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting policies and\nestimates that are critical to the understanding of our business operations and the results of our operations.\nOUTSTANDING SHARE INFORMATION\nAt December 31, 2023, KWESST’s authorized capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares with no stated par\nvalue. There were 5,616,782 outstanding and issued common shares as at December 31, 2023.\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nAs required by National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers Annual and Interim Filings and Rule 13a-\n15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, we have evaluated, under the supervision\nand with the participation of our management, including out Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the design\nof our disclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)\nas of the end of the quarter. These DC&P are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be\npublicly disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis.\n15 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023\nBased upon the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) have concluded that\nour disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023 at the reasonable assurance level due to\nthe material weaknesses described below under “Management’s Assessment on Internal controls over Financial Reporting”.\nAs a result of the material weaknesses identified, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures.\nNotwithstanding these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2023 in conformance with\nGAAP.\nManagement’s Assessment on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nIn accordance with National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuer’s Annual and Interim Filings and as\nrequired by Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, management is\nresponsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”), The Company’s\nmanagement, including the CEO and CFO, and designed ICFR based on the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO Framework”) to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with IFRS.\nInternal Controls over Financial Reporting (“ICFR”)\nICFR is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation\nof financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ICFR has inherent\nlimitations. ICFR is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgement and\nbreakdowns resulting from human failures. ICFR also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.\nBecause of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by\nICFR. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to\ndesign into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nAs at December 31, 2023, management assessed the design of our ICFR and concluded that our ICFR includes material\nweaknesses, described below. These material weaknesses create a reasonable possibility that material misstatements in\ninterim or annual financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. To compensate for this material\nweakness, management continues to perform additional account reconciliations and other analytical and substantive\nprocedures to ensure reliable financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The\nmaterial weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and\nmanagement has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nManagement, under the supervision, and with the participation, of our CEO and CFO and oversight of the Board of Directors,\nevaluated the effectiveness of our ICFR as at September 30, 2023 and evaluated the design at December 31, 2023 against the\nCOSO Framework. Based on these evaluations, Management concluded that material weaknesses existed as of December\n31, 2023, as described below, and due to these material weaknesses, ICFR is not effective as of December 31, 2023.\nIneffective control environment: The Company did not have an effective control environment due to the lack of a\nsufficient complement of fully trained personnel in financial reporting, accounting and IT with assigned\nresponsibility and accountability related to ICFR. This material weakness contributed to the other material\nweaknesses below.\nSpreadsheet Controls: The Company did not implement and maintain effective controls surrounding certain\nspreadsheets. Spreadsheets are inherently prone to error due to the manual nature, which increases the risk of human\nerror. The Company’s controls related to complex spreadsheets did not address all identified risks associated with\nmanual data entry, review of inputs into management assumptions and estimates, completeness of data entry, and\nthe accuracy of mathematical formulas, impacting complex spreadsheets used in revenue, inventory, impairment\nand financial closing processes.\n16 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023\nIT General Controls: The Company had an aggregation of deficiencies within its IT general controls across multiple\nsystems, including deficiencies related to segregation of duties, user access and change management. As a result,\nthe Company concluded that its process-level automated and manual controls in the areas of journal entries and\nfinancial reporting that are dependent on IT general controls, information, and data derived from affected IT systems\nwere also ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.\nManagement Review Controls: The Company did not consistently have documented evidence of management\nreview controls and did not always maintain segregation of duties between preparing and reviewing analyses and\nreconciliations with respect to revenue, inventory, purchasing, and financial closing.\nChanges to Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nIn fiscal 2023 and Q1 2024, the Company underwent a series of changes that materially affected areas reasonably likely to\ncontinue to materially affect the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”). Management has continued\nefforts to develop and enhance the performance of ICFR. The addition of additional qualified finance and HR staff as well as\nthe appointment of its CFO and CEO who are both experienced and qualified CPAs, will have a positive effect on the\nCompany’s ability to remediate its internal control deficiencies.\nRemediation Plan\nLate in the second half of fiscal year 2023, and subsequent to the fiscal year-end 2023, the Company strengthened its ability\nto remediate the above noted material weaknesses with the addition of:\n- Additional qualified finance and HR staff;\n- Addition of qualified CPAs in both the CFO and CEO roles;\n- Engagement of an external IT consultant and reorganizing accountability for IT general controls within the Company’s\nmanagement team with a qualified internal leader.\nThese measures have made improvements to the deficiencies that aggregate to form the material weaknesses identified above.\nManagement, with oversight from the Audit Committee will continue to implement remediation measures related to the\nidentified material weaknesses with a focus on enhancing business processes and controls as the company continues to\nmature. Management will additionally:\n- Review its IT strategy and investigating ways to improve key software applications and investigating ways to improve\nkey software applications.\n- Review key business processes and controls to determine where further system reliance can potentially mitigate the use\nof complex spreadsheets, improve segregation of duties, and reduce reliance on manual management review controls.\n- Improve control tools and templates to aide with the sufficient and consistent documentation of review controls and\nprocedures.\nWe believe these measures, and others that may be implemented, will remediate the material weaknesses in ICFR described\nabove.\n17 | P age"

This MD&A has been\nprepared with an effective date of February 13, 2023.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the\nthree months ended December 31, 2022 (“Q1 Fiscal 2023 FS”) and the annual audited consolidated financial statements and\nrelated notes for the year ended September 30, 2022 (“Fiscal 2022 FS”). The financial information presented in this MD&A\nis derived from these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\nThis MD&A contains forward-looking statements involves risk, uncertainties and assumptions, including statements\nregarding anticipated developments in future financial periods and our future plans and objectives. There can be no assurance\nthat such information will prove to be accurate, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking\nstatements. See “Forward-Looking Statements”.\nAll references to $ or dollar amounts in this MD&A are to Canadian currency unless otherwise indicated.\nAdditional information, including press releases, relating to KWESST is available for view on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nIn this MD&A, we have presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA\nthat has been adjusted for the removal of stock-based compensation, foreign exchange loss (gain), change in fair value of\nderivative liabilities, and any one-time, irregular and nonrecurring items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to provide readers with a\nsupplemental measure of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be\napparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management also uses non-IFRS measures, in addition to IFRS\nfinancial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational\ndecision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these\nnon-IFRS financial measures enable us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be hidden by the\neffect of certain expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-IFRS financial measures.\nAccordingly, we believe that these non-IFRS financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for\nmeaningful comparisons and analysis in the business and provides useful information to investors and securities analysts, and\nother interested parties in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing their overall understanding of our\npast performance and future prospects.\nWe caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures do not replace the presentation of our IFRS financial results and\nshould only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. There\nare limitations in the use of non-IFRS measures because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under\nIFRS as well as they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-IFRS financial\nmeasure. Furthermore, other peers may use other non-IFRS measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-\nIFRS measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as tools for\ncomparison.\nGOING CONCERN\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have incurred\nsignificant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities.\nKWESST’s Q1 Fiscal 2023 FS have been prepared on the “going concern” basis which presumes that KWESST will be able\nto realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.

Our\nregistered office is located at 550 Burrard Street, Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and our corporate office\nis located at Unit 1, 155 Terrence Matthews Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. We have representative offices in the\nfollowing foreign locations: Washington DC (United States), London (United Kingdom), and Abu Dhabi (United Arab\nEmirates).\nAs an early commercial-stage technology company, we develop and commercialize next-generation technology solutions that\ndeliver a tactical advantage for military, public safety agencies and personal defense markets. We focus on three niche market\nsegments as follows:\nOur core mission is to protect and save lives.\nMajor Highlights – Quarter ended December 31, 2022 (“Q1 Fiscal 2023”)\nThe following is a summary of the major highlights that occurred during the quarter ended Q1 Fiscal 2023:\n• On October 28, 2022, in advance of the Nasdaq listing, we effected a one for seventy (1-for-70) reverse stock split\n(the “Reverse Split”) of our common shares (the “Common Shares”) to meet Nasdaq’s initial listing requirements.\nAccordingly, all shareholders of record at the opening of business on October 28, 2022, received one issued and\noutstanding common share of KWESST in exchange for seventy outstanding common shares of KWESST. No\nfractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Split. All fractional shares created by the Reverse\nSplit were rounded to the nearest whole number of common shares, with any fractional interest representing 0.5 or\nmore common shares entitling holders thereof to receive one whole common share. Furthermore, the exercise price\nand number of common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options were proportionately\nadjusted to reflect the Reverse Split. The restricted share units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”)\nhave also been adjusted for the Reverse Split. While the number of warrants has not changed as a result of the\nReverse Split; the conversion rate for each warrant was adjusted from one common share to 0.01428571 common\nshare. All information respecting outstanding common shares and other securities of KWESST, including net loss\nper share, in the current and comparative periods presented herein give effect to the Reverse Split.\n• On November 2, 2022, we won our first Battlefield Laser Defense Systems (“BLDS”) order of USD$330,000 from\nNordic Defence & Security AS of Oslo, Norway, a trading and consulting agency offering solutions for the army,\nnavy, air force in addition to other professional users such as the police, fire departments and different security\ndependent organizations, for the provision of four BLDS to be delivered by May 2, 2023. These BLDS units are\nfor Norwegian Special Operating Forces (“SOF”). Through this initial order, we are well positioned to supply a\nhigher quantity of BLDS to this customer in calendar year 2024; however, there is no assurance on this timing or\nthat we will receive additional orders for our BLDS from Norwegian SOF.\n5 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022\n• On December 7, 2022, we completed our cross-border uplisting on the Nasdaq and our Common Shares began\ntrading on the same day, under the stock symbol “KWE” and the U.S. Warrants issued (as defined below) in the\nU.S. IPO (as defined below) were also listed under the symbol “KWESW” on the same day.\n• On December 9, 2022, we closed our U.S. IPO and the Canadian Offering (as defined below) for aggregate gross\nproceeds of USD$14.1 million, before deducting underwriting and offering costs (see Financial Condition,\nLiquidity and Capital Resources section for further details).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following selected financial data has been extracted from Q1 Fiscal 2023 FS.\nThree months ended December 31, Change\n2022 2021 %\nRevenue $ 317,333 $ 17,465 1717%\nCost of sales (139,584) (25,479) 448%\nGross profit 177,749 (8,014) -2318%\nGross margin % 56.0% -45.9%\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") 978,487 1,055,140 -7%\nSelling and marketing (\"S&M\") 454,187 1,346,391 -66%\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") 262,829 794,412 -67%\nTotal operating expenses 1,695,503 3,195,943 -47%\nOperating loss (1,517,754) (3,203,957) -53%\nOther expenses\nShare issuance costs (1,367,093) - N/A\nNet finance costs (543,577) (47,642) 1041%\nForeign exchange gain (loss) (130,356) 8,745 -1591%\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities 1,350,423 - N/A\nTotal other expenses, net (690,603) (38,897) 1675%\nNet loss $ (2,208,357) $ (3,242,854) -32%\nEBITDA loss (1) $ (1,578,469) $ (3,123,175) -49%\nAdjusted EBITDA loss(1) $ (1,306,377) $ (2,204,390) -41%\nLoss per share - basic and diluted $ (1.37) $ (4.63) -70%\nWeighted average common shares - basic 1,609,121 700,315 130%\n(1) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measures.

Adjusted\nEBITDA loss was $1.3 million, a decrease of 41% over the comparable prior period mainly due to higher revenue and lower\noperating expenses. The adjustments to EBITDA loss for Q1 Fiscal 2023 included share insurance costs relating to warrant\nliabilities, and the change in fair value of derivative liabilities, all of which are related to the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO\nand Canadian Offering (see Notes 12 and 13 of the Q1 Fiscal 2023 FS). Due to the lower volume of stock-based grants in\nthe last 12 months immediately prior to December 31, 2022, compared to same prior period, this has resulted in a material\nreduction in stock-based compensation expense in the current quarter compared to Q1 Fiscal 2022.\nCurrent Quarter Variance Analysis (Q1 Fiscal 2023 vs. Q1 Fiscal 2022)\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased by $0.3 million during Q1 Fiscal 2023 compared to same quarter in Fiscal 2022 mainly due to\nnegligible contract delivery in the prior period. For the current quarter, the non-lethal product line generated $0.1 million of\nrevenue due to the acquisition of Police Ordnance in December 2021. Additionally, digitization product line generated $0.2\nmillion related to two contracts.\nWe expect revenue to ramp up during Fiscal 2023 with new anticipated military contracts, coupled with the pending\ncommercial launch of our PARA OPS, scheduled for end of Q2 Fiscal 2023, and full year revenue results from the ARWEN\nproduct line.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit was $0.2 million for Q1 Fiscal 2023, or gross margin of 56.0%, compared to a negligible loss in Q1 Fiscal\n2022, primarily due to negligible revenue in the same period in Fiscal 2022. We expect continued fluctuation in gross profit\n/ margin during Fiscal 2023 as we ramp up anticipated revenue through the fiscal year.\n7 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022\nOperating Expenses (“OPEX”)\nTotal OPEX were $1.7 million for Q1 Fiscal 2023, a 47% decrease over the comparable prior period. Excluding share-based\ncompensation (non-cash item), total OPEX was $1.6 million compared to $2.3 million, a 31% decrease over the comparable\nprior year.\n• G&A decreased by 7%; however, excluding share-based compensation expense, G&A increased by $0.2 million or\n37% primarily due to retention bonus earned by our CFO, higher consulting fees relating to the non-lethal business\nline particularly for completing the PARA OPS multi-shot device prototype in advance of the Shot Show held in\nJanuary 2023, and higher D&O insurance costs due to the Nasdaq listing in the current quarter. These were partially\noffset by lower professional fees as the professional fees incurred relating to the U.S. IPO and Canadian offering\nwere recognized as part of share offering costs (see below). In Q1 Fiscal 2022, we incurred professional fees in\nconnection with the initial confidential filing of the Form 20-F Annual Report which we subsequently discontinued\nin Q3 Fiscal 2022.\n• S&M decreased by 66%; however, excluding share-based compensation expense, S&M decreased by $0.6 million\nor 57% primarily due to lower investor relations and promotional spend, coupled with lower U.S. business\ndevelopment consulting costs in the current quarter.\n• R&D decreased by 67%; however, excluding share-based compensation expense, R&D decreased by $0.4 million\nor 60% primarily due to reallocating most of our engineering resources to deliver on customer contracts during the\ncurrent quarter. The related costs are reported as part of cost of sales (for delivered performance obligations to\ncustomers) and work-in-progress inventories.\nOther expenses, net\nTotal other expenses increased $0.7 million, for Q1 Fiscal 2023, compared to a negligible amount in Q1 Fiscal 2022. This\nincrease was driven mainly by:\n• $0.5 million increase in net finance costs is primarily due to the recognition of the remaining unamortized accretion\ncosts and interest expense relating to the repayment of all outstanding loans, following the closing of the U.S. IPO\nand Canadian Offering during the quarter;\n• $0.1 million increase in foreign exchange loss due to appreciation in the U.S. currency during the current quarter;\nand\n• $1.4 million in Share Offering Costs relating to the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering. Under IFRS, we are required\nto allocate proportionately the $4.2 million total underwriting and share offering costs (collectively “Share Offering\nCosts”) between equity and warrant liabilities resulting from the U.S. IPO and Canadian offering. The portion of\nthe Share Offering Costs allocated to warrant liabilities were expensed.\nThe above increase in other expenses were partially offset by a $1.4 million favorable change in fair value of warrant liabilities\nas a result of the remeasurement of the warrant liabilities at December 31, 2022, driven by a decrease in the underlying\ncommon share price on the last trading day prior to December 31, 2022. Under IFRS, we are required to remeasure the\nwarrant liabilities at each reporting date until they are exercised or expired.\n8 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\nThe following tables summarize selected results for the eight most recent completed quarters to December 31, 2022\n(unaudited).\n2023 2022 2021\n($ in thousands) Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2\nRevenue 317 255 282 166 17 160 522 448\nNet loss (2,208) (2,345) (2,600) (2,290) (2,290) (2,884) (2,628) (2,277)\nNote: due to preparing the table in thousands, there may be rounding differences.\nQuarterly Results Trend Analysis\nThere is no material change to our quarterly results trend from our disclosure in our annual MD&A dated January 27, 2023,\nexcept that we expect further volatility with our quarterly revenue during Fiscal 2023 due to the launch of PARA OPS products\nand anticipated new military contracts. Additionally, we expect further volatility with our quarterly net loss due to the\nremeasurement of warrant liabilities at each reporting period, with the change in fair value recorded through P&L.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe following table summarizes our financial position:\nDecember 31, September 30,\n2022 2022\nAssets\nCurrent $ 9,839,473 $ 1,516,393\nNon-current 6,265,307 5,807,070\nTotal assets $ 16,104,780 $ 7,323,463\nLiabilities\nCurrent $ 6,789,212 $ 6,925,880\nNon-current 1,346,977 1,400,474\nTotal liabilities 8,136,189 8,326,354\nNet assets $ 7,968,591 $ (1,002,891)\nWorking capital (1) $ 3,050,261 $ (5,409,487)\n(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.\nOur working capital was $3.1 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $8.5 million from September 30, 2022. The\nincrease was primarily due to net proceeds from the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, offset partially by repayment of all\noutstanding loans, payments of overdue accounts payables and certain accrued liabilities, and net operating loss for Q1 Fiscal\n2023. Current liabilities include warrant liabilities, a non-cash liability item (see Note 12 of Q1 Fiscal 2023). Excluding\nwarrant liabilities, working capital would be $7.5 million. These warrant liabilities will be extinguished when the warrants\nare exercised or expired. If exercised, the proceeds will provide us with additional capital to fund our future working capital\nrequirements. There is no assurance that any warrants will be exercised.\n9 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022\nTotal assets increased by $8.8 million from September 30, 2022, mainly due to $8.3 million increase in currents assets for\nthe same reason noted above for the increase in working capital.\nTotal liabilities decreased by $0.2 million from September 30, 2022, to $8.1 million at December 31, 2022, mainly due to a\nreduction in current liabilities. While we have significantly paid the outstanding accounts payable and fully repaid all\noutstanding loans during the current quarter, these were offset by the recognition of warrant liabilities at fair value as noted\nabove. As at December 31, 2022, we had $4.4 million of warrant liabilities.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAvailable Liquidity\nOur approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we always have sufficient liquidity to meet our\nliabilities as they come due. We regularly perform cash flow forecasts to ensure that we have sufficient cash to meet our\noperational needs while maintaining sufficient liquidity. At this time, we do not use any derivative financial instruments to\nhedge our currency risk.\nAt December 31, 2022, our cash position was $6.8 million, an increase of $6.6 million since September 30, 2022 primarily\ndue to net proceeds from the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, offset partially by repayment of all outstanding loans, payments\nof overdue accounts payables and certain accrued liabilities, and net operating loss for Q1 Fiscal 2023.\nOn December 9, 2022, we closed both the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering pursuant to which we received aggregate gross\nproceeds of USD$14.1 million (or CAD$19.2 million), before underwriting and offering costs (see below, Capital Resources,\nfor further details including our expected use of proceeds). With the remaining cash position at December 31, 2023 and\ncollections of receivables, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital to timely fund our working capital and\ncontractual obligations, over the next twelve months. However, we may require additional capital in the event we fail to\nimplement our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or financial\nperformance. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required in the future. Potential\nsources of capital may include additional equity and/or debt financings. In our view, the availability of capital will be affected\nby, among other things, capital market conditions, the success of our PARA OPS system commercialization efforts, timing\nfor winning new customer contracts, potential acquisitions, and other relevant considerations (see Risk Factors). In the event\nwe raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our existing shareholders will likely experience dilution, and any\nadditional incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to\noperational and financial covenants that could further restrict our operations. Any failure to raise additional funds on terms\nfavorable to us or at all may require us to significantly change or curtail our current or planned operations in order to conserve\ncash until such time, if ever, that sufficient proceeds from operations are generated, and could result in us not being in a\nposition to advance our commercialization strategy or take advantage of business opportunities.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the respective periods:\nThree months ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ ( 6,578,760) $ ( 1,864,760)\nInvesting activities ( 550,611) (68,960)\nFinancing acitivities 13,734,316 (20,401)\nNet cash outflows $ 6,604,945 $ (1,954,121)\nCash, beginning of period 170,545 2,688,105\nCash, end of period $ 6,775,490 $ 733,984\n10 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022\nCash used by operating activities\nCash flow used in operating activities increased by $4.7 million to $6.6 million for Q1 Fiscal 2023 compared to Q1 Fiscal\n2022 primarily due to payments on overdue payables as well as unpaid voluntary deferred wages, consulting fees, and bonuses\nuntil we closed the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, coupled with significant prepaid expenses during the current quarter.\nPrepaid expenses increased by $1.8 million mainly due to the renewal of D&O and commercial insurance coverage, royalties\nrelating to future Phantom sales, capital market advisory services, and retention bonus for our head of PARA OPS (refundable\nin the event he voluntarily terminates prior to a specified date as set by us).\nCash used by investing activities\nCash flow used in investing activities was $0.6 million in Q1 Fiscal 2023 compared to $69 thousand in Q1 Fiscal 2022 mainly\ndue to additional investment in the product development of our PARA OPS, coupled with additional low-rate initial\nproduction equipment for PARA OPS.\nIn Q1 Fiscal 2022, we benefited from $0.2 million cash from Police Ordnance following its acquisition.\nCash provided by financing activities\nCash flow provided by financing activities was $13.7 million in Q1 Fiscal 2023 compared to a negligible amount for Q1\nFiscal 2022 primarily due to net proceeds generated from the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, partially offset by repayment\nof all outstanding borrowings during the current quarter.\nCapital Resources\nOur objective in managing our capital is to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern and to sustain future\ndevelopment of the business. Our senior management is responsible for managing the capital through regular review of\nfinancial information to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet operating requirements and investments to support\nits growth strategy. Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing this process. From time to time, we could issue new\ncommon shares or debt to maintain or adjust our capital structure. We are not subject to any externally imposed capital\nrequirements.\nOur primary sources of capital to date have been from borrowings, security offerings, exercise of stock options and warrants,\nand, to a lesser extent, pre-commercial revenue.

In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2.5 million units at a public offering price of US$4.13 per unit (the\n“Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock (“Warrant”). The\nWarrants have a per share exercise price of US$5.00, can be exercised immediately, and expire five years from the date of\nissuance. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option to\npurchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share purchase warrants and 375,000 warrants to purchase Common\nShares. All these warrants will expire on December 8, 2027.\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one Common Share and one warrant to purchase one\nCommon Share, at a price to the public of US$4.13 per unit.

This MD&A has been prepared\nwith an effective date of May 11, 2023.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the\nthree and six months ended March 31, 2023 (“Q2 Fiscal 2023 FS”) and the annual audited consolidated financial statements\nand related notes for the year ended September 30, 2022 (“Fiscal 2022 FS”). The financial information presented in this\nMD&A is derived from these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\nThis MD&A contains forward-looking statements involves risk, uncertainties and assumptions, including statements\nregarding anticipated developments in future financial periods and our future plans and objectives. There can be no assurance\nthat such information will prove to be accurate, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking\nstatements. See “Forward-Looking Statements”.\nAll references to $ or dollar amounts in this MD&A are to Canadian currency unless otherwise indicated.\nAdditional information, including press releases, relating to KWESST is available for view on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nIn this MD&A, we have presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA\nthat has been adjusted for the removal of share-based compensation, foreign exchange loss (gain), change in fair value of\nderivative liabilities, and any one-time, irregular and nonrecurring items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to provide readers with a\nsupplemental measure of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be\napparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management also uses non-IFRS measures, in addition to IFRS\nfinancial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational\ndecision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these\nnon-IFRS financial measures enable us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be hidden by the\neffect of certain expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-IFRS financial measures.\nAccordingly, we believe that these non-IFRS financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for\nmeaningful comparisons and analysis in the business and provides useful information to investors and securities analysts, and\nother interested parties in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing their overall understanding of our\npast performance and future prospects.\nWe caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures do not replace the presentation of our IFRS financial results and\nshould only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. There\nare limitations in the use of non-IFRS measures because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under\nIFRS as well as they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-IFRS financial\nmeasure. Furthermore, other peers may use other non-IFRS measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-\nIFRS measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as tools for\ncomparison.\nGOING CONCERN\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have incurred\nsignificant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities.\nKWESST’s Q2 Fiscal 2023 FS have been prepared on the “going concern” basis which presumes that KWESST will be able\nto realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.

Q2 and YTD Fiscal 2023\nadjusted EBITDA loss was $2.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively, an increase of 58% and 2% over the comparable prior\nperiods mainly due to increased operating expenses driven by increased personnel costs, consulting costs, professional fees,\nregulatory and compliance costs, and tradeshows. The adjustments to EBITDA loss for Q2 and YTD Fiscal 2023 included\nshare insurance costs relating to warrant liabilities, and the change in fair value of derivative liabilities, all of which are related\nto the warrants issued in the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering (see Notes 12 and 13 of the Q2 Fiscal 2023 FS). Due to the\nlower volume of stock-based grants in the last 12 months immediately prior to March 31, 2023, compared to same prior\nperiod, this has resulted in a material reduction in stock-based compensation expense in the current quarter and YTD\ncompared to Q2 and YTD Fiscal 2023.\nRevenue\nTotal revenue remained consistent with the comparable prior period in the three months ended March 31, 2023, and increased\nby $0.3 million in YTD Fiscal 2023 compared to YTD Fiscal 2022, mainly due to an additional $0.2 million generated from\nour digitization business line and $0.1 million from our non-lethal business line (driven from sale of ARWEN products).\nWe expect revenue to ramp up during Fiscal 2023 with the new Canadian Government Contract, coupled with the pending\ncommercial launch of our PARA OPS, scheduled for end of Q3 Fiscal 2023, and full year revenue results from the ARWEN\nproduct line.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit was negligible in Q2 for both Fiscal 2023 and 2022. For YTD Fiscal 2023, we earned $0.2 million or gross\nmargin of 44%, compared to a negligible amount in the same period in 2022. As we are in the pre-revenue stage for most\nproduct lines, we expect continued fluctuation in gross profit / margin during Fiscal 2023 as we ramp up anticipated revenue\nthrough the fiscal year.\nOperating Expenses (“OPEX”)\nTotal OPEX increased by 40% or $0.9 million for the current quarter over the comparable prior period. Excluding the change\nin share-based compensation expense (non-cash item), total OPEX for the quarter increased by $1.2 million or 64%, primarily\nfor the same reasons as noted below the YTD Fiscal 2023.\nTotal OPEX were $4.8 million for YTD Fiscal 2023 compared to $5.4 million in YTD Fiscal 2022. Excluding share-based\ncompensation, total OPEX was $4.5 million compared to $4.1 million, an 11% increase over the comparable prior year due\nto the following factors:\n• G&A increased by $0.6 million, or 27%, primarily due to the retention bonus earned by our former CFO, an increase\nin senior management and directors compensation to be in line with market, higher consulting fees and retention\nbonuses relating key personnel in the non-lethal business line. Additionally, we incurred an increase in D&O\ninsurance, professional fees, and compliance costs due to KWESST’s Nasdaq listing in December 2022 and\nsubsequent regulatory filing compliance.\n• S&M decreased by $0.5 million, or 23%, primarily due to a $0.3 million decrease in share-based compensation\nexpense, coupled with lower U.S. business development consulting costs in YTD Fiscal 2023. This was partially\noffset by an increase in tradeshow spend to promote our products.\n• R&D decreased by $0.7 million, or 55%, primarily due to $0.5 million decrease in share-based compensation\nexpense in YTD Fiscal 2023 in comparison to the comparable prior period. R&D expenses further decreased due to\nreallocating most of our engineering resources to deliver on customer contracts. The related costs are reported as\npart of cost of sales (for delivered performance obligations to customers) and work-in-progress inventories. These\n8 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\ncosts included an average increase in payroll costs of 15% per annum due to the strong local demand for skilled,\nexperienced engineers.\nOther income (expenses), net\nFor Q2 Fiscal 2023, our total other income was $1.8 million, compared to total other expenses of $0.1 million in Q2 Fiscal\n2022. This change in other income (expenses), net is due to the same reason noted below for YTD Fiscal 2023.\nFor YTD Fiscal 2023, our total other income was $1.1 million, compared to total other expenses of $0.1 million. The change\nin other income (expenses), net was driven mainly by the $3.1 million favorable change in fair value of warrant liabilities as\na result of the remeasurement of the warrant liabilities at March 31, 2023, driven by a decrease in the underlying common\nshare price on March 31, 2022. Under IFRS, we are required to remeasure the warrant liabilities at each reporting date until\nthey are exercised or expired. This was partially offset by:\n• $0.6 million increase in net finance costs is primarily due to the recognition of the remaining unamortized accretion\ncosts and interest expense relating to the repayment of all outstanding loans, following the closing of the U.S. IPO\nand Canadian Offering during the quarter;\n• $0.2 million increase in foreign exchange loss due to appreciation in the U.S. currency during the current quarter;\nand\n• $1.3 million in Share Offering Costs relating to the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering. Under IFRS, we are required\nto allocate proportionately the $4.2 million total underwriting and share offering costs (collectively “Share Offering\nCosts”) between equity and warrant liabilities resulting from the U.S. IPO and Canadian offering. The portion of the\nShare Offering Costs allocated to warrant liabilities were expensed.\n9 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\nThe following tables summarize selected results for the eight most recent completed quarters to March 31, 2023 (unaudited).\n2023 2022 2021\n($ in thousands) Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3\nRevenue 161 317 255 282 166 17 160 522\nNet loss (1,227) (2,208) (2,345) (2,600) (2,290) (2,290) (2,884) (2,628)\nNote: due to preparing the table in thousands, there may be rounding differences.\nQuarterly Results Trend Analysis\nThere is no material change to our quarterly results trend from our disclosure in our annual MD&A dated January 27, 2023,\nexcept that we expect further volatility with our quarterly revenue during Fiscal 2023 due to the launch of PARA OPS products\nand anticipated new military contracts, coupled with an increase in operating expenses as highlighted in the Results of\nOperations. Additionally, we expect further volatility with our quarterly net loss due to the remeasurement of warrant\nliabilities at each reporting period, with the change in fair value recorded through P&L.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe following table summarizes our financial position:\nMarch 31, September 30,\n2023 2022\nAssets\nCurrent $ 6,606,399 $ 1,516,393\nNon-current 6,230,088 5,807,070\nTotal assets $ 12,836,487 $ 7,323,463\nLiabilities\nCurrent $ 4,431,602 $ 6,925,880\nNon-current 1,372,338 1,400,474\nTotal liabilities 5,803,940 8,326,354\nNet assets $ 7,032,547 $ (1,002,891)\nWorking capital (1) $ 2,174,797 $ (5,409,487)\n(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.\nOur working capital was $2.2 million at March 31, 2023, an increase of $10.2 million from September 30, 2022. The increase\nwas primarily due to net proceeds from the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, offset partially by repayment of all outstanding\nloans, payments of overdue accounts payables and certain accrued liabilities, and net operating loss for YTD Fiscal 2023.\nCurrent liabilities include warrant liabilities, a non-cash liability item (see Note 12 of Q2 Fiscal 2023). Excluding warrant\nliabilities, working capital would be $4.8 million. These warrant liabilities will be extinguished when the warrants are\nexercised or expired. If exercised, the proceeds will provide us with additional capital to fund our future working capital\nrequirements. There is no assurance that any warrants will be exercised.\nTotal assets increased by $5.5 million from September 30, 2022, mainly due to $5.1 million increase in currents assets from\nnet proceeds of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, offset partially by repayment of all outstanding loans, payments of\noverdue accounts payables and certain accrued liabilities.\n10 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\nTotal liabilities decreased by $2.5 million from September 30, 2022, to $5.8 million at March 31, 2023, mainly due to a\nreduction in current liabilities. While we have significantly paid the outstanding accounts payable and fully repaid all\noutstanding loans during the current quarter, these were offset by the recognition of warrant liabilities at fair value as noted\nabove. As at March 31, 2023, we had $2.6 million of warrant liabilities.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAvailable Liquidity\nOur approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we always have sufficient liquidity to meet our\nliabilities as they come due. We regularly perform cash flow forecasts to ensure that we have sufficient cash to meet our\noperational needs while maintaining sufficient liquidity. At this time, we do not use any derivative financial instruments to\nhedge our currency risk.\nAt March 31, 2023, our cash position was $4 million, an increase of $3.8 million since September 30, 2022 primarily due to\nnet proceeds from the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, offset partially by repayment of all outstanding loans, payments of\noverdue accounts payables and certain accrued liabilities, and net operating loss for YTD Fiscal 2023.\nOn December 9, 2022, we closed both the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering pursuant to which we received aggregate gross\nproceeds of USD$14.1 million (or CAD$19.4 million), before underwriting and offering costs (see below, Capital Resources,\nfor further details including our expected use of proceeds). With the remaining cash position at March 31, 2023, collections\nof outstanding receivables, the new Canadian Government Contract and other anticipated contracts, and the commercial\nlaunch of PARA OPS in Fiscal 2023, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital to timely fund our working capital\nand contractual obligations, over the next twelve months. However, we may require additional capital in the event we fail to\nimplement our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or financial\nperformance. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital as they are required in the future. Potential\nsources of capital may include additional equity and/or debt financings. In our view, the availability of capital will be affected\nby, among other things, capital market conditions, the success of our PARA OPS system commercialization efforts, timing\nfor winning new customer contracts, potential acquisitions, and other relevant considerations (see Risk Factors). In the event\nwe raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our existing shareholders will likely experience dilution, and any\nadditional incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to\noperational and financial covenants that could further restrict our operations. Any failure to raise additional funds on terms\nfavorable to us or at all may require us to significantly change or curtail our current or planned operations in order to conserve\ncash until such time, if ever, that sufficient proceeds from operations are generated, and could result in us not being in a\nposition to advance our commercialization strategy or take advantage of business opportunities.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the respective periods:\nSix months ended March31,\n2023 2022\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ (9,155,294) $ (2,880,326)\nInvesting activities ( 883,852) ( 332,997)\nFinancing acitivities 1 3,852,292 2 ,042,380\nNet cash outflows $ 3,813,146 $ (1,170,943)\nCash, beginning of period 170,545 2 ,688,105\nCash, end of period $ 3,983,691 $ 1,517,162\n11 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\nCash used by operating activities\nCash flow used in operating activities increased by $6.2 million to $9.2 million for the six months March 31, 2023 primarily\ndue to payments on overdue payables as well as unpaid voluntary deferred wages, consulting fees, and bonuses until we\nclosed the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, coupled with significant prepaid expenses during the six months ended March\n31, 2023. Prepaid expenses increased by $1.4 million mainly due to the renewal of D&O and commercial insurance coverage,\nroyalties relating to future Phantom sales, capital market advisory services, and retention bonus for our head of PARA OPS\n(refundable in the event he voluntarily terminates prior to a specified date as set by us).\nCash used by investing activities\nCash flow used in investing activities was $0.9 million for the six months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $0.6 million\nfrom the comparable period, mainly due to additional investment in the product development of our PARA OPS, coupled\nwith additional low-rate initial production equipment for PARA OPS.\nCash provided by financing activities\nCash flow provided by financing activities was $13.9 million in YTD Fiscal 2023 compared to $2 million in Fiscal 2022\nprimarily due to net proceeds generated from the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, partially offset by repayment of all\noutstanding borrowings during the six months ended March 31, 2023.\nCapital Resources\nOur objective in managing our capital is to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern and to sustain future\ndevelopment of the business. Our senior management is responsible for managing the capital through regular review of\nfinancial information to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet operating requirements and investments to support\nits growth strategy. Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing this process. From time to time, we could issue new\ncommon shares or debt to maintain or adjust our capital structure.

The\nWarrants have a per share exercise price of US$5.00, can be exercised immediately, and expire five years from the date of\nissuance. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option to\npurchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share purchase warrants and 375,000 warrants to purchase Common\nShares.

On initial\nrecognition, financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the financial\nassets and liabilities, except for financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, whereby the transactions\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nRefer to Note 17 of the Q2 Fiscal 2023 FS for further disclosure our financial instruments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nRefer to Note 2(f) of the Fiscal 2022 audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting policies and\nestimates that are critical to the understanding of our business operations and the results of our operations.\nOUTSTANDING SHARE INFORMATION\nAt March 31, 2023, KWESST’s authorized capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares with no stated par\nvalue. There were 4,073,106 outstanding and issued common shares as at March 31, 2023.\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nAs a result of our Nasdaq listing on December 6, 2022, KWESST ceased to be a “venture issuer”, resulting in KWESST\nbecoming subject to additional requirements under applicable laws relating to the establishment and maintenance of\ndisclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in National Instrument NI 52-\n109 “Certification of Disclosures in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings” (“NI 52-109”), starting with this interim filing.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, we hired a third party consulting firm to assist management with the review\nand assessment of the following, which remains ongoing and additional matters may come to our attention.\nDisclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”)\nOur CEO and Interim CFO are responsible for establishing and maintaining our DC&P. These DC&P are designed to provide\nreasonable assurance that information required to be publicly disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on\na timely basis. Our CEO and Interim CFO have evaluated the design and effectiveness of our DC&P at the end of the quarter\n14 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\nand based on the evaluation have concluded that, as a result of the material weakness described below, our DC&P were not\neffective as at March 31, 2023.\nWe had an aggregation of deficiencies within our IT general controls across multiple systems, including deficiencies related\nto segregation of duties and user access. As a result, we concluded that the process-level automated and manual controls in\nthe areas of journal entries, revenue and inventory costing that are dependent on IT general controls, information, and data\nderived from affected IT systems were also ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. This material\nweakness creates a reasonable possibility that material misstatements in interim or annual financial statements would not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of the identification of this material weakness, we performed additional\nanalysis and other post-closing procedures.\nInternal controls over financial reporting (“ICFR”)\nOur ICFR are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS. Our management is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining adequate ICFR. Management, including CEO and Interim CFO, does not expect that our ICFR will prevent or\ndetect all errors and all fraud or will be effective under all future conditions. A control system is subject to inherent limitations\nand even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control\nobjectives will be met with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nNI 52-109 requires the CEO and Interim CFO to certify that they are responsible for establishing and maintaining ICFR for\nKWESST and that those internal controls have been designed and are effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Our CEO and Interim\nCFO are also responsible for disclosing any changes to our internal controls during the most recent period that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially effect, our ICFR. Our management under the supervision of our CEO and\nInterim CFO has evaluated the design of our ICFR based on the Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nAs at March 31, 2023, management assessed the design of our ICFR and concluded that our ICFR includes a material\nweakness as previously noted above. To compensate for this material weakness, management continues to perform additional\naccount reconciliations and other analytical and substantive procedures to ensure reliable financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until\nthe applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these\ncontrols are operating effectively.\nRemediation Plan\nAs the conclusion regarding the material weakness was identified late in the quarter, we have not had adequate time to develop\na remediation plan to remedy the material weakness described above. We expect to complete the remediation plan by the end\nof Q3 Fiscal 2023 and remedy the material weakness through the remainder of Fiscal 2023 and into Fiscal 2024 until the\nmaterial weakness is remedied.\nAlthough there can be no assurance that we will timely implement the remediation plan or that additional material weaknesses\nin our ICFR will not be identified in the future, management believes the foregoing efforts will, when implemented, strengthen\nour ICFR and DC&P and effectively remediate the identified material weakness. Management will take additional remedial\nactions as necessary as they continue to evaluate and work to improve KWESST’s ICFR environment.\n15 | Pa ge"

This MD&A has been\nprepared with an effective date of February 28, 2022.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the\nthree months ended December 31, 2021 (“Q1 Fiscal 2022 FS”) and the annual audited consolidated financial statements and\nrelated notes for the year ended September 30, 2021 (“Fiscal 2021 FS”). The financial information presented in this MD&A\nis derived from these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\nThis MD&A contains forward-looking statements involves risk, uncertainties and assumptions, including statements\nregarding anticipated developments in future financial periods and our future plans and objectives. There can be no assurance\nthat such information will prove to be accurate, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking\nstatements. See “Forward-Looking Statements”.\nAll references to $ or dollar amounts in this MD&A are to Canadian currency unless otherwise indicated.\nAdditional information, including press releases, relating to KWESST is available for view on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nIn this MD&A, we have presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA\nthat has been adjusted for the removal of stock-based compensation, foreign exchange loss (gain) and any one-time, irregular\nand nonrecurring items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to provide readers with a supplemental measure of our operating performance\nand thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial\nmeasures. Management also uses non-IFRS measures, in addition to IFRS financial measures, to understand and compare\noperating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting\npurposes, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these non-IFRS financial measures enable us to identify\nunderlying trends in our business that could otherwise be hidden by the effect of certain expenses that we exclude in the\ncalculations of the non-IFRS financial measures.\nAccordingly, we believe that these non-IFRS financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for\nmeaningful comparisons and analysis in the business and provides useful information to investors and securities analysts, and\nother interested parties in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing their overall understanding of our\npast performance and future prospects.\nWe caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures do not replace the presentation of our IFRS financial results and\nshould only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. There\nare limitations in the use of non-IFRS measures because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under\nIFRS as well as they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-IFRS financial\nmeasure. Furthermore, other peers may use other non-IFRS measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-\nIFRS measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as tools for\ncomparison.\nGOING CONCERN\nAs an early-stage company, we have incurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have\nprimarily been funded from financing activities. KWESST’s Q1 Fiscal 2022 FS have been prepared on the “going concern”\nbasis which presumes that KWESST will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of\nbusiness for the foreseeable future.

Forward-\nlooking statements are provided for the purposes of assisting the reader in understanding us, our business, operations,\nprospects and risks at a point in time in the context of historical and possible future developments and therefore the reader is\ncautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.\nForward-looking statements relating to us include, among other things, statements relating to:\n• our expectations regarding our business, financial condition and results of operations;\n• the future state of the legislative and regulatory regimes, both domestic and foreign, in which we conduct business\nand may conduct business in the future;\n• our expansion in domestic and international markets;\n• our ability to attract customers and clients;\n• our marketing and business plans and short-term objectives;\n• our ability to obtain and retain the licences and personnel we require to undertake our business;\n• our strategic relationships with third parties;\n• our anticipated trends and challenges in the markets in which we operate;\n• governance of us as a public company; and\n• expectations regarding future developments of products and our ability to bring these products to market.\nForward-looking statements are based upon a number of assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,\nmany of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those that are disclosed in\nor implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following\nrisk factors, some of which are discussed in greater detail under the section “Risk Factors” in our annual MD&A dated\nNovember 23, 2021.\n• limited operating history;\n• failure to realize growth strategy;\n• failure to complete transactions or realize anticipated benefits;\n• reliance on key personnel;\n• regulatory compliance;\n• competition;\n• changes in laws, regulations and guidelines;\n• demand for our products;\n• fluctuating prices of raw materials;\n• pricing for products;\n• ability to supply sufficient product;\n• expansion to other jurisdictions;\n• damage to our reputation;\n• operating risk and insurance coverage;\n• negative operating cash flow;\n3 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021\n• management of growth;\n• product liability;\n• product recalls;\n• environmental regulations and risks;\n• ownership and protection of intellectual property;\n• constraints on marketing products;\n• reliance on management;\n• fraudulent or illegal activity by our employees, contractors and consultants;\n• breaches of security at our facilities or in respect of electronic documents and data storage and risks related to\nbreaches of applicable privacy laws;\n• government regulations with regards to COVID-19, employee health and safety regulations;\n• the duration and impact of COVID-19, and including variants of COVID-19, on our operations;\n• regulatory or agency proceedings, investigations and audits;\n• additional capital requirements to support our operations and growth plans, leading to further dilution to\nshareholders;\n• conflicts of interest;\n• litigation;\n• risks related to United States’ and other international activities;\n• risks related to security clearances and risks relating to the ownership of KWESST common shares (“Common\nShares”) such as potential volatility of share price; and\n• no assurance of active market for Common Shares.\nAlthough the forward-looking statements contained herein are based upon what we believe are reasonable assumptions,\ninvestors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on this information since actual results may vary from the forward-\nlooking statements. Certain assumptions were made in preparing the forward-looking statements concerning availability of\ncapital resources, business performance, market conditions and customer demand.\n4 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nCorporate Information\nWe are an early commercial-stage defense technology company focused on the development and commercialization of next-\ngeneration tactical systems that meet the requirements of security forces and personal defense for overmatch capability against\nadversaries.\nKey market segments and solutions addressed by our technologies are:\n(i) breakthrough technology in non-lethal systems with broad application, including law enforcement and personal\ndefense,\n(ii) modernized digitization of tactical forces for shared situational awareness and targeting, and\n(iii) counter-measures against threats such as drones, lasers and electronic detection.\nFor more details on KWESST products and markets, refer to the amended Annual Information Form dated April 15, 2021.\nThis document and other information about KWESST are available on SEDAR under the Company’s profile at\nwww.sedar.com.\nMajor Highlights – Q1 Fiscal 2022\nThe following is a summary of the major highlights that occurred during Q1 Fiscal 2022:\n• On October 13, 2021, we announced that we are accelerating the readiness of deployable and man-wearable\nBattlefield Laser Detection System (“BLDS”) for first deliveries available by end of Q1 Fiscal 2022, following\nmilitary interest from a number of NATO land and Special Operation Forces at the signature European defense\nshow, DESI, which took place in London, UK, on September 13 to 18, 2021. While no deliveries took place in Q1\nFiscal 2022, we are in active discussion for a first order with an overseas NATO country for two vehicle-mounted\nversions of the BLDS for Special Forces light patrol vehicles.\n• On November 12, 2021, we announced that General Dynamics Land Systems (“GDLS”) has selected KWESST’s\nPhantomTM electronic battlefield decoy as part of its ongoing efforts to develop a next generation multi-million\ndomain mobile capability at the tactical level. If GLDS wins the contract with their United States military customer,\nwe have estimated the potential value for this contract to KWESST could be more than USD $40 million, depending\non the number of PhantomTM units per military vehicle. The United States military customer will announce the\nwinner of the tender for 400-500 next generation military vehicles in calendar 2023.\n• On November 15, 2021, we conducted live fire demonstration of our initial non-lethal cartridge-based personal\ndefence products for investors near Toronto, Ontario, including an opportunity for these investors to use the devices.\nFurther, on January 14, 2022, we announced the launching of our non-lethal cartridge-based products under the\nbrand PARA OPSTM at the 2022 SHOT Show in Las Vegas held on January 18th to 21st 2022.\n• On November 23, 2021, in connection with an updated capital markets strategy, we submitted our initial application\nto list on The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”). We believe that, if successful, a Nasdaq listing can broaden investor\nawareness to the market for KWESST’s common shares, with a view to supporting shareholder value.\n• On December 2, 2021, we announced that we have engaged the New York-based public relations firm AMW Public\nRelations to lead our public relations, brand strategy, and media communication initiatives.\n5 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021\n• On December 8, 2021, our United States military customer accepted the delivery of the final milestone of the US\n$0.8 million relating to the integration of our TASCS IFM with 81 mortar system. Final payment was received in\nJanuary 2022. While we expect follow-on customer orders for this solution during Fiscal 2022, there is no assurance\nof such orders.\n• On December 14 and 16, 2021, we announced that we signed a Master Services Agreement with General Dynamics\nMission Systems – Canada (“GDMS”) to support the development of digitization solutions for future Canadian land\nC4ISR programs. We estimated this contract to be up to $1 million over the next 12 months.\n• On December 15, 2021, we completed the non-cash acquisition of Police Ordnance Company Inc. – see below\n“Acquisition” for further details. On January 10, 2022, we announced that Police Ordnance Company Inc. received\norders from law enforcement agencies for approximately $0.4 million in ARWEN products, all expected to be\ndelivered by the end of Q2 Fiscal 2022.\nUpdate on COVID-19\nWhile COVID-19 has not had a material impact to our business to date, the following is a summary of what we believe may\nimpact our future business given the persistency of COVID-19: disruptions to business operations resulting from quarantines\nof employees, customers, manufacturers and other third-party service providers in areas affected by the outbreak; disruptions\nto business operations resulting from travel restrictions, including travel to industry tradeshows; and uncertainty around the\nduration of the virus' impact.\nDespite the global vaccination efforts underway, the extent to which COVID-19 could impact our operations, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and cash flows is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Negative financial results,\nuncertainties in the market, and a tightening of credit markets, caused by COVID-19, or a recession, could have a material\nadverse effect on our liquidity and ability to obtain financing in the future.\nACQUISITION\nTo accelerate our growth plans and respond to market opportunities, we have made the following acquisition during Q1 Fiscal\n2022.\nPolice Ordnance\nOn December 15, 2021, we acquired 2720178 Ontario Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation, which owns all of the issued\nand outstanding shares of Police Ordnance Company Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation (together, “Police Ordnance”),\nherein referred as the “Police Ordnance Acquisition”. Located in Bowmanville, Ontario, with ancillary operations in Florida,\nPolice Ordnance owns all intellectual properties to the ARWEN product line of less-lethal launchers, and a proprietary line\nof 37 mm less-lethal cartridges designed for riot control and tactical teams. Police Ordnance has law enforcement customers\nacross Canada, the United States, and abroad. The Police Ordnance Acquisition provides us with a strategic opportunity to\nleverage its law enforcement customer base to accelerate growth within our specialty ordnance business.\nThe fair value of the purchase consideration was $592,822, which comprised of: (i) 277,576 Common Shares, (ii) 200,000\nCommon Share purchase warrants exercisable at a price of $1.72 per share and expiring on December 15, 2024; and (ii)\n61,264 Common Shares contingent on fulfilment of a financial milestone (refer to Note 4 of the Q1 Fiscal 2022 FS for further\nfinancial information). While this acquisition is expected to be accretive annually based on historical results, we do not expect\nit will have a material impact to our overall consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows over the\nnext twelve months.\n6 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following selected financial data has been extracted from Q1 Fiscal 2022 FS.\nThree months ended December 31,\n(Unaudited) 2021 2020\n(Adjusted)(1)\nRevenue $ 17,465 $ 146,349\nCost of sales (25,479) (71,564)\nGross profit (8,014) 74,785\nGross margin % -45.9% 51.1%\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and administrative 1,055,140 539,631\nSelling and marketing 1,346,391 534,863\nR&D 794,412 505,247\nTotal operating expenses 3,195,943 1,579,741\nOperating loss (3,203,957) (1,504,956)\nOther income (expenses)\nNet finance costs (47,642) (17,948)\nForeign exchange gain (loss) 8,745 (3,385)\nNet loss $ (3,242,854) $ (1,526,289)\nEBITDA loss $ (3,123,175) $ (1,469,607)\nAdjusted EBITDA loss(2) $ (2,204,390) $ (1,192,607)\nLoss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.07) $ (0.04)\nWeighted average common shares - basic 49,022,129 41,392,149\n(2) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measures.

The significant increase in share-based\ncompensation in Q1 Fiscal 2022 compared to the same quarter in Fiscal 2021 is mainly due to granting a higher volume of\noptions at a higher fair value per option for recruiting and retaining directors, executives and key business consultants.\nRevenue and Gross Profit\n2020 to\nThree months ended December 31, 2021\n(Unaudited) 2021 2020 %\nDigitization and counter threat systems $ 16,640 $ 1 38,934 -88%\nOther 825 7 ,415 -89%\nTotal revenue $ 17,465 $ 146,349 -88%\nGross profit $ (8,014) $ 74,785\nGross margin -45.9% 51.1%\nTotal revenue declined by 88% during Q1 Fiscal 2022 compared to same quarter in Fiscal 2021 mainly due to the completion\nof the USD$0.8 million military contract, awarded in December 2020, during the quarter where we recognized the remaining\n2.7% of the total revenue. While we won a new contract with GDMS in December 2021 (see Business Overview section of\nthis MD&A), we began delivering on this contract only from Q2 Fiscal 2022. We expect revenue to ramp up over the next\nfew quarters with new military contracts, coupled with the official launch of our PARA OPSTM product line in January 2022\nfor non-lethal personal defense, with low-rate initial production (“LRIP”) shipments expected to commence in April 2022\nsubject to timely receipt of ATF classification. We anticipate transitioning from LRIP to full production with strategic\npartners by the end of summer 2022.\nThe negative gross profit in Q1 Fiscal 2022 is largely due to final adjustment to estimated costs incurred relating to the above\ncontract for the United States military contract. Our gross profit will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter with the\nanticipated new product mix and sales volume.\nOperating Expenses (OPEX)\n2020 to\nThree months ended December 31, 2021\n(Unaudited) 2021 2020 %\n(Adjusted)(1)\nGeneral and administrative $ 1,055,140 $ 539,631 96%\nSelling and marketing 1,346,391 534,863 152%\nResearch and development 794,412 505,247 57%\nTotal operating expenses $ 3,195,943 $ 1,579,741 102%\n8 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021\nOverall, our OPEX increased by 102% or $1.6 million for the current quarter over the comparable prior period, including\n$0.7 million of additional share-based compensation (non-cash item) or 40 percentage points of the total increase. The\nincrease in OPEX was driven primarily by:\n• G&A increased by 96% or $0.5 million primarily due to augmenting the senior management team with two full-\ntime executives and recruiting independent directors and other staff, which led to an increase in total personnel costs\nincluding $0.2 million of additional share-based compensation over Q1 Fiscal 2021. Additionally, in the current\nquarter we incurred $0.2 million in professional fees in connection with our Nasdaq application and the preparation\nof the Registration Statement filing with the SEC.\n• S&M increased by 152% or $0.8 million primarily due to making a significant investment in promoting and\nincreasing awareness about us and our product offerings, including attending two investor conferences in the United\nStates and engaging strategic advisors. This included The Officer Tatum LLC who joined us in July 2021 as our\nstrategic advisor and advocate for our non-lethal PARA OPSTM product line for law enforcement and personal\ndefense in the United States; the STRYK Group in September 2021 to assist us with the commercialization of our\nPARA OPSTM product line including a new website (www.para-ops.com); and AMW Public Relations in November\n2021 to lead our United States public relations, brand strategy and media communications initiatives. The increase\nin S&M includes $0.3 million of additional share-based compensation in lieu of cash consideration to certain\nstrategic advisors.\n• R&D increased by 57% or $0.3 million primarily due to an increase in headcount to accelerate product development.\nThe increase in personnel costs included $0.2 million of additional share-based compensation over Q1 Fiscal 2021.\nNet Finance Costs\nTotal finance costs for Q1 Fiscal 2022 were $47,642, a 165% increase over the comparable prior period primarily due to the\naccretion cost relating to accrued royalties payable to DEFSEC Corporation for the acquisition of the technology known at\nthe time as the Low Energy Cartridge system, branded as PARA OPSTM.\n9 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\nThe following tables summarize selected results for the eight most recent completed quarters to December 31, 2021\n(unaudited).\nMarch 2021 June 2021 September 2021 December 2021\n($ in thousands, except per share) (Q2 FY21) (Q3 FY21) (Q4 FY21) (Q1 FY22)\nRevenue $ 448 $ 522 $ 160 $ 17\nCost of sales $ 332 $ 315 $ 80 $ 25\nGross profit $ 116 $ 207 $ 80 $ (8)\nGross margin % 26.0% 39.6% 49.7% -45.9%\nOperating expenses $ 2,376 $ 2,798 $ 2,925 $ 3,196\nOperating loss $ (2,260) $ (2,591) $ (2,845) $ (3,204)\nOther income (expenses) $ (17) $ (37) $ (38) $ (39)\nNet loss $ 2,277 $ 2,628 $ 2,883 $ 3,243\nNet finance costs $ 15 $ 28 $ 19 $ 48\nDepreciation and amortization $ 35 $ 13 $ 53 $ 72\nEBITDA loss $ 2,227 $ 2,587 $ 2,811 $ 3,123\nAdjusted EBITDA loss $ 1,627 $ 2,017 $ 1,831 $ 2,204\nLoss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.05) $ (0.06) $ (0.06) $ (0.07)\nWeighted average common shares - basic 42,141,523 46,016,645 47,745,525 49,022,129\nMarch 2020 June 2020 September 2020 December 2020\n($ in thousands, except per share) (Q2 FY20) (Q3 FY20) (Q4 FY20) (Q1 FY21)\nRevenue $ 49 $ 600 $ 213 $ 146\nCost of sales $ 8 $ 144 $ 95 $ 72\nGross profit $ 41 $ 456 $ 118 $ 74\nGross margin % 83.4% 76.1% 55.1% 55.1%\nOperating expenses $ 632 $ 1,048 $ 2,392 $ 1,580\nOperating loss $ (591) $ (626) $ (2,274) $ (1,506)\nOther income (expenses) $ (108) $ (186) $ 248 $ (21)\nNet loss $ 699 $ 812 $ 2,026 $ 1,527\nNet finance costs $ 25 $ 91 $ (45) $ 18\nDepreciation and amortization $ 34 $ 69 $ 15 $ 39\nEBITDA loss $ 640 $ 652 $ 2,056 $ 1,470\nAdjusted EBITDA loss $ 539 $ 392 $ 573 $ 1,193\nLoss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.02) $ (0.03) $ (0.07) $ (0.04)\nWeighted average common shares - basic 28,695,065 30,393,359 33,024,736 41,392,149\nQuarterly Results Trend Analysis\nThere is no material change to our quarterly results trend from our disclosure in our annual MD&A dated November 23,\n2021, except that we expect further volatility with our quarterly revenue during Fiscal 2022 due to the launch of PARA\nOPSTM products, the Police Ordnance Acquisition, and anticipated new military contracts.\n10 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table summarizes our financial position:\nDecember 31, September 30,\n(Unaudited) 2021 2021\nAssets\nCurrent $ 2 ,209,012 $ 4 ,055,697\nNon-current 4 ,944,500 4 ,662,149\nTotal assets $ 7 ,153,512 $ 8 ,717,846\nLiabilities\nCurrent $ 1 ,342,153 $ 1 ,159,490\nNon-current 1 ,402,914 1 ,434,628\nTotal liabilities 2 ,745,067 2 ,594,118\nNet assets $ 4 ,408,445 $ 6 ,123,728\nWorking capital (1) $ 866,859 $ 2,896,207\nOur working capital was $0.9 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $2.0 million from September 30, 2021. This\ndecrease was mainly driven by our net operating loss for the current quarter, which was partially offset by the net assets\nassumed in the Police Ordnance Acquisition.\nTotal assets decreased by $1.6 million from September 30, 2021, mainly due to $1.8 million decrease in currents assets driven\nby the $1.9 million net use of cash to fund our operating activities, net by the assets assumed in the Police Ordnance\nAcquisition. This was partially offset by an increase of $0.3 million in non-current assets, largely due to the increase in\nintangible assets from capitalized development costs for our PhantomTM and PARA OPSTM systems and acquired intangible\nassets from Police Ordnance.\nTotal liabilities increased by $0.2 million from September 30, 2021, mainly due to additional liabilities from the Police\nOrdnance Acquisition.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary sources of capital to date have been from security offerings, exercise of stock options and warrants, and, to a\nlesser extent, pre-commercial revenue. At December 31, 2021, our cash position was $0.7 million, a decrease of $2.0 million\nsince September 30, 2021 primarily due to incurring a net operating loss for Q1 Fiscal 2022, offset by an increase in cash of\n$0.2 million from the Police Ordnance Acquisition.\nWhile we are confident we will be awarded additional customer contracts in Fiscal 2022, we expect additional capital will be\nrequired to initially fund these potential contracts, our commercialization efforts in the United States for the launch of the\nPara OPSTM system, R&D activities and our working capital requirements over the next twelve months. Potential sources of\ncapital may include additional equity and/or debt financings, Canadian ITCs for SR&ED activities, and other government\nfunding such as Innovation Solutions Canada. Based on management’s current projection, the minimum additional funding\n11 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021\nrequired to remain in business for at least the next 12 months is approximately $8 million. While we are currently in active\ndiscussions with current and prospective investors, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the capital\nsufficient to meet any or all of our needs. In our view, the availability of capital will be affected by, among other things,\ncapital market conditions, the success of our PARA OPSTM system commercialization efforts, timing for winning new\ncustomer contracts, potential acquisitions, and other relevant considerations. In the event we raise additional funds by issuing\nequity securities, our existing shareholders will likely experience dilution, and any additional incurrence of indebtedness\nwould result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operational and financial covenants that\ncould further restrict our operations. Any failure to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all may require us to\nsignificantly change or curtail our current or planned operations in order to conserve cash until such time, if ever, that\nsufficient proceeds from operations are generated, and could result in us not being in a position to advance our\ncommercialization strategy or take advantage of business opportunities.\nCash Flows\nOur approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we always have sufficient liquidity to meet our\nliabilities as they come due. We regularly perform cash flow forecasts to ensure that we have sufficient cash to meet our\noperational needs while maintaining sufficient liquidity. At this time, we do not use any derivative financial instruments to\nhedge our currency risk.\nThe following table summarizes KWESST’s consolidated statements of cash flows for the respective periods:\nThree months ended December 31,\n(Unaudited) 2021 2020\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ ( 1,864,760) $ ( 1,229,876)\nInvesting activities (68,960) ( 329,316)\nFinancing acitivities (20,401) 186,795\nNet cash outflows $ ( 1,954,121) $ ( 1,372,397)\nCash, beginning of period 2,688,105 3,073,760\nCash, end of period $ 733,984 $ 1,701,363\nCash used by operating activities\nWith the additional capital raised during Fiscal 2021, we continued to invest significantly across the organization and product\ndevelopment. As an early-stage company with various products in the pipeline (pre-commercialization phase), our revenue\nremains low and insufficient to cover the increase in our overhead costs, professional fees, advertising and promotion costs,\nand R&D costs. As a result, cash flow used in operating activities was $1.9 million for Q1 Fiscal 2022, compared to $1.2\nmillion in the comparable prior quarter.\nCash used by investing activities\nCash flow used in investing activities decreased in Q1 Fiscal 2022 compared to Q1 Fiscal 2021 mainly due to $0.2 million\nnet cash acquired from the Police Ordnance Acquisition, coupled with lower capitalized development costs.\nCash provided by financing activities\nThe $0.2 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities in Q1 Fiscal 2022 over Q1 Fiscal 2021 was primarily\ndriven by no exercise of options in the current quarter.\n12 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021\nCapital Management\nOur objective in managing our capital is to safeguard KWESST’s ability to continue as a going concern and to sustain future\ndevelopment of the business. KWESST senior management is responsible for managing the capital through regular review\nof financial information to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet operating requirements and investments to support\nits growth strategy. The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing this process. From time to time, we could issue new\ncommon shares or debt to maintain or adjust our capital structure. We are not subject to any externally imposed capital\nrequirements.\nKWESST’s capital is composed of the following:\nDecember 31, September 30,\n(Unaudited) 2021 2021\nDebt:\nLease obligations $ 307,741 $ 307,909\nBorrowings 80,783 53,251\nEquity:\nShare capital 17,668,904 17,215,068\nContingent shares 83,319 -\nWarrants 1,920,389 1,848,389\nContributed surplus 3,373,241 2,458,211\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (5,605) (8,991)\nAccumulated deficit (18,631,803) (15,388,949)\nTotal capital $ 4,796,969 $ 6,484,888\nAt December 31, 2021, our contractual obligations and commitments were as follows:\nPayment due: Total Within 1 Year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years\nMinimum royalty commitments $ 2,500,000 $ - $ 150,000 $ 2,350,000\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 1,180,189 1,180,189 - -\nLease obligations 382,200 78,000 187,200 117,000\nShort-term rental obligations 25,938 25,938 - -\nOther commitments 50,712 50,712 - -\nBorrowings 90,000 30,000 60,000 -\nTotal contractual obligations $ 4,229,039 $ 1,364,839 $ 397,200 $ 2,467,000\nEquity\nDuring Q1 Fiscal 2022, we issued 277,576 common shares and 200,000 warrants exercisable at $1.72 each to the selling\nshareholders of Police Ordnance. These warrants will expire on December 15, 2024. Additionally, we issued 250,000\ncommon shares in connection with the exercise of 250,000 warrants issued as part of the GhostStep technology acquisition\nin Fiscal 2020. This was a cashless exercise to settle the annual fee payable on December 31, 2021, to SageGuild LLC (the\nseller of the GhostStep technology).\n13 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our results\nof operations, financial condition, revenues or expenses, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nRefer to Note 9 of Q1 Fiscal 2022 FS for disclosure about KWESST’s related party transactions conducted in the normal\ncourse of business.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS\nWe recognize financial assets and liabilities when we become party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

This MD&A has been prepared\nwith an effective date of May 27, 2022.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the\nthree and six months ended March 31, 2022 (“Q2 Fiscal 2022 FS”) and the annual audited consolidated financial statements\nand related notes for the year ended September 30, 2021 (“Fiscal 2021 FS”). The financial information presented in this\nMD&A is derived from these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\nThis MD&A contains forward-looking statements involves risk, uncertainties and assumptions, including statements\nregarding anticipated developments in future financial periods and our future plans and objectives. There can be no assurance\nthat such information will prove to be accurate, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking\nstatements. See “Forward-Looking Statements”.\nAll references to $ or dollar amounts in this MD&A are to Canadian currency unless otherwise indicated.\nAdditional information, including press releases, relating to KWESST is available for view on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nIn this MD&A, we have presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA\nthat has been adjusted for the removal of stock-based compensation, foreign exchange loss (gain) and any one-time, irregular\nand nonrecurring items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to provide readers with a supplemental measure of our operating performance\nand thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial\nmeasures. Management also uses non-IFRS measures, in addition to IFRS financial measures, to understand and compare\noperating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting\npurposes, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these non-IFRS financial measures enable us to identify\nunderlying trends in our business that could otherwise be hidden by the effect of certain expenses that we exclude in the\ncalculations of the non-IFRS financial measures.\nAccordingly, we believe that these non-IFRS financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for\nmeaningful comparisons and analysis in the business and provides useful information to investors and securities analysts, and\nother interested parties in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing their overall understanding of our\npast performance and future prospects.\nWe caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures do not replace the presentation of our IFRS financial results and\nshould only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. There\nare limitations in the use of non-IFRS measures because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under\nIFRS as well as they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-IFRS financial\nmeasure. Furthermore, other peers may use other non-IFRS measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-\nIFRS measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as tools for\ncomparison.\nGOING CONCERN\nAs an early-stage company, we have incurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have\nprimarily been funded from financing activities. KWESST’s Q2 Fiscal 2022 FS have been prepared on the “going concern”\nbasis which presumes that KWESST will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of\nbusiness for the foreseeable future.

(“Police Ordnance”) in December 2021 (see Acquisition\nsection of this MD&A), we shipped $0.1 million of ARWENTM products during the quarter. However, as most of\nthe shipments related to open customer orders at acquisition date, these were not recorded as revenue during the\nquarter but rather as a reduction of intangible assets in accordance with IFRS.\n• At the 2022 SHOT Show held in Las Vegas from January 18th to 21st 2022, we showcased our initial PARA OPSTM\nsingle shot device. Since this event, we have continued to make further improvements to this device based on\npositive feedback from the SHOT Show. As of the date of this MD&A, we have finalized the design of the single\nshot device and are in the process of producing small quantities for market testing prior to commercial launch this\nsummer. We are also in the process of optimizing the design of our multi-shot device for market testing in June\n2022 and commercial launch soon after. Our initial sales focus will be law enforcements (see below Government\nRegulations Update).\n• On February 11, 2022, we filed U.S. patent application No. 17/669,420 claiming priority to a provisional patent\nserial 63/148,163 by the USPO for our PARA OPSTM system.\n• On March 11, 2022, we closed a non-secured and non-convertible loan financing with a syndicate of lenders in an\naggregate amount of $1.8 million and an additional $0.2 million on March 15, 2022, for a total of $2.0 million (the\n“Unsecured Loans”). Our directors and officers participated in the amount of $74,000. See Liquidity and Capital\nResources section of this MD&A for further information.\n• On March 29, 2022, the Common Shares commenced trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol\n“62U”. We believe this listing will provide us with the opportunity to further increase our investor base globally,\nimprove our stock liquidity, and promote KWESST to the European financial markets.\nThe following is a summary of the major highlights that occurred since Q2 Fiscal 2022:\n• We announced on April 4, 2022, with the war in Ukraine, that we are currently actioning a number of NATO and\nnon-NATO country requests for quotations of our PhantomTM electronic decoy and laser detection products. While\nwe are confident that this activity will generate sales orders before the end of Fiscal 2022, there is no assurance that\nwe will be successful.\n• On April 22, 2022, we issued 61,264 common shares to the selling shareholders of Police Ordnance as a result of\nachieving the performance milestone as defined in the share purchase agreement.\n• On April 25, 2022, we announced that we engaged RedChip Companies (“RedChip”) to lead our investor relations\nefforts in the United States, in advance of our pending Nasdaq listing (refer to our press release dated November\n23, 2021). Headquartered in Orlando, Florida, RedChip provides investor relations, financial media, and research\nfor microcap and small-cap stocks.\n5 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2022\nGovernment Regulations Update\nPublic Safety Products\nIn February 2022, we retained Orchid Advisors (“Orchid”) to assist us with the classification for our PARA OPSTM devices\nand compliance with the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (“ATF”). Orchid is a Federal\nFirearms License (“FFL”) Compliance Solutions firm headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut.\nBased on Orchid’s interpretation of the ATF rules and regulations, we have self-classified the .67 caliber version of the PARA\nOPSTM devices as “Destructive Devices” (see below), providing us with the ability to go to market much sooner than waiting\nfor ATF classification ruling. Under the ATF rules, a manufacturer must determine whether the device is a firearm and\ntherefore be subject to ATF regulation and if it is a firearm whether it is subject to National Firearms Act of 1934 (“NFA”)\nregulations.\nTo be considered a regulated firearm in the United States, the device must be: (1) a weapon that (2) will or is designed to\nexpel a projectile (3) by the action of an explosive. Although primers in ammunition cartridges are exempted from control\nunder the explosives regulations as administered by ATF, they are still considered an “explosive” for the purposes of the\nfirearm definition. Because we currently use primers in the ammunition cartridges for our PARA OPSTM devices, we have\ndecided to self-classify our PARA OPSTM devices as a form of firearm pending any different eventual classification by the\nATF.\nAs the PARA OPSTM is identified as a firearm, it must be determined whether an additional level of control is imposed by\nthe NFA. Under NFA regulations, there are only two possible types of NFA firearm that PARA OPSTM could be defined as:\n(1) “any other weapon” (“AOW”) or 2) a “destructive device”. Sale of either of these to consumers is permissible but requires\na lengthy approval process conducted by the ATF (the background check process on the consumer); whereas sale to law\nenforcement agencies, military bodies, or government agencies is a more expedient approval process (usually less than 7\ndays). Further, the AOW classification requires only a $5 transfer tax to consumers whereas a destructive device classification\nresults in a $200 transfer tax to consumers (such tax being borne by the consumer). While the velocity for our PARA OPSTM\nprojectile is well below lethal threshold, we have determined that the current version of our PARA OPSTM devices are\ndestructive devices because the measurement of the bore of our device is currently in excess of the one-half inch in diameter\n(maximum size for AOW).\nAs a result, the initial sale of our PARA OPSTM devices are expected to come primarily from law enforcement agencies until\nwe reduce the bore of our device to less than one-half inch in diameter, which is expected to be completed by August 2022.\nWe expect to partner with an FFL manufacturer for the production of our PARA OPSTM in the United States by the end of\nour Q3 Fiscal 2022. We are currently developing a variant of our PARA OPSTM device to meet the AOW firearm classification\nin order to reduce the tax burden on a consumer purchasing the PARA OPSTM devices. We expect to commercially launch\nthis AOW variant by summer 2022. The distribution of our PARA OPSTM products in the United States will be done directly\nwith FFL distributors/firearm dealers for civilian sales. Today, all 50 states of the United States allow civilians to own a\nfirearm subject to the firearm laws of the state (which vary by state). We expect the sales of our PARA OPSTM devices will\nposition us well for significant recurring revenues through the sale of subsequent ammunition over the next 12 months.\nCOVID-19 Update\nWhile COVID-19 has not had a material impact to our business to date, the following is a summary of what we believe may\nimpact our future business given the persistence of COVID-19: disruptions to business operations resulting from quarantine\nof employees, customers, manufacturers and other third-party service providers in areas affected by the outbreak; disruptions\nto business operations resulting from travel restrictions, including travel to industry tradeshows; and uncertainty around the\nduration of the virus' impact.\nDespite the global vaccination efforts underway, the extent to which COVID-19 could impact our operations, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and cash flows is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Negative financial results,\nuncertainties in the market, and a tightening of credit markets, caused by COVID-19, or a recession, could have a material\nadverse effect on our liquidity and ability to obtain financing in the future.\n6 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2022\nACQUISITION\nTo accelerate our growth plans and respond to market opportunities, we made the following acquisition during the first quarter\nof Fiscal 2022.\nPolice Ordnance\nOn December 15, 2021, we acquired 2720178 Ontario Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation, which owns all of the issued\nand outstanding shares of Police Ordnance Company Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation (together, “Police Ordnance”),\nherein referred as the “Police Ordnance Acquisition”. Located in Bowmanville, Ontario, with ancillary operations in Florida,\nPolice Ordnance owns all intellectual properties to the ARWEN product line of launchers, and a proprietary line of 37 mm\ncartridges designed for riot control and tactical teams. Police Ordnance has law enforcement customers across Canada, the\nUnited States, and abroad. The Police Ordnance Acquisition provides us with a strategic opportunity to leverage its law\nenforcement customer base to accelerate growth within our non-lethal public safety business.\nThe fair value of the purchase consideration was $592,822, which comprised of: (i) 277,576 Common Shares, (ii) 200,000\nCommon Share purchase warrants exercisable at a price of $1.72 per share and expiring on December 15, 2024; and (ii)\n61,264 Common Shares contingent on fulfilment of a financial milestone which was achieved in April 2022 (refer to Note 4\nof the Q2 Fiscal 2022 FS for further financial information). While this acquisition is expected to be accretive annually based\non historical results, we do not expect it will have a material impact to our overall consolidated results of operations, financial\ncondition, and/or cash flows over the next twelve months.\n7 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2022\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following selected financial data has been extracted from Q2 Fiscal 2022 FS.\nThree months ended March 31, Six months ended March 31,\n(Unaudited) 2022 2021(1) 2022 2021(1)\nRevenue $ 166,251 $ 447,684 $ 183,716 $ 594,033\nCost of sales (142,012) (331,472) (167,491) (403,036)\nGross profit 24,239 116,212 16,225 190,997\nGross margin % 14.6% 26.0% 8.8% 32.2%\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and administrative 1,033,017 1,132,730 2,088,157 1,672,363\nSelling and marketing 733,364 778,523 2,079,755 1,313,384\nR&D 465,344 464,842 1,259,756 970,089\nTotal operating expenses 2,231,725 2,376,095 5,427,668 3,955,836\nOperating loss (2,207,486) (2,259,883) (5,411,443) (3,764,839)\nOther expenses\nNet finance costs (72,479) (15,129) (120,121) (33,077)\nForeign exchange loss (9,044) (1,776) (299) (5,164)\nLoss on disposals (1,165) - (1,165) -\nNet loss $ (2,290,174) $ (2,276,788) $ (5,533,028) $ (3,803,080)\nEBITDA loss $ (2,144,546) $ (2,225,348) $ (5,267,721) $ (3,694,958)\nAdjusted EBITDA loss(2) $ (1,711,406) $ (1,618,729) $ (3,915,796) $ (2,811,336)\nLoss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.05) $ (0.05) $ (0.11) $ (0.09)\nWeighted average common shares - basic 49,868,065 42,141,523 49,440,449 41,813,109\n(1) See Note 2(f) of the Q2 Fiscal 2022 FS.\n(2) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measures.

While the results Q2\nFiscal 2022 remained consistent with the comparable prior period, the YTD Fiscal 2022 net loss increased by $1.7 million\n8 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2022\nover the comparable prior period, primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses driven by higher headcount\nand related share-based awards, increased efforts in research and development of product and service offerings, investment\nin promoting and advertising our company and products, and to a lesser extent additional professional fees relating to our\nNasdaq listing application and Registration Statement to be filed with the United States Securities Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”).\nShare-based compensation accounted for most of the adjustments to EBITDA. The decrease in share-based compensation in\nQ2 Fiscal 2022 compared to the same quarter in Fiscal 2021 is mainly due to amortizing a higher volume of options at a\nhigher fair value per option in Q2 Fiscal 2021 for recruiting and retaining directors, executives and key business consultants.\nHowever, we had an increase in share-based compensation for the YTD Fiscal 2022 compared to the same period in Fiscal\n2021 primarily due to amortization on stock units issued to key business consultants in Q4 Fiscal 2021 and Q1 Fiscal 2022.\nOn March 31, 2022, the independent directors of the Board (the “Independent Directors”) approved the grant of 600,000\nperformance stock units (“PSUs”) to each David Luxton (Executive Chairman) and Jeffrey MacLeod (President and CEO),\nfor which the vesting of these PSUs is subject to achieving performance milestones as set by our Independent Directors.\nAmortization of these PSUs begins only when it is probable that the milestones will be achieved.\nRevenue and Gross Profit\nThree months ended March 31, Change Six months ended March 31, Change\n(Unaudited) 2022 2021 % 2022 2021 %\nDigitization and counter-threat systems $ 139,975 $ 444,208 -68% $ 156,615 $ 583,141 -73%\nPublic safety product sales 10,492 - N/A 10,492 - N/A\nTraining and services 15,674 - N/A 15,674 - N/A\nOther 110 3,476 -97% 935 10,892 -91%\nTotal revenue $ 166,251 $ 447,684 -63% $ 183,716 $ 594,033 -69%\nGross profit $ 24,239 $ 116,212 $ 16,225 $ 190,997\nGross margin 14.6% 26.0% 8.8% 32.2%\nTotal revenue declined by 63% and 69% during Q2 Fiscal 2022 and YTD Fiscal 2022, respectively, compared to same period\nin Fiscal 2021. The above revenue table excludes $0.1 million for deliveries of public safety products in relation to open\ncustomer orders at the closing of the Police Ordnance Acquisition which were recognized as a reduction of intangible assets.\nRevenue for Digitization and Counter-Threat product lines declined by 68% and 73% for Q2 Fiscal 2022 and YTD Fiscal\n2022, respectively, primarily due to the timing of expected contracts and a smaller contract awarded by General Dynamic\nMission Systems Canada in Q1 Fiscal 2022, compared to the US$0.8 million contract awarded by a US military customer in\nthe same quarter in Fiscal 2021 delivered throughout Fiscal 2021.\nWe expect revenue to ramp up over the next few quarters with new anticipated military contracts, coupled with the pending\ncommercial launch of our PARA OPSTM, with low-rate initial production (“LRIP”) shipments of the PARA OPS products\nexpected to commence in July 2022. We anticipate transitioning from LRIP to full production with strategic manufacturing\nand distribution partners by the end of summer 2022.\nGross margin was lower for the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, compared to the same prior periods, primarily\ndue to negative gross margin earned on training and services on ARWENTM products provided to law enforcement agencies\nduring Q2 Fiscal 2022 to drive business development for future sales opportunities, which resulted in additional orders during\nQ3 Fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of this negative margin on training and services on the ARWENTM products, our gross\nmargin would have been 40% and 31% for Q2 Fiscal 2022 and YTD Fiscal 2022, respectively.

The increase was\ndriven by the following factors:\n• G&A increased by 25% or $0.4 million primarily due to augmenting the senior management team with two full-\ntime executives and recruiting independent directors and other staff, which led to an increase in total personnel costs\nincluding $0.1 million of additional share-based compensation over YTD Fiscal 2021. Additionally, we incurred\n$0.2 million in professional fees in connection with our Nasdaq listing application and the preparation of a\nRegistration Statement to be filed with the SEC.\n• S&M increased by 58% or $0.8 million primarily due to making a significant investment in promoting and increasing\nawareness about us and our product offerings, including attending two investor conferences in the United States and\nengaging strategic advisors during Fiscal 2022. This included The Officer Tatum LLC who joined us in July 2021\nas our strategic advisor and advocate for our PARA OPSTM product line for law enforcement and personal defense\nin the United States; the engagement of STRYK Group in September 2021 to assist us with the commercialization\nof our PARA OPSTM product line up to January 2022; the engagement of AMW Public Relations in November 2021\nto lead our United States public relations, brand strategy and media communications initiatives; and the engagement\nof Orchid Advisors to assist us with ATF compliance for our PARA OPSTM product line. The increase in S&M\nincludes $0.2 million of additional share-based compensation in lieu of cash consideration to certain strategic\nadvisors.\n• R&D increased by 30% or $0.3 million primarily due to an increase in headcount to accelerate product development.\nThe increase in personnel costs included $0.4 million of additional share-based compensation.\nNet Finance Costs\nTotal finance costs for Q2 Fiscal 2022 and YTD Fiscal 2022 were $72,479 and $120,121 respectively, a 379% and 263%\nincrease over the comparable prior periods primarily due to the accretion and interest costs relating to the Unsecured Loans\n(see Business Overview section of this MD&A), and the accretion of the discounted royalties payable to DEFSEC Corporation\nfor the acquisition of the technology known at the time as the Low Energy Cartridge system, now branded as PARA OPSTM.\n10 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2022\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\nThe following tables summarize selected results for the eight most recent completed quarters to March 31, 2022 (unaudited).\nJune 2021 September 2021 December 2021 March 2022\n($ in thousands, except per share) (Q3 FY21) (Q4 FY21) (Q1 FY22) (Q2 FY22)\nRevenue $ 522 $ 160 $ 17 $ 166\nCost of sales $ 315 $ 80 $ 25 $ 142\nGross profit $ 207 $ 80 $ (8) $ 24\nGross margin % 39.6% 49.7% -45.9% 14.6%\nOperating expenses $ 2,798 $ 2,925 $ 3,196 $ 2,231\nOperating loss $ (2,591) $ (2,845) $ (3,204) $ (2,207)\nOther income (expenses) $ (37) $ (38) $ (39) $ (83)\nNet loss $ 2,628 $ 2,883 $ 3,243 $ 2,290\nNet finance costs $ 28 $ 19 $ 48 $ 72\nDepreciation and amortization $ 13 $ 53 $ 72 $ 73\nEBITDA loss $ 2,587 $ 2,811 $ 3,123 $ 2,145\nAdjusted EBITDA loss $ 2,017 $ 1,831 $ 2,204 $ 1,712\nLoss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.06) $ (0.06) $ (0.07) $ (0.05)\nWeighted average common shares - basic 46,016,645 47,745,525 49,022,129 49,868,065\nJune 2020 September 2020 December 2020 March 2021\n($ in thousands, except per share) (Q3 FY20) (Q4 FY20) (Q1 FY21) (Q2 FY21)\nRevenue $ 600 $ 213 $ 146 $ 448\nCost of sales $ 144 $ 95 $ 72 $ 332\nGross profit $ 456 $ 118 $ 74 $ 116\nGross margin % 76.1% 55.1% 55.1% 26.0%\nOperating expenses $ 1,048 $ 2,392 $ 1,580 $ 2,376\nOperating loss $ (626) $ (2,274) $ (1,506) $ (2,260)\nOther income (expenses) $ (186) $ 248 $ (21) $ (17)\nNet loss $ 812 $ 2,026 $ 1,527 $ 2,277\nNet finance costs $ 91 $ (45) $ 18 $ 15\nDepreciation and amortization $ 69 $ 15 $ 39 $ 35\nEBITDA loss $ 652 $ 2,056 $ 1,470 $ 2,227\nAdjusted EBITDA loss $ 392 $ 573 $ 1,193 $ 1,627\nLoss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.03) $ (0.07) $ (0.04) $ (0.05)\nWeighted average common shares - basic 30,393,359 33,024,736 41,392,149 42,141,523\nNote: due to preparing the table in thousands, there may be rounding differences.\nQuarterly Results Trend Analysis\nThere is no material change to our quarterly results trend from our disclosure in our annual MD&A dated November 23,\n2021, except that we expect further volatility with our quarterly revenue during Fiscal 2022 due to the Police Ordnance\nAcquisition, pending commercial launch of PARA OPSTM products, and anticipated new military contracts. Additionally, we\nhave significantly reduced OPEX in the current quarter compared to prior quarters mainly due to reduction in share-based\ncompensation expense and promotional spend; however, we expect the promotional spend will increase in future quarters\nwith the commercial launch of PARA OPSTM in the United States.\n11 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2022\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table summarizes our financial position:\nMarch 31, September 30,\n(Unaudited) 2022 2021\nAssets\nCurrent $ 2,497,103 $ 4,055,697\nNon-current 5,155,557 4,662,149\nTotal assets $ 7,652,660 $ 8,717,846\nLiabilities\nCurrent $ 1,589,525 $ 1,159,490\nNon-current 3,002,363 1,434,628\nTotal liabilities 4,591,888 2,594,118\nNet assets $ 3,060,772 $ 6,123,728\nWorking capital (1) $ 907,578 $ 2,896,207\n(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.\nOur working capital was $0.9 million at March 31, 2022, a decrease of $2.0 million from September 30, 2021. This decrease\nwas mainly driven by our net operating loss for YTD Fiscal 2022, which was partially offset by the net proceeds from the\nUnsecured Loans and net assets assumed from the Police Ordnance Acquisition.\nTotal assets decreased by $1.1 million from September 30, 2021, mainly due to $1.6 million decrease in currents assets driven\nby the $2.9 million net use of cash to fund our operating activities, partially offset by the net current assets assumed in the\nPolice Ordnance Acquisition. Additionally, the total decrease was partially offset by an increase of $0.5 million in non-current\nassets, largely due to the increase in intangible assets from capitalized development costs for our PhantomTM and PARA\nOPSTM systems and acquired intangible assets from Police Ordnance.\nTotal liabilities increased by $2.0 million from September 30, 2021, mainly due to the Unsecured Loans financing in March\n2022 (see below).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary sources of capital to date have been from security offerings, exercise of stock options and warrants, and, to a\nlesser extent, pre-commercial revenue. At March 31, 2022, our cash position was $1.5 million, a decrease of $1.2 million\nsince September 30, 2021 primarily due to incurring a net operating loss for YTD Fiscal 2022, offset primarily by an increase\nin cash from the net proceeds of the Unsecured Loans financing in March 2022.\nWhile we are confident we will be awarded additional customer contracts in Fiscal 2022, we expect additional capital will be\nrequired to initially fund these potential contracts, our commercialization efforts in the United States for the launch of the\nPARA OPSTM system, R&D activities and our working capital requirements over the next twelve months. Potential sources\nof capital may include additional equity and/or debt financings, Canadian ITCs for SR&ED activities, and other government\nfunding such as Innovation Solutions Canada. Based on management’s current projection, the minimum additional funding\nrequired to remain in business for at least the next 12 months is approximately $6.5 million, excluding any potential new\n12 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2022\ncustomer contracts. While we are currently in active discussions with current and prospective investors, there can be no\nassurance that we will be able to obtain the capital sufficient to meet any or all of our needs. In our view, the availability of\ncapital will be affected by, among other things, capital market conditions, the success of our PARA OPSTM system\ncommercialization efforts, timing for winning new customer contracts, potential acquisitions, and other relevant\nconsiderations. In the event we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our existing shareholders will likely\nexperience dilution, and any additional incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and\ncould require us to agree to operational and financial covenants that could further restrict our operations. Any failure to raise\nadditional funds on terms favorable to us or at all may require us to significantly change or curtail our current or planned\noperations in order to conserve cash until such time, if ever, that sufficient proceeds from operations are generated, and could\nresult in us not being in a position to advance our commercialization strategy or take advantage of business opportunities.\nCash Flows\nOur approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we always have sufficient liquidity to meet our\nliabilities as they come due. We regularly perform cash flow forecasts to ensure that we have sufficient cash to meet our\noperational needs while maintaining sufficient liquidity. At this time, we do not use any derivative financial instruments to\nhedge our currency risk.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the respective periods:\nSix months ended March 31,\n(Unaudited) 2022 2021\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ ( 2,880,326) $ ( 3,093,889)\nInvesting activities (332,997) (61,250)\nFinancing acitivities 2 ,042,380 829,147\nNet cash outflows $ ( 1,170,943) $ (2,325,992)\nCash, beginning of period 2,688,105 3,073,760\nCash, end of period $ 1 ,517,162 $ 747,768\nCash used by operating activities\nAs previously noted, we have funded our operating activities primarily from additional equity and debt financing for both\nperiods in Fiscal 2022 and 2021. For the six months ended March 31, 2022, total cash flow used in operating activities\ndecreased by 7% compared to the same period in Fiscal 2021; however, we expect this to reverse for the next couple quarters\nas we increase our investment for the launch of PARA OPSTM in the United States and build inventories across all three\nbusiness lines.\nCash used by investing activities\nCash flow used in investing activities increased in YTD Fiscal 2022 compared to YTD Fiscal 2021 mainly due to $0.4 million\nin capitalized development costs and $0.1 million in additions to capital assets, net by $0.2 million net cash acquired from\nthe Police Ordnance Acquisition.\nCash provided by financing activities\nThe $1.2 million increase in cash provided by financing activities in YTD Fiscal 2022 over YTD Fiscal 2021 was primarily\ndriven by the closing of Unsecured Loans in Q2 Fiscal 2022, net of debt offering costs. The net increase was also partially\noffset by the lower aggregate proceeds from exercise of stock options and warrants in the current period.\n13 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2022\nCapital Management\nOur objective in managing our capital is to safeguard KWESST’s ability to continue as a going concern and to sustain future\ndevelopment of the business.

This MD&A has been prepared\nwith an effective date of August 11, 2022.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the\nthree and nine months ended June 30, 2022 (“Q3 Fiscal 2022 FS”) and the annual audited consolidated financial statements\nand related notes for the year ended September 30, 2021 (“Fiscal 2021 FS”). The financial information presented in this\nMD&A is derived from these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\nThis MD&A contains forward-looking statements involves risk, uncertainties and assumptions, including statements\nregarding anticipated developments in future financial periods and our future plans and objectives. There can be no assurance\nthat such information will prove to be accurate, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking\nstatements. See “Forward-Looking Statements”.\nAll references to $ or dollar amounts in this MD&A are to Canadian currency unless otherwise indicated.\nAdditional information, including press releases, relating to KWESST is available for view on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nIn this MD&A, we have presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA\nthat has been adjusted for the removal of stock-based compensation, foreign exchange loss (gain) and any one-time, irregular\nand nonrecurring items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to provide readers with a supplemental measure of our operating performance\nand thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial\nmeasures. Management also uses non-IFRS measures, in addition to IFRS financial measures, to understand and compare\noperating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting\npurposes, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that these non-IFRS financial measures enable us to identify\nunderlying trends in our business that could otherwise be hidden by the effect of certain expenses that we exclude in the\ncalculations of the non-IFRS financial measures.\nAccordingly, we believe that these non-IFRS financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for\nmeaningful comparisons and analysis in the business and provides useful information to investors and securities analysts, and\nother interested parties in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing their overall understanding of our\npast performance and future prospects.\nWe caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures do not replace the presentation of our IFRS financial results and\nshould only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. There\nare limitations in the use of non-IFRS measures because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under\nIFRS as well as they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-IFRS financial\nmeasure. Furthermore, other peers may use other non-IFRS measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-\nIFRS measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as tools for\ncomparison.\nGOING CONCERN\nAs an early-stage company, we have incurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have\nprimarily been funded from financing activities. KWESST’s Q3 Fiscal 2022 FS have been prepared on the “going concern”\nbasis which presumes that KWESST will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of\nbusiness for the foreseeable future.

This document and other information about KWESST\nare available on SEDAR under the Company’s profile at www.sedar.com.\nMajor Highlights\nThe following is a summary of the major highlights that occurred during the nine months ended June 30, 2022 (“YTD\nFiscal 2022”).\n• On October 13, 2021, we announced that we are accelerating the readiness of deployable and man-wearable\nBattlefield Laser Detection System (“BLDS”) for first deliveries available by end of Q1 Fiscal 2022, following\nmilitary interest from a number of NATO land and Special Operation Forces at the signature European defense\nshow, DESI, which took place in London, UK, on September 13 to 18, 2021. While no deliveries took place to date,\nwe continue to be actively engaged with an overseas NATO country for the potential purchase of four vehicle-\nmounted versions of the BLDS for Special Forces light patrol vehicles during Q4 Fiscal 2022 for delivery in Q1\nFiscal 2023.\n• On November 12, 2021, we announced that General Dynamics Land Systems (“GDLS”) has selected KWESST’s\nPhantom electronic battlefield decoy as part of its ongoing efforts to develop a next generation multi-million domain\nmobile capability at the tactical level. If GLDS wins the contract with their United States military customer, we\nhave estimated the potential value for this contract to KWESST could be more than USD $40 million, depending\non the number of Phantom units per military vehicle and final pricing based on volume. The United States military\ncustomer is expected to announce the winner of the tender for 400-500 next generation military vehicles in calendar\n2023. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will be awarded this contract or if we are, what the value of such\ncontract will be to KWESST.\n• On November 15, 2021, we conducted live fire demonstrations of our initial non-lethal cartridge-based single shot\ndevice for investors near Toronto, Ontario, including an opportunity for these investors to use the devices. Further,\non January 14, 2022, we announced the unveiling of our non-lethal cartridge-based products under the brand PARA\nOPS at the 2022 SHOT Show® in Las Vegas held on January 18 to 21, 2022.\n5 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022\n• On November 23, 2021, in connection with an updated capital markets strategy, we submitted our initial application\nto list on The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”). We believe that, if successful, a Nasdaq listing can broaden investor\nawareness for KWESST’s common shares, with a view to supporting shareholder value.\n• On December 2, 2021, we announced that we have engaged the New York-based public relations firm AMW Public\nRelations to lead our public relations, brand strategy, and media communication initiatives.\n• On December 8, 2021, our United States military customer accepted the delivery of the final milestone of the US\n$0.8 million relating to the integration of our TASCS IFM with the 81 mortar system. Final payment was received\nin January 2022. While we expect follow-on customer orders for this solution during Fiscal 2023, there is no\nassurance we will receive such orders.\n• On December 14 and 16, 2021, we announced that we signed a Master Services Agreement with General Dynamics\nMission Systems – Canada (“GDMS”) to support the development of digitization solutions for future Canadian land\nC4ISR programs. At the time of entering this agreement, we estimated the contract’s value to KWESST to be up to\n$1.0 million over 12 months. We delivered on the first Statement of Work (“SOW”) during Q3 Fiscal 2022 and\nexpect to sign a follow-on SOW during Q4 Fiscal 2022 and another SOW in Q2 Fiscal 2023. We now estimate the\ntotal contract value to KWESST to be approximately $0.7 million.\n• On December 15, 2021, we completed the non-cash acquisition of Police Ordnance Company Inc. – see below\n“Acquisition” for further details. On January 10, 2022, we announced that Police Ordnance Company Inc. received\norders from law enforcement agencies for approximately $0.4 million in ARWEN products, all have since been\ndelivered as of the date of this MD&A. However, as most of the shipments related to open customer orders at the\nacquisition date, these were not recorded as revenue during the quarter but rather as a reduction of intangible assets\nin accordance with IFRS.\n• At the 2022 SHOT Show held in Las Vegas from January 18th to 21st 2022, we showcased our initial PARA OPS\nsingle shot device. Since this event, we have continued to make further improvements to this device based on\npositive feedback from the SHOT Show. As of the date of this MD&A, we have finalized the design of the single\nshot device and are in the process of producing small quantities for market testing prior to commercial launch by\nend of Fiscal 2022. We are also in the process of optimizing the design of our multi-shot device for market testing\nin September 2022 and commercial launch soon after. Our initial sales focus will be law enforcements (see below\nGovernment Regulations Update).\n• On February 11, 2022, we filed U.S. patent application No. 17/669,420 claiming priority to a provisional patent\nserial 63/148,163 by the USPO for our PARA OPS system.\n• On March 11, 2022, we closed a non-secured and non-convertible loan financing with a syndicate of lenders in an\naggregate amount of $1.8 million and an additional $0.2 million on March 15, 2022, for a total of $2.0 million (the\n“Unsecured Loans”). Our directors and officers participated in the amount of $74,000. See Liquidity and Capital\nResources section of this MD&A for further information.\n• On March 29, 2022, KWESST’s common stock commenced trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the\nsymbol “62U”. We believe this listing will provide us with the opportunity to further increase our investor base\nglobally, improve our stock liquidity, and promote KWESST to the European financial markets.\n• On April 22, 2022, we issued 61,264 common shares to the selling shareholders of Police Ordnance as a result of\nachieving the performance milestone as defined in the share purchase agreement.\n6 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022\n• On April 25, 2022, we announced that we engaged RedChip Companies (“RedChip”) to lead our investor relations\nefforts in the United States in advance of our pending Nasdaq listing. Headquartered in Orlando, Florida, RedChip\nprovides investor relations, financial media, and research for microcap and small-cap stocks.\nThe following is a summary of the major highlights that occurred since Q3 Fiscal 2022:\n• On July 6, 2022, we entered into a three-year contract with Counter-Crisis Technology Inc. (“CC-T”) to design,\ndevelop, and implement a significant component of a national Ground Search and Rescue Incident Command\nSystem for Public Safety Canada, with the Ontario Provincial Police (“OPP”) as technical advisory stakeholder for\nthis project. The total contract value is approximately $0.7 million, net of in-kind contributions of $76,000, over\nthree years of services commencing in late July 2022.\n• On July 14, 2022, we closed a non-brokered private placement, resulting in the issuance of 1,600,000 units of\nKWESST, at a price of $0.215 per July 2022 Unit, for aggregate gross proceeds of $0.34 million. Certain of our\ndirectors and officers participated in the amount of $87,500. See Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this\nMD&A for further information.\nGovernment Regulations Update\nNon-lethal\nUnited States\nIn February 2022, we retained the services of Orchid Advisors to assist us with the classification and ATF compliance for\nour PARA OPS devices. Orchid Advisors is a Federal Firearms License (“FFL”) compliance solutions firm headquartered in\nHartford, Connecticut.\nBased on Orchid Advisor’s interpretation of the ATF rules and regulations, we have self-classified the .67 caliber version of\nthe PARA OPS devices as a “destructive device,” providing us with the ability to go to market much sooner than waiting for\nATF classification ruling. Under the ATF rules, a manufacturer must determine whether the device is a firearm and therefore\nbe subject to ATF regulation, and if it is a firearm whether it is subject to National Firearms Act of 1934 (“NFA”) regulations.\nTo be considered a regulated firearm in the United States, the device must be: (i) a weapon that (ii) will or is designed to\nexpel a projectile (iii) by the action of an explosive. Although primers in ammunition cartridges are exempt from control\nunder the explosives regulations as administered by ATF, they are still considered an “explosive” for the purposes of the\nfirearm definition. Because we use primers in the ammunition cartridges for our PARA OPS devices, we have decided to\nself-classify our PARA OPS devices as a form of firearm in the United States pending any different eventual classification\nby the ATF.\nAs the PARA OPS product line is identified as a firearm in the United States, it must be determined whether an additional\nlevel of control is imposed by the NFA. Under NFA regulations, there are only two possible types of NFA firearm that PARA\nOPS could be defined as: (1) a “any other weapon” (“AOW”) or (2) a “destructive device”. Sale of either of these to consumers\nis permissible but requires a lengthy approval process conducted by the ATF (the background check process on the consumer);\nwhereas sale to law enforcement agencies, military bodies, or government agencies is a more expedient approval process\n(usually less than 7 days). Further, the AOW classification requires only a $5 transfer tax to consumers whereas a destructive\ndevice classification results in a $200 transfer tax to consumers (such tax being borne by the consumer). While our PARA\nOPS is non-lethal (the velocity of our projectile is well below lethal threshold), we have determined that the current version\nof our PARA OPS devices are “destructive devices” because the measurement of the bore of our device is currently in excess\nof the one-half inch in diameter, the maximum size for AOW.\nAs a result, initial sales of our PARA OPS devices in the United States are expected to come primarily from law enforcement\nagencies until we reduce the bore of our device to less than one-half inch in diameter for the consumer market. We expect to\npartner with a FFL manufacturer for the production of our PARA OPS products in the United States during Q4 Fiscal 2022.\nWe are currently developing a new version of PARA OPS device to meet the AOW firearm classification in order to reduce\n7 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022\nthe tax burden on a consumer purchasing the PARA OPS devices. We expect to commercially launch this AOW version\nbefore the end of calendar 2022. The distribution of our PARA OPS in the United States will be done directly with FFL\ndistributors/firearm dealers for civilian sales. Today, all 50 states of the United States allow civilians to own a firearm subject\nto the firearm laws of the state (which vary by state). We expect the sales of our PARA OPS devices will position us well for\nsignificant recurring revenues through the sale of subsequent ammunition over the next 12 months.\nFor the non-lethal ARWEN products, in Canada we maintain a Firearm Business License issued by the Chief Firearms Office\nof the Ontario Ministry of the Solicitor General and a Factory License and Manufacturing – Certificate issued by the Natural\nReserves Canada (renewed on July 29, 2022). Further, we are also registered under the Controlled Goods Program in Canada.\nIn the United States, we maintain a Federal Explosives License/Permit for the manufacturing of explosives and a Federal\nFirearms License for manufacturer and sale of destructive devices, both issued by the ATF in the United States. All sales of\nour ARWEN launchers are made directly to law enforcement agencies.\nRest of the World\nAs our current focus is commercializing PARA OPS in the United States, we have not begun analyzing the related government\nregulations for the rest of the world.\nCOVID-19 Update\nWhile COVID-19 has not had a material impact to our business to date, the following is a summary of what we believe may\nimpact our future business given the persistence of COVID-19: disruptions to business operations resulting from quarantine\nof employees, customers, manufacturers and other third-party service providers in areas affected by the outbreak; disruptions\nto business operations resulting from travel restrictions, including travel to industry tradeshows; and uncertainty around the\nduration of the virus' impact.\nDespite the global vaccination efforts underway, the extent to which COVID-19 could impact our operations, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and cash flows is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Negative financial results,\nuncertainties in the market, and a tightening of credit markets, caused by COVID-19, or a recession, could have a material\nadverse effect on our liquidity and ability to obtain financing in the future.\nACQUISITION\nTo accelerate our growth plans and respond to market opportunities, we made the following acquisition during Fiscal 2022.\nPolice Ordnance\nOn December 15, 2021, we acquired 2720178 Ontario Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation, which owns all of the issued\nand outstanding shares of Police Ordnance Company Inc., an Ontario (Canada) corporation (together, “Police Ordnance”),\nherein referred as the “Police Ordnance Acquisition”. Located in Bowmanville, Ontario, with ancillary operations in Florida,\nPolice Ordnance owns all intellectual properties to the ARWEN product line of launchers, and a proprietary line of 37 mm\ncartridges designed for riot control and tactical teams. Police Ordnance has law enforcement customers across Canada, the\nUnited States, and abroad. The Police Ordnance Acquisition provides us with a strategic opportunity to leverage its law\nenforcement customer base to accelerate growth within our non-lethal public safety business.\nThe fair value of the purchase consideration was $592,822, which comprised of: (i) 277,576 Common Shares, (ii) 200,000\nCommon Share purchase warrants exercisable at a price of $1.72 per share and expiring on December 15, 2024; and (ii)\n61,264 Common Shares contingent on fulfilment of a financial milestone which was achieved in April 2022. At this time the\npurchase price allocation remains preliminary as certain inventory and intangible asset valuation assessments are ongoing.\nWe expect to finalize the allocation in Q4 2022 (refer to Note 4 of the Q3 Fiscal 2022 FS for further financial information).\nWhile this acquisition is expected to be accretive annually based on historical results, we do not expect it will have a material\nimpact to our overall consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows over the next twelve months.\n8 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following selected financial data has been extracted from Q3 Fiscal 2022 FS.\nThree months ended June 30, Change Nine months ended June 30, Change\n(Unaudited) 2022 2021(1) % 2022 2021(1) %\nRevenue $ 282,432 $ 5 21,724 -46% $ 466,148 $ 1,115,757 -58%\nCost of sales (238,350) (315,273) -24% (405,841) (718,309) -44%\nGross profit 44,082 206,451 -79% 60,307 397,448 -85%\nGross margin % 15.6% 39.6% 12.9% 35.6%\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and administrative 1,322,730 1,236,988 7% 3,410,887 2,909,349 17%\nSelling and marketing 851,705 882,261 -3% 2,931,460 2,195,647 34%\nR&D 350,689 678,622 -48% 1,610,445 1,648,711 -2%\nTotal operating expenses 2,525,124 2,797,871 -10% 7,952,792 6,753,707 18%\nOperating loss (2,481,042) (2,591,420) -4% (7,892,485) (6,356,259) 24%\nOther expenses\nGain on acquisition 41,869 - N/A 41,869 - N/A\nNet finance costs (184,177) (27,780) 563% (304,298) (60,857) 400%\nForeign exchange gain (loss) 22,901 (9,025) -354% 22,602 (14,189) -259%\nLoss on disposals - - N/A (1,165) - N/A\nNet loss $ (2,600,449) $ (2,628,225) -1% $ (8,133,477) $ (6,431,305) 26%\nEBITDA loss $ (2,336,150) $ (2,587,006) -10% $ (7,603,871) $ (6,281,964) 21%\nAdjusted EBITDA loss(2) $ ( 1,532,263) $ ( 2,057,558) -26% $ (5,291,673) $ (4,868,894) 9%\nLoss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.05) $ (0.06) -12% $ (0.16) $ (0.15) 8%\nWeighted average common shares - basic 51,988,774 46,016,645 13% 50,288,043 43,126,552 17%\n(1) See Note 2(f) of the Q3 Fiscal 2022 FS.\n(2) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measures.

While the results Q3\nFiscal 2022 remained relatively consistent with the comparable prior period, the YTD Fiscal 2022 net loss increased by $1.7\nmillion over the comparable prior period, primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses driven by higher\nheadcount and related share-based awards, and increased sales and marketing efforts. Additionally, we incurred higher\nprofessional fees relating to our Nasdaq listing application and the prospectus and related Registration Statement with respect\nto an initial public offering, coupled with financing efforts in the United States (see below).\nMost of the adjustments to EBITDA relate to non-cash share-based compensation and professional fees incurred in an effort\nto raise at least US$7.0 million of capital via a brokered private placement in the United States, which we did not close due\nto very challenging global equity market conditions where the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq index declined by approximately\n20.6% and 29.5%, respectively from January 1, 2022, to June 30, 2022. To preserve our remaining liquidity for near-term\nworking capital, certain professional firms involved in this financing have agreed to defer the timing of payment until we\ncomplete an initial public offering on Nasdaq, which remains subject to SEC’s acceptance of our Form F-1 Registration\nStatement and Nasdaq’s approval of our listing on its exchange. The increase in share-based compensation in Q3 Fiscal 2022\ncompared to the same comparable prior period was primarily driven by 678,204 RSUs and 1,200,000 PSUs granted to officers\nand consultants near and at the end of Q2 Fiscal 2022, net of 400,000 PSUs forfeited during the current quarter due to not\nachieving one of the performance milestones as established by the independent directors of our Board. This also contributed\nto the increase in the YTD Fiscal 2022 share-based compensation compared to the same period in Fiscal 2021, coupled with\nan increase in expense for the stock units issued to key business consultants in Q4 Fiscal 2021 and Q1 Fiscal 2022 earned\nover 12 months.\nRevenue and Gross Profit\nThree months ended June 30, Change Nine months ended June 30, Change\n(Unaudited) 2022 2021 % 2022 2021 %\nDigitization $ 157,900 $ 497,792 -68% $ 314,515 $ 1,080,933 -71%\nARWENTM 100,684 - N/A 111,176 - N/A\nTraining and services 23,495 - N/A 39,169 - N/A\nOther 353 23,932 -99% 1,288 34,824 -96%\nTotal revenue $ 282,432 $ 521,724 -46% $ 466,148 $ 1,115,757 -58%\nGross profit $ 44,082 $ 206,451 $ 60,307 $ 397,448\nGross margin 15.6% 39.6% 12.9% 35.6%\nTotal revenue declined by 46% and 58% during Q3 Fiscal 2022 and YTD Fiscal 2022, respectively, compared to same periods\nin Fiscal 2021. Revenue for Digitization product line declined by 68% and 71% for Q3 Fiscal 2022 and YTD Fiscal 2022,\nrespectively, primarily due to the timing of expected contracts and a smaller contract awarded by General Dynamic Mission\nSystems Canada in Q1 Fiscal 2022, compared to the US$0.8 million contract awarded by a US military customer in the same\nquarter in Fiscal 2021 delivered throughout Fiscal 2021. The new ARWEN product line is as a result of the Police Ordnance\nAcquisition made in late Q1 Fiscal 2022. The Q3 Fiscal 2022 and YTD Fiscal 2022 ARWEN revenue excludes $0.2 million\nand $0.3 million, respectively for deliveries of ARWEN products for open customer orders at the closing of the Police\nOrdnance Acquisition which were recognized as a reduction of intangible assets.\nWe expect revenue to ramp up over the next few quarters with new anticipated military contracts, coupled with the pending\ncommercial launch of our PARA OPS, with low-rate initial production (“LRIP”) shipments of the PARA OPS products\nexpected to commence in September 2022. We anticipate transitioning from LRIP to full production with strategic U.S.\nmanufacturing and distribution partners in Q1 Fiscal 2023.\n10 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022\nGross margin was lower for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same prior periods, primarily\ndue to negative gross margin earned on training and services on TASCS IFM and on ARWEN products provided to military\nand law enforcement agencies during Q3 Fiscal 2022 to drive business development for future sales opportunities, which\nresulted in additional ARWEN orders during the quarter for shipment in Q4 Fiscal 2022. Excluding the impact of this negative\nmargin on training and services, our gross margin would have been 33.53% and 26.99% for Q2 Fiscal 2022 and YTD Fiscal\n2022, respectively. Our gross profit will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter with the anticipated new product mix\nand sales volume.\nOperating Expenses (OPEX)\nThree months ended June 30, Change Nine months ended June 30, Change\n(Unaudited) 2022 2021(1) % 2022 2021(1) %\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") $ 1,322,730 $ 1,236,988 7% $ 3,410,887 $ 2,909,349 17%\nSelling and marketing (\"S&M\") 851,705 882,261 -3% 2,931,460 2,195,647 34%\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") 350,689 678,622 -48% 1,610,445 1,648,711 -2%\nTotal operating expenses $ 2,525,124 $ 2,797,871 -10% $ 7,952,792 $ 6,753,707 18%\n(1) See Note 2(f) of the Q3 Fiscal 2022 FS.\nTotal OPEX decreased by 10% or $0.3 million for the current quarter over the comparable prior period driven by a 48%\nreduction in R&D spend due to allocating some of our engineers to revenue-related activities and other projects in which we\ncapitalized development costs (included in intangible assets). This was partially offset by a 7% increase in G&A driven\nprimarily by higher professional fees relating to our US financing effort during Q3 Fiscal 2022 (see above Adjusted EBITDA).\nThis was partially offset by no licensing expense incurred in the current quarter, compared to $0.3 million in Q3 Fiscal 2021\nin connection with our amended licensing agreement with AerialX.\nTotal OPEX increased by 18% or $1.2 million for YTD Fiscal 2022 over the comparable prior period, including $0.5 million\nof additional share-based compensation or 7.1 percentage points of the total increase. Excluding share-based compensation\n(non-cash item), total OPEX was $6.1 million for YTD Fiscal 2022 compared to $5.4 million for YTD Fiscal 2021. The\nincrease was driven by the following factors:\n• G&A increased by 17% or $0.5 million, primarily due augmenting the senior management team with two full-time\nexecutives and recruiting independent directors and other staff, which led to an increase in total personnel costs\nincluding $0.1 million of additional share-based compensation over YTD Fiscal 2021. Additionally, as noted above\nfor the Q3 Fiscal 2022 increase in G&A, we incurred higher professional fees which was partially offset by no\nlicensing expense with AerialX in the current quarter compared to Q3 Fiscal 2021.\n• S&M increased by 34% or $0.7 million; however, excluding share-based compensation S&M increased by $0.4\nmillion. This increase was primarily due to attending various investor conferences in the United States and engaging\nstrategic advisors during Fiscal 2022. This included The Officer Tatum LLC who joined us in July 2021 as our\nstrategic advisor and advocate for our PARA OPS product line for law enforcement and personal defense in the\nUnited States; the engagement of STRYK Group in September 2021 to assist us with the commercialization of our\nPARA OPS product line up to January 2022; the engagement of AMW Public Relations in November 2021 to lead\nour United States public relations, brand strategy and media communications initiatives; and the engagement of\nOrchid Advisors to assist us with ATF compliance for our PARA OPS product line. Additionally, our S&M\npersonnel costs increased as result of the Police Ordinance Acquisition. Partially offsetting this increase in S&M,\nwe reduced our spend in external investor relations and social media promotions.\n11 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022\nNet Finance Costs\nTotal finance costs for Q3 Fiscal 2022 and YTD Fiscal 2022 were $0.2 million and $0.3 million respectively, a 563% and\n400% increase over the comparable prior periods primarily due to the accretion and interest costs relating to the Unsecured\nLoans (see Business Overview section of this MD&A) and the accretion cost of the discounted royalties payable to DEFSEC\nCorporation for the PARA OPS technology acquisition.\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\nThe following tables summarize selected results for the eight most recent completed quarters to June 30, 2022 (unaudited).\nSeptember 2021 December 2021 March 2022 June 2022\n($ in thousands, except per share) (Q4 FY21) (Q1 FY22) (Q2 FY22) (Q3 FY22)\nRevenue $ 160 $ 17 $ 166 $ 282\nCost of sales $ 80 $ 25 $ 142 $ 238\nGross profit $ 80 $ (8) $ 24 $ 44\nGross margin % 50.0% -45.9% 14.6% 15.6%\nOperating expenses $ 2,925 $ 3,196 $ 2,231 $ 2,525\nOperating loss $ (2,845) $ (3,204) $ (2,207) $ (2,481)\nOther income (expenses) $ (38) $ (39) $ (83) $ (119)\nNet loss $ 2,883 $ 3,243 $ 2,290 $ 2,600\nNet finance costs $ 19 $ 48 $ 72 $ 184\nDepreciation and amortization $ 53 $ 72 $ 73 $ 81\nEBITDA loss $ 2,811 $ 3,123 $ 2,145 $ 2,336\nOther adjustments:\nStock-based compensation $ 998 $ 928 $ 423 $ 525\nProfessional fees relating to U.S. financing $ - $ 112 $ 44 $ 344\nGain on acquisition $ - $ - $ - $ (42)\nForeign exchange loss (gain) $ (19) $ (9) $ 9 $ (24)\nLoss on disposal $ 1 $ - $ 1 $ -\nAdjusted EBITDA loss $ 1,831 $ 2,092 $ 1,668 $ 1,532\nLoss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.06) $ (0.07) $ (0.05) $ (0.05)\nWeighted average common shares - basic 47,745,525 49,022,129 49,868,065 51,988,774\n12 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022\nSeptember 2020 December 2020 March 2021 June 2021\n($ in thousands, except per share) (Q4 FY20) (Q1 FY21) (Q2 FY21) (Q3 FY21)\nRevenue $ 213 $ 146 $ 448 $ 522\nCost of sales $ 95 $ 72 $ 332 $ 315\nGross profit $ 118 $ 74 $ 116 $ 207\nGross margin % 55.1% 55.1% 26.0% 39.6%\nOperating expenses $ 2,392 $ 1,580 $ 2,376 $ 2,798\nOperating loss $ (2,274) $ (1,506) $ (2,260) $ (2,591)\nOther income (expenses) $ 248 $ (21) $ (17) $ (37)\nNet loss $ 2,026 $ 1,527 $ 2,277 $ 2,628\nNet finance costs $ (45) $ 18 $ 15 $ 28\nDepreciation and amortization $ 15 $ 39 $ 35 $ 13\nEBITDA loss $ 2,056 $ 1,470 $ 2,227 $ 2,587\nOther adjustments:\nNon-cash M&A costs $ 1,515 $ - $ - $ -\nStock-based compensation $ 137 $ 274 $ 605 $ 555\nFair value adjustments on derivatives $ (178) $ - $ - $ -\nForeign exchange loss (gain) $ 9 $ 3 $ (5) $ 15\nAdjusted EBITDA loss $ 573 $ 1,193 $ 1,627 $ 2,017\nLoss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.07) $ (0.04) $ (0.05) $ (0.06)\nWeighted average common shares - basic 33,024,736 41,392,149 42,141,523 46,016,645\nNote: due to preparing the table in thousands, there may be rounding differences.\nQuarterly Results Trend Analysis\nThere is no material change to our quarterly results trend from our disclosure in our annual MD&A dated November 23,\n2021, except that we expect further volatility with our quarterly revenue during Fiscal 2022 due to the Police Ordnance\nAcquisition, pending commercial launch of PARA OPS products, and anticipated new military contracts. Additionally,\nexcluding non-cash share-based compensation, we have significantly reduced OPEX in the last two quarters by reducing\ndiscretionary spending to conserve liquidity for activities generating revenue or near commercialization (including PARA\nOPS). Subject to closing on additional capital, we expect this trend to reverse in future quarters with the commercial launch\nof PARA OPS in the United States.\n13 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table summarizes our financial position:\nJune 30, September 30,\n(Unaudited) 2022 2021\nAssets\nCurrent $ 1,139,586 $ 4,055,697\nNon-current 5,382,825 4,662,149\nTotal assets $ 6,522,411 $ 8,717,846\nLiabilities\nCurrent $ 4,234,017 $ 1,159,490\nNon-current 1,297,386 1,434,628\nTotal liabilities 5,531,403 2,594,118\nNet assets $ 991,008 $ 6,123,728\nWorking capital (1) $ (3,094,431) $ 2,896,207\n(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.\nOur working capital was negative $3.1 million at June 30, 2022, a decrease of $6.0 million from September 30, 2021. This\ndecrease was mainly driven by our net operating loss for YTD Fiscal 2022, which was partially offset by the net proceeds\nfrom the Unsecured Loans and net assets assumed from the Police Ordnance Acquisition.\nTotal assets decreased by $2.2 million from September 30, 2021, mainly due to $2.9 million decrease in currents assets driven\nby the $2.5 million net use of cash to fund our operating activities, partially offset by the net current assets assumed in the\nPolice Ordnance Acquisition. Additionally, the total decrease was partially offset by an increase of $0.7 million in non-current\nassets, largely due to the increase in intangible assets from capitalized development costs for our Phantom and PARA OPS\nsystems, coupled with the acquired intangible assets from Police Ordnance.\nTotal liabilities increased by $2.9 million from September 30, 2021, mainly due to the Unsecured Loans financing in March\n2022 (see below) and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to deferred payments with certain vendors\n(mainly professional firms).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary sources of capital to date have been from security offerings, exercise of stock options and warrants, and, to a\nlesser extent, pre-commercial revenue. As at June 30, 2022, our cash position was $0.2 million, a decrease of $2.5 million\nsince September 30, 2021 primarily due to incurring a net operating loss for YTD Fiscal 2022, offset primarily by an increase\nin cash from the net proceeds of the Unsecured Loans financing in March 2022 and exercise of warrants.\nWhile we are confident we will be awarded additional customer contracts in Fiscal 2022, we expect additional capital will be\nrequired to initially fund these potential contracts, our commercialization efforts in the United States for the launch of the\nPARA OPS system, R&D activities and our working capital requirements over the next twelve months. Potential sources of\ncapital may include additional equity and/or debt financings, Canadian ITCs for SR&ED activities, and other government\nfunding such as Innovation Solutions Canada. Based on management’s current estimates, the minimum additional funding\n14 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022\nrequired to fund operations at their current level of business activities, including contractual obligations, for at least the next\n12 months is approximately $10 million, excluding any potential new customer contracts or cost reduction measures which\ncould be implemented. While we continue to be in active discussions with investors, there can be no assurance that we will\nbe able to obtain the capital sufficient to meet any or all of our needs. In our view, the availability of capital will be affected\nby, among other things, capital market conditions, the success of our PARA OPS system commercialization efforts, timing\nfor winning new customer contracts, potential acquisitions, and other relevant considerations. In the event we raise additional\nfunds by issuing equity securities, our existing shareholders will likely experience dilution, and any additional incurrence of\nindebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operational and financial\ncovenants that could further restrict our operations. Any failure to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all\nmay require us to significantly change or curtail our current or planned operations in order to conserve cash until such time,\nif ever, that sufficient proceeds from operations are generated, and could result in us not being in a position to advance our\ncommercialization strategy or take advantage of business opportunities.\nCash Flows\nOur approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we always have sufficient liquidity to meet our\nliabilities as they come due. We regularly perform cash flow forecasts to ensure that we have sufficient cash to meet our\noperational needs while maintaining sufficient liquidity. At this time, we do not use any derivative financial instruments to\nhedge our currency risk.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the respective periods:\nNine months ended June 30,\n(Unaudited) 2022 2021\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ ( 3,947,752) $ ( 4,718,229)\nInvesting activities ( 614,028) (299,909)\nFinancing acitivities 2,063,262 4 ,376,504\nNet cash outflows $ ( 2,498,518) $ ( 641,634)\nCash, beginning of period 2,688,105 3 ,073,760\nCash, end of period $ 189,587 $ 2 ,432,126\nCash used by operating activities\nAs previously noted, we have funded our operating activities primarily from additional equity and debt financing for both\nperiods in Fiscal 2022 and 2021. For the nine months ended June 30, 2022, total cash flow used in operating activities\ndecreased by 16% compared to the same period in Fiscal 2021 primarily due to deferring payments with certain vendors\n(primarily professional firms) to conserve cash for near-term working capital. However, we expect this to reverse for the next\nquarter as we honor our payment commitments with these vendors coupled with an increase in cash outflows for the launch\nof PARA OPS in the United States and additional inventories across all three business lines.\nCash used by investing activities\nCash flow used in investing activities increased in YTD Fiscal 2022 compared to YTD Fiscal 2021 mainly due to $0.8 million\nin capitalized development costs and $0.2 million in additions to capital assets, partially offset by net cash acquired from the\nPolice Ordnance Acquisition.\nCash provided by financing activities\n15 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022\nThe $2.3 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities in YTD Fiscal 2022 over YTD Fiscal 2021 was primarily\ndriven by lower capital raised. In YTD Fiscal 2021, we raised net proceeds of $4.0 million from equity issuance in a brokered\nprivate placement; whereas, for YTD Fiscal 2022 we raised net proceeds of $2.0 million from Unsecured Loans (see below).\nWe also benefited from higher volume of exercised stock options, offset partially by repayment of related party loans, during\nYTD Fiscal 2021.\nCapital Management\nOur objective in managing our capital is to safeguard KWESST’s ability to continue as a going concern and to sustain future\ndevelopment of the business. KWESST senior management is responsible for managing the capital through regular review\nof financial information to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet operating requirements and investments to support\nits growth strategy. The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing this process. From time to time, we could issue new\ncommon shares or debt to maintain or adjust our capital structure. We are not subject to any externally imposed capital\nrequirements or restrictions.\nKWESST’s capital is composed of the following:\nJune 30, September 30,\n(Unaudited) 2022 2021\nDebt:\nLease obligations $ 2 91,860 $ 3 07,909\nBorrowings 1 ,752,865 5 3,251\nEquity:\nShare capital 1 9,165,734 1 7,215,068\nWarrants 1 ,902,055 1 ,848,389\nContributed surplus 3 ,473,768 2 ,458,211\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss ( 28,123) ( 8,991)\nAccumulated deficit ( 23,606,494) ( 15,388,949)\nTotal capital $ 2 ,951,665 $ 6 ,484,888\nAt June 30, 2022, our contractual obligations and commitments were as follows:\nPayment due: Total Within 1 Year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years\nMinimum royalty commitments $ 2,500,000 $ 150,000 $ 350,000 $ 2,000,000\nBorrowings 2,090,000 2,090,000 - -\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 2,263,702 2,263,702 - -\nLease obligations 351,000 93,600 187,200 70,200\nOther commitments 12,886 12,886 - -\nShort-term rental obligations 10,574 10,574 - -\nTotal contractual obligations $ 7,228,162 $ 4,620,762 $ 537,200 $ 2,070,200\nEquity Issuances\nWe issued a total of 3,221,476 common shares during YTD Fiscal 2022 primarily due to 1,330,000 exercise of warrants,\n1,000,000 bonus common shares related to the Unsecured Loans (see below), 542,636 conversion of stock units, and 338,840\ncommon shares for the Police Ordnance Acquisition (see Acquisition section of this MD&A).\n16 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022\nIn July 2022, we closed a non-brokered private placement of $344,000, resulting in the issuance of 1,600,000 units of\nKWESST (“July 2022 Units”), at a price of $0.215 per July 2022 Unit (the “Issue Price”), for aggregate gross proceeds of\n$344,000 (the “July 2022 Offering”). Each July 2022 Unit is comprised of one common share and one-half common share\npurchase warrant (the “Warrants”). Each Warrant entitles its holder to acquire one additional common share of KWESST at\na price of $0.285 for a period of 24 months from the closing date. Accordingly, we issued 800,000 Warrants under the July\n2022 Offering. There was no finder fee paid in this private placement. The proceeds from the July 2022 Offering will be used\nto fund our working capital requirements. All securities issued in connection with the July 2022 Offering are subject to a\nstatutory hold period in Canada expiring four (4) months and one (1) day from the closing of the Offering. We have received\nfinal acceptance by the TSX Venture Exchange.\nIn connection with the July 2022 Offering, certain of our directors and officers (the “Insiders”) purchased 406,975 Units for\na total consideration of $87,500. The issuance of Units to the Insiders constitutes a related party transaction but is exempt\nfrom the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority\nSecurity Holders in Special Transactions (\"MI 61-101”) as KWESST’s securities are not listed on any stock exchange\nidentified in Section 5.5(b) of MI 61-101 and neither the fair market value of the units issued to the Insiders, nor the fair\nmarket value of the entire private placement, exceeds 25% of our market capitalization.\nDebt Offerings\nSince September 30, 2021, we conducted the following debt offering:\nOn March 11, 2022, we closed a non-secured and non-convertible loan financing with various lenders in an aggregate amount\nof $1.8 million, which was upsized to $2.0 million on March 15, 2022. The Unsecured Loans bear interest at a rate of 9.0%\nper annum, compounded monthly and not in advance, and have a maturity of thirteen months, with us having the option to\nrepay the whole or any part of the Unsecured Loans, without penalty or premium, at any time prior to the close of business\non the maturity date. The principal amount is due only at maturity. As part of the terms of the Unsecured Loans, we issued\nan aggregate of 1 million common shares to the lenders as a bonus. These common shares were issued pursuant to prospectus\nexemptions of applicable securities laws and therefore subject to a four-month plus one day trading restriction. The use of\nproceeds was for working capital purposes.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our results\nof operations, financial condition, revenues or expenses, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nRefer to Note 9 of Q3 Fiscal 2022 FS for disclosure about KWESST’s related party transactions conducted in the normal\ncourse of business.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS\nWe recognize financial assets and liabilities when we become party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. On initial\nrecognition, financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the financial\nassets and liabilities, except for financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, whereby the transactions\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nRefer to Note 16 of the Q3 Fiscal 2022 FS for further disclosure on KWESST’s financial instruments.\n17 | Pa ge\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nRefer to Note 2(g) of the Fiscal 2021 audited consolidated financial statements and Note 2(g) of the Q3 Fiscal 2022 FS for a\ndiscussion of the accounting policies and estimates that are critical to the understanding of our business operations and the\nresults of our operations.\nOUTSTANDING SHARE INFORMATION\nAs at June 30, 2022, KWESST’s authorized capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares with no stated par\nvalue. There were 53,787,107 outstanding and issued common shares as at August 11, 2022.\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nDisclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) are intended to provide reasonable assurance that material information is\ngathered and reported to senior management to permit timely decisions regarding public disclosure.

This MD&A has been\nprepared with an effective date of January 27, 2023.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September\n30, 2022 (“Fiscal 2022”). The financial information presented in this MD&A is derived from these consolidated financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International\nAccounting Standards Board (“IASB”). This MD&A contains forward-looking statements and information that involves risk,\nuncertainties and assumptions, including statements regarding anticipated developments in future financial periods and our\nfuture plans and objectives. There can be no assurance that such information will prove to be accurate, and readers are\ncautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements.\nAll references to “$” or “dollar” amounts in this MD&A are to Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated.\nAdditional information, including press releases, relating to KWESST is available for view on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nIn this MD&A, we have presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA\nthat has been adjusted for the removal of one-time, irregular and nonrecurring items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to provide\nreaders with a supplemental measure of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may\nnot otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management also uses non-IFRS measures, in\naddition to IFRS financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and\noperational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe\nthat these non-IFRS financial measures enable us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise by hidden\nby the effect of certain expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-IFRS financial measures.\nAccordingly, we believe that these non-IFRS financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for\nmeaningful comparisons and analysis in the business and provides useful information to investors and securities analysts, and\nother interested parties in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing their overall understanding of our\npast performance and future prospects.\nWe caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures do not replace the presentation of our IFRS financial results and\nshould only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. There\nare limitations in the use of non-IFRS measures because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under\nIFRS as well as they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-IFRS financial\nmeasure. Furthermore, other peers may use other non-IFRS measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-\nIFRS measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as tools for\ncomparison.\nGOING CONCERN\nAs an early-stage company, we have not yet reached commercial production for most of our products and have incurred\nsignificant losses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities.\nOur audited consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2022 have been prepared on the “going concern’’ basis which\npresumes that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business for the\nforeseeable future.

We focus on three niche market\nsegments as follows:\nOur core mission is to protect and save lives.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022 (“Fiscal 2022”) we have made significant investments to position KWESST for\nfuture success including the following events:\n• We acquired Police Ordnance Company Inc. (“Police Ordnance”), including its ARWEN product line of launchers\nand a proprietary line of 37mm cartridges designed for riot control and tactical teams. This added a complementary\nproduct line to our non-lethal business line.\n• We entered into new strategic partnerships to accelerate our business growth strategies, including:\n General Dynamic Mission Systems – Canada (“GDMS-C”): for future military digitization development;\n Thales Canada Inc. and Modis Canada Inc.: through a co-venture arrangement, we bid on a multi-million\ndollar and multi-year Canadian contract opportunity for specialized software development and integration\nsolutions for the Canadian Army, and we expect the results to be known in Q2 Fiscal 2023;\n General Dynamic Land Systems – Canada (“GDLS-C”): to provide them with our Phantom system as part\na GDLS-C bid for several hundred next-generation vehicles for a prominent United States military\ncustomer. We expect the successful bidder to be announced in calendar 2023;\n Persistent Systems LLC: to team up with our respective products and services to offer integrated solutions\nto various customers to the Canadian Department of National Defence (“DND”);\n Counter Crisis-Technology Inc. (“CC-T”): to partner with them in developing and implementing a national\nGround Search and Rescue Incident Command System (“GSAR ICS”) for Public Safety Canada. This\ninvolves incorporating a Search and Rescue plug-in application the TAK Team Awareness Kit (“TAK”),\nby leveraging our digitization and TAK integration capabilities with military customers.\n5 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nAdditionally, we completed our cross-border listing on the Nasdaq and our common shares began trading on December 7,\n2022, under the stock symbol “KWE” and certain of our outstanding warrants under the symbol “KWESW” on the same day.\nOn December 9, 2022, we closed our U.S. IPO (as defined below) and the Canadian Offering (as defined below) for aggregate\ngross proceeds of USD$14.1 million, before deducting underwriting and offering costs (see Financial Condition, Liquidity\nand Capital Resources section for further details). In advance of the Nasdaq listing, on October 28, 2022, we effected a one\nfor seventy (1-for-70) reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of our common shares (the “Common Shares”) to meet\nNasdaq’s initial listing requirements.

The decline in revenue\nwas driven mainly due to the timing of expected contracts and a smaller contract awarded by GDMS-C and CC-T during the\ncurrent year compared to the US$0.8 million contract awarded by a United States military customer in the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 (“Fiscal 2021”). This was partially offset by $0.3 million from the ARWEN product line as a result of\nthe Police Ordnance acquisition made in late Q1 Fiscal 2022. The ARWEN revenue excludes $0.4 million for deliveries in\nrelation to open customer orders at the closing of the Police Ordnance acquisition which were recognized as a reduction of\nintangible assets.\nWe expect revenue to ramp up during Fiscal 2023 with new anticipated military contracts, coupled with the pending\ncommercial launch of our PARA OPS, scheduled for Q2 Fiscal 2023, and full year revenue results from the ARWEN product\nline.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit was $0.2 million for Fiscal 2022, or gross margin of 25.6%, compared to $0.5 million in Fiscal 2021 with\ngross margin of 37.4%. The fluctuation in gross profit / margin is primarily due to our pre-commercialization phase.\nOperating Expenses (“OPEX”)\nTotal operating expenses were $10.3 million for Fiscal 2022, a 6% increase over the prior year. Excluding share-based\ncompensation (non-cash item), total OPEX was $8.3 million compared to $7.2 million over the prior year. This represents a\n15% increase which was driven mostly by accrued bonuses to our employees and management (none in the prior year) for\ntheir significant contributions in positioning KWESST for future success, coupled with higher professional fees incurred\nrelating to a brokered private placement financing effort during the Spring 2022 that did not close due to very challenging\n7 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nglobal equity market conditions where S&P 500 index and Nasdaq index declined by approximately 20.6% and 29.5%,\nrespectively from January 1, 2022, to June 30, 2022. We subsequently completed a successful cross-border listing on Nasdaq\nwith a U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, which both closed in December 2022. Professional fees relating to this effort were\ncapitalized and reported as deferred share offering costs in our consolidated statements of financial position at September 30,\n2022.\nThe above increase was partially offset by lower spend on advertising and promotion as well as no royalty and license costs\nin the current year compared to the previous year. We expect to incur royalty costs in Fiscal 2023 from expected sales of our\nPARA OPS and Phantom products.\nIn light of the current global inflationary pressure, we expect personnel costs to increase by approximately 10%-15% in Fiscal\n2023, an increase that we plan to pass on to our customers.\nOur R&D expenses during Fiscal 2022 comprised of costs incurred in performing R&D activities, including new product\ndevelopment, continued product enhancement, materials and supplies, salaries and benefits (including share-based\ncompensation), engineering consulting costs, patent procurement costs, and estimated R&D-related facility costs. Where we\nqualify for Canadian investment tax credits for qualified scientific research and experimental development expenditures, we\nrecord this income as a reduction of R&D expenses. Additionally, in accordance with IFRS, we capitalize development costs\nonly if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically or commercially feasible, future\neconomic benefits are probable, and we have the intention and sufficient resources to complete the development and to use\nor sell the asset. Accordingly, we capitalized $1.2 million of development costs during Fiscal 2022 for PARA OPS and\nPhantom, compared to $83 thousand for Phantom during Fiscal 2021. See Note 9 of the Fiscal 2022 FS.\nFinance Costs\nNet finance costs were $0.5 million for Fiscal 2022, a 370% increase over Fiscal 2021 driven mainly by an increase in\nborrowings during Fiscal 2022 and full year accretion cost on the accrued royalties liability relating to the acquisition of the\nPARA OPS system.\nNet Loss and Adjusted EBITDA Loss\nWe incurred a net loss of $10.5 million or $14.41 per basic share for Fiscal 2022, compared to the net loss of $9.3 million or\n$14.72 per basic share for Fiscal 2021. After adjusting for share-based compensation and other items (see table above), our\nAdjusted EBITDA loss was $7.3 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $6.6 million in Fiscal 2021.\nThe increase in net loss and Adjusted EBITDA loss was primarily due to lower revenue and higher OPEX as noted above.\nPrior Year Variance Analysis (2021 vs. 2020)\nRevenue\nWe earned $1.3 million in revenue for Fiscal 2021, compared to $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020\n(“Fiscal 2020”). On an annualized basis, our total revenue increased by 11% over the prior year mainly due to one large\ncontract with a United States military customer relating to our TASCS IFM system. At the end of Fiscal 2021, we estimated\napproximately 98.3% completion on this large contract and have fully delivered the remaining performance obligation since\nSeptember 30, 2021.\nFor both Fiscal 2021 and 2020, our TASCS IFM revenue was concentrated with two United States military customers.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit was $0.5 million for Fiscal 2021, or gross margin of 37%, compared to $0.6 million for Fiscal 2020 with\ngross margin of 71%. The fluctuation in gross profit / margin is due to our pre-commercialization phase. Further, the contract\nthat was awarded to us in Fiscal 2021 was significantly more complex in nature, requiring judgement during the bidding\nprocess in estimating the engineering labor hours to meet the customer requirements. We incurred more engineering labor\n8 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nhours than anticipated, which contributed to the lower gross margin in Fiscal 2021. Costs included enhancements to the\ntechnology for this particular customer.\nOPEX\nTotal operating expenses were $9.7 million for Fiscal 2021, compared to $4.1 million for Fiscal 2020. Excluding M&A costs,\non an annualized basis total operating expenses increased by 185% driven primarily by growth in G&A, S&M and R&D.\n• G&A increased by 12% on an annualized basis; however, excluding the M&A costs, our G&A increased by\n161% primarily due to augmenting the senior management team with two executives and recruiting independent\ndirectors, which led to a significant increase in personnel costs, including share-based compensation. Further,\nas a result of becoming a public company in Canada late in Fiscal 2020, we are now incurring significantly\nmore regulatory costs and director and officer insurance premium costs.\n• S&M increased by 362% on an annualized basis primarily due to making an investment in promoting and\nincreasing awareness about us and our product offerings, including the recruitment of Brandon Tatum, through\nhis private company The Officer Tatum LLC, as our advisor and advocate for our PARA OPS non-lethal system\nfor law enforcement and personal defense in the United States in advance of our commercial launch of the LEC\nSystem anticipated for January 2022. We compensate Officer Tatum primarily in non-cash consideration, RSUs\nand PSUs. Additionally, we made further investments in business development by recruiting consultants in the\nUnited States and in Canada to promote our product offerings.\n• Excluding the investment tax credits (“ITCs”), R&D increased by 88% on an annualized basis primarily due to\nan increase in headcount to accelerate product development to ready products for market. We recognized $0.2\nmillion and $0.1 million of ITCs in Fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, relating to qualified SR&ED projects.\nRecognition takes place only once we have completed our analysis on whether certain R&D projects qualify for\nSR&ED ITCs with the assistance of our external tax professionals. In accordance with IFRS, we capitalized\n$83 thousand of development costs for Phantom during Fiscal 2021, compared to $163 thousand capitalized\ndevelopment costs for our TASCS IFM system during Fiscal 2020, which was subsequently transferred to\ninventory during the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 as a result of winning a follow-on order from the United States\nmilitary customer.\nFinance Costs\nNet finance costs increased marginally in Fiscal 2021 mainly due to the accretion cost on the accrued royalties liability\nrelating to the acquisition of the PARA OPS System.\nNet Loss and Adjusted EBITDA Loss\nWe incurred a net loss of $9.3 million or $14.72 per basic share for Fiscal 2021, compared to the net loss of $3.5 million or\n$8.03 per basic share for Fiscal 2020. After adjusting for share-based compensation, M&A costs, and other items (see table\nabove), our Adjusted EBITDA loss was $6.6 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.6 million in Fiscal 2020.\nThe increase in net loss was primarily due to investments made to drive marketing and promotional activities about us and\nour product offerings, accelerating product development, and recruiting talent to position ourselves for success.\n9 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe following table summarizes our financial position:\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nAssets\nCurrent $ 1,516,393 $ 4,055,697 $ 3,996,514\nNon-current 5,807,070 4,662,149 1,316,263\nTotal assets $ 7,323,463 $ 8,717,846 $ 5,312,777\nLiabilities\nCurrent $ 6,925,880 $ 1,159,490 $ 1,120,004\nNon-current 1,400,474 1,434,628 307,909\nTotal liabilities 8,326,354 2,594,118 1,427,913\nNet assets $ (1,002,891) $ 6,123,728 $ 3,884,864\nWorking capital (1) $ (5,409,487) $ 2,896,207 $ 2,876,510\n(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.\nOur working capital was negative $5.4 million at September 30, 2022, a decrease of $8.3 million partly due to lower equity\nfinancing and higher net loss over the prior year.\nTotal assets decreased by 16% from September 30, 2021, mainly due to $2.5 million decrease in current assets for the same\nreason as noted above for working capital; offset partially by $1.1 million increase in non-current assets driven by capitalized\ndevelopment costs and to a lesser extent new intangible assets from the acquisition of Police Ordnance.\nTotal liabilities increased by $5.8 million from September 30, 2021, mainly driven by additional short-term borrowings and\nan increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to deferred payments with key vendors as well as accrued and\nunpaid wages for certain senior employees who voluntarily deferred their wages until we completed the U.S. IPO and\nCanadian Offering. We also accrued bonuses for staff and management at September 30, 2022 (none in the prior year) – see\nResults of Operations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAvailable Liquidity\nOur approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we always have sufficient liquidity to meet our\nliabilities as they come due. We regularly perform cash flow forecasts to ensure that we have sufficient cash to meet our\noperational needs while maintaining sufficient liquidity. At this time, we do not use any derivative financial instruments to\nhedge our currency risk.\nAt September 30, 2022, our cash position was $0.2 million, a decrease of $2.5 million since September 30, 2021 primarily\ndue to incurring a net operating loss for Fiscal 2022, which was partially offset by additional borrowings and to a lesser extent\nequity financing. Other than a small credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada for a corporate credit card program and foreign\nexchange line of credit, we do not have credit facilities in place.\nOn December 9, 2022, we closed both the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering pursuant to which we received aggregate gross\nproceeds of USD$14.1 million, before underwriting and offering costs (see below, Capital Resources, for further details\n10 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nincluding our expected use of proceeds). With this new capital, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital to timely\nfund our working capital and contractual obligations, including loan repayments, over the next twelve months. However, we\nmay require additional capital in the event we fail to implement our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect\non our financial condition and/or financial performance. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital\nas they are required in the future. Potential sources of capital may include additional equity and/or debt financings. In our\nview, the availability of capital will be affected by, among other things, capital market conditions, the success of our PARA\nOPS system commercialization efforts, timing for winning new customer contracts, potential acquisitions, and other relevant\nconsiderations (see Risk Factors). In the event we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our existing shareholders\nwill likely experience dilution, and any additional incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service\nobligations and could require us to agree to operational and financial covenants that could further restrict our operations. Any\nfailure to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all may require us to significantly change or curtail our current\nor planned operations in order to conserve cash until such time, if ever, that sufficient proceeds from operations are generated,\nand could result in us not being in a position to advance our commercialization strategy or take advantage of business\nopportunities.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the respective periods:\nYear ended Year ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ (4,256,596) $ (6,255,213) $ (1,791,654)\nInvesting activities (1,113,793) (1,073,192) (390,972)\nFinancing acitivities 2,852,829 6,942,750 5,234,771\nNet cash outflows $ (2,517,560) $ (385,655) $ 3,052,145\nCash, beginning of period 2,688,105 3,073,760 21,615\nCash, end of period $ 170,545 $ 2,688,105 $ 3,073,760\nCash used by operating activities\nWith the additional capital raised in the last three years, we continued to invest significantly across the organization and in\nproduct development. As an early-stage company with various products in the pipeline (pre-commercialization phase), our\nrevenue remains low and insufficient to cover the increase in our overhead costs, professional fees, advertising and promotion\ncosts, and R&D costs. As a result, cash flow used in operating activities was $4.3 million, $6.3 million, and $1.8 million for\nfiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nCash used by investing activities\nCash flow used in investing activities was $1.1 million for Fiscal 2022, consistent with prior year. In Fiscal 2022, we\ncontinued to make investments in the product development of our PARA OPS and Phantom systems. We also acquired Police\nOrdnance which resulted in assuming cash of $0.2 million at closing.\nCash flow used in investing activities for Fiscal 2021 was higher than for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, mainly\ndue significant investments made in sales demonstration units for TASCS IFM, and to a lesser extent to a $0.15 million\ndeposit made to DEFSEC as an advance on future royalties. The $0.4 million investment in Fiscal 2020 includes investments\nin capitalized developments projects and the cash consideration for the acquisition of the Phantom system from SageGuild\nLLC (“SageGuild”).\n11 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nCash provided by financing activities\nThe $2.8 million cash provided by our financing activities for Fiscal 2022 was lower than the $6.9 million in the prior year\nprimarily due to very challenging equity market conditions in the last nine months of Fiscal 2022. During Fiscal 2022, our\nfinancing was driven mainly from $2.5 million in borrowings, whereas in the prior year we raised $6 million in gross proceeds\nfrom selling Common Shares and warrants in private placements. Proceeds from exercise of warrants and stock options also\ndeclined by $1.5 million from last year due to the significant decline in the price of our common stock on the TSX Venture\nExchange (the “TSX-V”).\nThe $1.7 million increase in cash provided by financing activities in Fiscal 2021 over Fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by\n$1.8 million of proceeds from exercised stock options and warrants over the comparable period in light of the favorable\nmovement in the price of the Common Shares since going public in Canada in late Fiscal 2020. In Fiscal 2021, we raised net\nproceeds of $5.4 million from equity offerings, slightly ahead of the $5.3 million raised in the prior period. We also repaid\n$0.2 million of related party loans during Fiscal 2021, compared to $0.08 million in the prior period (see Related Party\nTransactions).\nCapital Resources\nOur objective in managing its capital is to safeguard KWESST’s ability to continue as a going concern and to sustain future\ndevelopment of the business. Our senior management is responsible for managing the capital through regular review of\nfinancial information to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet operating requirements and investments to support\nits growth strategy. Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing this process. From time to time, we could issue new\nCommon Shares or debt to maintain or adjust our capital structure. We are not subject to any externally imposed capital\nrequirements.\nOur primary sources of capital to date have been from borrowings, security offerings, exercise of stock options and warrants,\nand, to a lesser extent, pre-commercial revenue.

In the U.S. IPO, we sold 2,500,000 units at a public offering price of USD $4.13 per unit (the\n“Unit”), consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock (“Warrant”). The\nWarrants have a per share exercise price of USD $5.00, can be exercised immediately, and expire five years from the date of\nissuance. In connection with the closing of the U.S. IPO, the underwriter partially exercised its over-allotment option to\npurchase an additional 199,000 pre-funded common share purchase warrants and 375,000 warrants to purchase Common\nShares. The underwriter has the right to exercise the balance of its over-allotment option within the 45-day period.\n13 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nIn the Canadian Offering, we sold 726,392 units, each consisting of one Common Share and one warrant to purchase one\nCommon Share, at a price to the public of USD $4.13 per unit. The warrants will have a per Common Share exercise price\nof USD $5.00, are exercisable immediately and expire five years from the date of issuance.\nThe closing of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of USD $14,145,000, before\ndeducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.\nThe Common Shares of KWESST and the Warrants sold in the U.S. IPO began trading on Nasdaq under the symbols “KWE”\nand “KWESW”, respectively, on December 7, 2022.\nThinkEquity acted as sole book-running manager for the U.S. IPO and PI Financial acted as sole book-running manager for\nthe Canadian Offering.\nAs consideration for the services provided in connection with the U.S. IPO, ThinkEquity received: (a) a broker-dealer cash\ncommission of approximately US$835,000 equal to 7.5% of the gross offering proceeds of the U.S. Offering and (b)\nunderwriter warrants (the “Underwriter Warrants”) to purchase up to 134,950 Common Shares equal to 5% of the Common\nShares and pre-funded common share purchase warrants issued under the U.S. Offering. Each Underwriter Warrant is\nexercisable to acquire one Common Share at a price of US$5.1625, exercisable as of June 4, 2023, and expiring December\n4, 2027.\nAs consideration for the services provided in connection with the Canadian Offering, PI Financial received: (a) a cash\ncommission of approximately US$210,000 equal to 7% of the gross proceeds of the Offering; and (b) 50,848 compensation\noptions (the “Compensation Options”) equal to 7% of the number of Units issued under the Canadian Offering. Each\nCompensation Option is exercisable to acquire one Canadian Unit at a price of US$4.13 for a period of two years after the\nclosing of the Canadian Offering.\nThe total estimated offering costs were approximately USD$2.1 million for the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, of which\n$0.6 million was incurred and deferred at September 30, 2022.\nAccordingly, the estimated net proceeds from the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering was $11 million.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe following table illustrates the estimated use of the combined net proceeds from the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering\nover the next 12 months:\n14 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nUse of Net Proceeds (1) In U.S. Dollars\nRepayment of non-secured borrowings:\nIssued in March 2022 (2) $1,460,000\nIssued in August 2022 (3) $220,000\nCEBA loans (4) $51,000\nProduct development $529,000\nCorporate, general & administration, and working capital:\nGeneral and administrative $2,469,000\nSelling and marketing $1,355,000\nResearch and development, net $296,000\nNegative working capital at September 30, 2022 (excluding\n$2,286,226\nabove loans)\nUnallocated working capital $2,297,213\nTotal use of net proceeds $10,963,439\n(1) For Canadian dollars denominated expenses, the amounts were converted at a rate of $1.37 to US$1.00 on as reported by the Bank of Canada on\nDecember 16, 2022.\n(2) The net proceeds were used to fund the Corporation’s working capital.\n(3) On December 13, 2022, one of the two non-secured loans issued in August 2022 was settled for KWESST Units (same terms as those Units\noffered in the Canadian Offering).\n(4) This is net of $23,077 forgivable amount as we have repaid the CEBA loans due to the Canadian Government the repayment deadline for the\nforgivable amount.\nWe may also use a portion of the net proceeds from the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering for acquisitions or strategic\ninvestments in complementary businesses or technologies. We do not currently have any plans for any such acquisitions or\ninvestments and have not allocated specific amounts of net proceeds for any of these purposes.\nThe actual allocation of the net proceeds may vary depending on future developments in our business or unforeseen events.\nPending such application of the net proceeds of the U.S. IPO and Canadian Offering, we may elect to invest such funds, in\nwhole or in part, in short-term investment-grade securities or bank deposits.

This was primarily due to the acquisition of Police Ordnance in December 2021 which contributed $132.5 thousand\nof revenue to our fourth quarter Fiscal 2022.\nOperating expenses declined by 21% to $2.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, over the same quarter in\nFiscal 2021. The decline was driven mainly by the 72% reduction in selling and marketing costs primarily due to lower\nshare-based compensation and a decrease in investor relations and promotion spend. This was partially offset by an increase\nof 31% in general and administrative costs primarily due to the accrued bonuses to our employees and management and\nincreased regulatory and compliance fees as a result of becoming a United States issuer, offset by lower share-based\ncompensation fees.\nAs a result of the above, our net loss was $2.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, a 19% improvement over\nthe fourth quarter in Fiscal 2021.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our results\nof operations, financial condition, revenues or expenses, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nFor the last three fiscal years, we had the following related party transactions:\nEmployment and Consulting Agreements\nWe have entered into employment and consulting agreements with key management. Refer to Note 11 of Fiscal 2022 FS\nfor total compensation paid to key management personnel.\nDEFSEC Purchase Agreement\nEntering into the DEFSEC Purchase Agreement by us for the acquisition of the PARA OPS system was considered to be a\n“related-party transaction” for purposes of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in\nSpecial Transactions (“MI 61-101”) and Policy 5.9 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions of the\nTSXV. We relied on exemptions from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements available under\nMI 61-101. We were exempt from the formal valuation requirement in section 5.4 of MI 61-101 in reliance on sections 5.5(a)\nand (b) of MI 61-101 as the fair market value of the transaction was not more than the 25% of our market capitalization, and\nno securities of ours were listed or quoted for trading on prescribed stock exchanges or stock markets. Additionally, we were\nexempt from minority shareholder approval requirement in section 5.6 of MI 61-101 in reliance on section 5.7(a) as the fair\nmarket value of the transaction was not more than the 25% of our market capitalization. The transaction was reviewed and\napproved by our independent directors and we obtained approval from over 51% of disinterested shareholders. Further, on\nFebruary 19, 2021, the TSXV conditionally approved this asset acquisition. We closed the PARA OPS system acquisition\nshortly after closing the brokered private placement in April 2021.\nVoting Agreement\nOn September 14, 2020, we entered into a voting agreement with Messrs. Luxton and MacLeod, pursuant to which Messrs.\nLuxton and MacLeod agreed to vote the voting securities of the Company they own and exercise voting control over to ensure\nthat the following individuals are members of our Board of Directors: Mr. Luxton, Mr. MacLeod, one person nominated by\nMr. Luxton who is from the capital markets industry, one independent person nominated by Mr. Luxton and one independent\nperson nominated by Mr. MacLeod. Further, Messrs. Luxton and MacLeod irrevocably appointed our President as their proxy\nand granted our President power of attorney to vote their voting securities in a manner described in the voting agreement\nshould either Mr. Luxton or Mr. MacLeod fail to vote or attempt to vote in a manner inconsistent with the voting agreement.\nThis voting agreement expired on March 31, 2022.\n18 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nRelated Party Loans\nWe have not entered into related party loans during Fiscal 2022.\nDuring Fiscal 2021, we repaid all prior related party loans for source of new equity financing. Refer to Note 11 of Fiscal\n2022 FS for tabular disclosure showing the activities during the fiscal year.\nOther Related Party Transactions\nIn November 2019, we hired SageGuild to assist us in promoting our product offerings in the United States. From January\n28, 2021, to June 24, 2022, the CEO and sole shareholder of SageGuild agreed to serve as director of KWESST Defense\nSystems U.S. Inc. and as a result SageGuild was a related party to KWESST for this period. The total cash and share-based\nremuneration amounted to $251,809 for the nine months ended June 30, 2022 and $339,309 in Fiscal 2021. Except for the\ncash consideration recorded at the exchange amount, the share-based compensation was recorded at fair value.\nFor other immaterial related party transactions, refer to Note 11 of Fiscal 2021 FS.\nTerms and conditions of transactions with related parties\nTransactions with related parties are conducted on terms pursuant to an agreement and approved by our Board of Directors.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS\nWe recognize financial assets and liabilities when we become party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. On initial\nrecognition, financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the financial\nassets and liabilities, except for financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, whereby the transactions\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nRefer to Note 22 of Fiscal 2022 FS for comprehensive disclosure on our financial instruments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe following is a summary of critical accounting policies, requiring management to make significant estimates and\nassumptions:\nRevenue\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of products or services to customers at an amount that reflects the transaction\nprice we expect to receive in exchange for the products or services. Our contracts with customers may include the delivery\nof multiple products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance\nobligations. The accounting for a contract or contracts with a customer that contain multiple performance obligations requires\nus to allocate the contract or contracts transaction price to the identified distinct performance obligations.\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized, for each performance obligation, either over a period of time or at a\npoint in time, depending on which method reflects the transfer of control of the goods or services underlying the particular\nobligation to the customer.\nFor performance obligations satisfied over time, we recognize revenue over time using an input method, based on costs\nincurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion, to measure progress toward satisfying such performance\nobligation (for non-recurring engineering services, the input method is based on hours). Under this method, costs that do not\ncontribute to our performance in transferring control of goods or services to the customer are excluded from the measurement\n19 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nof progress toward satisfying the performance obligation. In certain other situations, we might recognize revenue at a point\nin time, when the criteria to recognize revenue over time are not met. In any event, when the total anticipated costs exceed\nthe total anticipated revenues on a contract, such loss is recognized in its entirety in the period it becomes known. Refer to\nNote 17 of Fiscal 2022 FS for tabular disclosure on timing of revenue recognition.\nWe may enter into contractual arrangements with a customer to deliver services on one project with respect to more than one\nperformance obligation, such as non-recurring engineering, procurement, and training. When entering into such\narrangements, we allocate the transaction price by reference to the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation.\nAccordingly, when such arrangements exist on the same project, the value of each performance obligation is based on its\nstand-alone price and recognized according to the respective revenue recognition methods described above. For example, for\nnon-recurring engineering services rendered over a contract period the revenue is recognized using the percentage of\ncompletion method; whereas for training services the revenue is recognized after the training is delivered (i.e. point in time).\nWe account for a contract modification, which consists of a change in the scope or price (or both) of a contract, as a separate\ncontract when the remaining goods or services to be delivered after the modification are distinct from those delivered prior\nto the modification and the price of the contract increases by an amount of consideration that reflects our stand-alone selling\nprice of the additional promised goods or services. When the contract modification is not accounted for as a separate contract,\nwe recognize an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis at the date of contract modification. There was no\ncontract modification in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nThe timing of revenue recognition often differs from performance payment schedules, resulting in revenue that has been\nearned but not billed. These amounts are included in unbilled receivables. At September 30, 2022, and 2021, we had an\nimmaterial amount and $0.3 million of unbilled receivable, respectively. Amounts billed in accordance with customer\ncontracts, but not yet earned, are recorded and presented as part of contract liabilities. There was no outstanding contract\nliability at September 30, 2021. At September 30, 2022, we had $47 thousand of contract liabilities (none at September 30,\n2021).\nWhen a contract includes a significant financing component, the value of such component is excluded from the transaction\nprice and is recognized separately as finance income or expense, as applicable.\nAccounting for acquisitions and contingent consideration\nDuring Fiscal 2022, we acquired Police Ordnance and accounted for it pursuant to IFRS 3, Business Combinations. Areas of\nsignificant estimation in connection with the accounting of this transaction included:\n• the estimated fair value of raw and work-in-progress inventories and intangible assets for the purchase price\nallocation; and\n• the volatility assumption used in the Black Scholes option model to estimate the fair value of the warrants issued\nto the selling shareholders given our short history as a public company.\nDuring Fiscal 2021, we acquired the PARA OPS system and accounted for it pursuant to IFRS 2, Share-Based Payment.\nAreas of significant estimation in connection with the acquisition of the PARA OPS system included:\n• the determination of the discount rate for the present value of the minimum annual royalty payments to\nDEFSEC; and\n• the volatility assumption used in the Black Scholes option model to estimate the fair value of the warrants issued\nto DEFSEC given our short history as a public company (see Accounting for share-based compensation).\nFor further details on the above acquisitions, refer to Note 4 of the Fiscal 2022 FS.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nWe review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount\nmay not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The\nrecoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessing\n20 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nimpairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, referred as the cash\ngenerating unit (“CGU”).\nIn accordance with IFRS, if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a long-lived asset is less than the\ncarrying value of that asset, then we recognize an asset impairment charge. The impairment charge is determined based on\nthe excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value, which generally represents the discounted future cash flows from\nthat asset.\nBecause we are an early-commercial stage technology company, management exercises significant judgment in establishing\nkey assumptions and estimates to determine the recoverable amount of our CGU, including future cash flows based on\nhistorical and budgeting operating results, growth rates, tax rates, and appropriate after-tax discount rates. The actual results\nmay vary and may cause significant adjustments in future periods.\nImpairment of non-financial assets\nWe review non-financial assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of\nthe assets may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the respective non-financial asset is less than our carrying amount,\nit is considered to be impaired. Management exercises significant judgement in estimating the recoverable amount for non-\nfinancial assets (see Impairment of long-lived assets).\nAccounting for share-based compensation\nWe measure share-based compensation at fair value. Key inputs in the Black Scholes option model is the volatility\nassumption, forfeiture rate, and expected life of our Common Shares. Due to our limited trading history, management has\nestablished a relevant peer group of listed companies and selected the weighted average of their volatilities over a period of\nthree to five years, where available. Starting in Fiscal 2021, we have commenced to incorporate a percentage of our stock\nvolatility in the overall calculation of the volatility assumption. We expect to solely rely on our stock volatility by the end of\nFiscal 2023 to estimate the fair value of share-based compensation as well as for warrants. As a result of our limited trading\nhistory, we have assumed a forfeiture rate of 0%, which will be reassessed annually. The expected life is estimated based on\nour trading history.\nAccounting for Unsecured Loans\nDue to the issuance of bonus Common Shares as part of the unsecured loans transactions during Fiscal 2022, we are required\nto allocate a percentage of the gross proceeds between the bonus Common Shares and the debt component based on their\nrelative fair value. To measure the fair value of the unsecured loans, we used the income approach and estimated a market\ndiscount rate ranging from 22% - 24% to discount the future cash flows of the unsecured loans. Management selected a\ndiscount rate based on review of the debt cost for comparable public companies.\nFor further information on the unsecured loans, see Note 12 of the Fiscal 2022 FS.\nBroker compensation options\nAs a result of the private placement in April 2021, we issued broker compensation options. To measure the fair value of the\nbroker compensation options, we used the Monte Carlo valuation model and exercised judgment in estimating the life, risk\nfree rate, and volatility.\nFor further information on the broker compensation options see Note 15(c) of the Fiscal 2022 FS.\n21 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL\nREPORTING\nDisclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) are intended to provide reasonable assurance that material information is\ngathered and reported to senior management to permit timely decisions regarding public disclosure. Internal controls over\nfinancial reporting (“ICFR”) are intended to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS accounting principles.\nTSX Venture-listed companies are not required to provide representations in their annual and interim filings relating to the\nestablishment and maintenance of DC&P and ICFR, as defined in Multinational Instrument MI 52-109. In particular, the\nCEO and CFO certifying officers do not make any representations relating to the establishment and maintenance of (a)\ncontrols and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the issuer\nin its annual filings, interim filings or other reports filed or submitted under securities legislation is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities legislation, and (b) processes to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with the issuer’s GAAP.\nAs previously noted in this MD&A, on December 7, 2022, we began trading on Nasdaq and as a result we are no longer a\nventure issuer. Consequently, the above exemption will no longer apply for future annual and interim filings.\nRISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of risks that may have a material and adverse impact on our future operating and financial performance\nand could cause our operating and financial performance to differ materially from the estimates described in our forward-\nlooking statements. These include widespread risks associated with any form of business and specific risks associated with\nour business and our involvement in the defense technology industry.\nThis section describes risk factors identified as being potentially significant to us. In addition, other risks and uncertainties\nnot discussed to date or not known to management could have material and adverse effects on the existing business activities,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, plans and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe are an early-commercial stage company.\nWe are an early-commercial stage company and as such, we are subject to many risks including under-capitalization, cash\nshortages, and limitations with respect to personnel, financial and other resources and the lack of revenue. There is no\nassurance that we will be successful in achieving a return on shareholders’ investment and the likelihood of success must be\nconsidered in light of our early stage of operations. Our prospects must be considered speculative in light of the risks,\nexpenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operations, particularly in the highly\ncompetitive and rapidly evolving markets in which we operate. To attempt to address these risks, we must, among other\nthings, successfully implement our business plan, marketing, and commercialization strategies, respond to competitive\ndevelopments, and attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. A substantial risk is involved in investing in us because,\nas a smaller commercial enterprise that has fewer resources than an established company, our management may be more\nlikely to make mistakes, and we may be more vulnerable operationally and financially to any mistakes that may be made, as\nwell as to external factors beyond our control.\nWe currently have negative operating cash flows.\nSince inception, we have generated significant negative cash flow from operations, financed in great part through equity\nfinancing. There can be no certainty that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flow from our operating\n22 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nactivities. In addition, our working capital and funding needs may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors\nincluding, but not limited to:\n• progress of our manufacturing, licensing, and distribution activities;\n• collaborative license agreements with third parties;\n• opportunities to license-in beneficial technologies or potential acquisitions;\n• potential milestone or other payments that we may make to licensors or corporate partners;\n• technological and market consumption and distribution models or alternative forms of proprietary technology for\ngame-changing applications in the military and homeland security market that affect our potential revenue levels or\ncompetitive position in the marketplace;\n• the level of sales and gross profit;\n• costs associated with production, labor, and services costs, and our ability to realize operation and production\nefficiencies;\n• fluctuations in certain working capital items, including product inventory, short-term loans, and accounts receivable,\nthat may be necessary to support the growth of our business; and\n• expenses associated with litigation.\nThere is no guarantee that we will ever become profitable. To date, we have generated limited revenues and a large portion\nof our expenses are fixed, including expenses related to facilities, equipment, contractual commitments and personnel. With\nthe anticipated commercialization for certain of our product offerings during Fiscal 2023, we expect our net losses from\noperations will improve. Our ability to generate additional revenues and potential to become profitable will depend largely\non the timely productization of our products, coupled with securing timely, cost-effective outsourced manufacturing\narrangements and marketing our products. There can be no assurance that any such events will occur or that we will ever\nbecome profitable. Even if we achieve profitability, we cannot predict the level of such profitability. If we sustain losses over\nan extended period of time, we may be unable to continue our business.\nGlobal inflationary pressure may have an adverse impact on our gross margins and our business.\nSince December 31, 2021, we have experienced increases in global inflation, resulting in an increase in cost for some of the\nraw materials (batons / custom chemicals and casings) that we source to manufacture the ammunition for our ARWEN\nlaunchers. However, this increase in cost had a small negative impact to the overall gross margin earned from the sales of\nARWEN ammunition during Fiscal 2022 (our current gross margin for ammunition is greater than 30% excluding indirect\ncosts).\nAs we are not yet in the production phase for digitization and counter-threat business lines, we do not currently procure large\nvolume of raw materials and therefore the current inflation is negligible for these business lines except for labor costs relating\nto research and development (“R&D”) activities. During Fiscal 2022, we incurred significant payroll cost increases for some\nof our employees in order to retain and hire engineers given the strong local demand for experienced software and hardware\nengineers. While we believe we will be able to pass on this inflation cost to our prospect military customers, there is no\nassurance that we will succeed. Accordingly, continued inflationary pressure may have an adverse impact on our gross\nmargins and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe coronavirus may adversely impact our business.\nAs of the date of this MD&A, markets, governments and health organizations around the world continue to work to contain\nthe outbreak of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”). COVID-19 may present a wide range of potential issues or disruptions in our\nbusiness and the business of third parties who we depend on or might depend in the future for materials and manufacturing,\nmost of which we are not able to know the full extent of at the time of this MD&A. These disruptions could include disruptions\nof our ability to receive timely materials, manufacture our products, or distribute our products, as well as closures of our\nprimary facility in Ottawa, Ontario or the facilities of our suppliers, manufacturers, and customers. Any disruption of the\nbusiness of our suppliers, manufacturers, or customers would likely impact our sales and operating results. Additionally, a\nsignificant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases (including COVID-19) could result in a widespread health\n23 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\ncrisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn\nthat could affect demand for our products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWhile COVID-19 has not had a material impact to our business to date, the following is a summary of what we believe may\nimpact our future business given the persistency of COVID-19: disruptions to business operations resulting from quarantines\nof employees, customers, manufacturers and other third-party service providers in areas affected by the outbreak; disruptions\nto business operations resulting from travel restrictions, including travel to industry tradeshows; and uncertainty around the\nduration of the virus’ impact.\nDespite the global vaccination efforts underway, the extent to which COVID-19 could impact our operations, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and cash flows is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Negative financial results,\nuncertainties in the market, and a tightening of credit markets, caused by COVID-19, or a recession, could have a material\nadverse effect on our liquidity and ability to obtain financing in the future.\nMoreover, if a pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease, including COVID-19, or other public health crisis\nwere to affect our facilities, staff, auditors, or advisors, our business could be adversely and materially affected. Such a\npandemic could result in mandatory social distancing, travel bans, and quarantine restrictions, and this may limit access to\nour employees and professional advisors, and consequently may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations\nwith regulatory authorities.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our business plan.\nThe execution of our business plan poses many challenges and is based on a number of assumptions. We may not be able to\nsuccessfully execute our business plan. If we experience significant cost overruns, or if our business plan is more costly than\nwe anticipate, certain activities may be delayed or eliminated, resulting in changes or delays to our current plans. Also, we\nmay be compelled to secure additional funding (which may or may not be available or available at conditions unfavorable to\nus) to execute our business plan. We cannot predict with certainty our future revenues or results from our operations. If the\nassumptions on which our revenues or expenditures forecasts are based change, the benefits of our business plan may change\nas well. In addition, we may consider expanding our business beyond what is currently contemplated in our business plan.\nDepending on the financing requirements of a potential business expansion, we may be required to raise additional capital\nthrough the issuance of equity or debt. If we are unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, we may be unable to\npursue a potential business expansion.\nA significant portion of our revenues are non-recurring.\nA significant portion of our revenue for Fiscal 2021and Fiscal 2022 was prior to commercial production for certain products\nand considered to be non-recurring. While we expect to reach commercialization stage for certain product offerings during\nFiscal 2023, there is no assurance we will succeed.\nWith the completion of the PARA OPS system technology acquisition in April 2021, we expect to launch the\ncommercialization of our non-lethal PARA OPS devices during Fiscal 2023 which we anticipate will drive product revenue\nthrough the use of distributors and an e-commerce platform. However, there is no assurance that we will successfully\ncomplete timely the productization of our PARA OPS or obtain market acceptance of these products.\nThere is uncertainty with respect to our revenue growth.\nThere can be no assurance that we can generate substantial revenue growth, or that any revenue growth that is achieved can\nbe sustained. Revenue growth that we have achieved or may achieve may not be indicative of future operating results. In\naddition, we may further increase our operating expenses in order to fund higher levels of research and development, increase\nour sales and marketing efforts and increase our administrative resources in anticipation of future growth. To the extent that\nincreases in such expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by increased revenues, our business, operating results\nand financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\n24 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nWe may not be able to fully develop our products, which could prevent us from ever becoming profitable.\nIf we experience difficulties in the development process, such as capacity constraints, quality control problems or other\ndisruptions, we may not be able to fully develop market-ready commercial products at acceptable costs, which would\nadversely affect our ability to effectively enter the market. A failure by us to achieve a low-cost structure through economies\nof scale or improvements in manufacturing processes would have a material adverse effect on our commercialization plans\nand our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may experience delays in product sales due to marketing and distribution capabilities.\nIn order to successfully commercialize our products, we must continue to develop our internal marketing and sales force with\ntechnical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities or arrange for third parties to perform these services. In order\nto successfully commercialize any of our products, we must have an experienced sales and distribution infrastructure. The\ncontinued development of our sales and distribution infrastructure will require substantial resources, which may divert the\nattention of our management and key personnel and defer our product development and commercialization efforts. To the\nextent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies, our revenues will depend on the efforts of\nothers.\nAdditionally, in marketing our products, we would likely compete with companies that currently have extensive and well-\nfunded marketing and sales operations. Despite marketing and sales efforts, we may be unable to compete successfully against\nthese companies. We may not be able to do so on favorable terms.\nIn the event we fail to develop substantial sales, marketing and distribution channels, or to enter into arrangements with third\nparties for those purposes, we will experience delays in product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on prospects,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThere is no assurance that our products will be accepted in the marketplace or that we will turn a profit or generate\nimmediate revenues.\nThere is no assurance as to whether our products will be accepted in the marketplace. While we believe our products address\ncustomer needs, the acceptance of our products may be delayed or not materialize. We have incurred and anticipate incurring\nsubstantial expenses relating to the development of our products, the marketing of our products and initial operations of our\nbusiness. Our revenues and possible profits will depend upon, among other things, our ability to successfully market our\nproducts to customers. There is no assurance that revenues and profits will be generated.\nStrategic alliances may not be achieved or achieve their goals.\nTo achieve a scalable operating model with minimal capital expenditures, we plan to rely upon strategic alliances with OEMs\nfor the manufacturing and distribution of our products. There can be no assurance that such strategic alliances can be achieved\nor will achieve their goals.\nWe are dependent on key suppliers for our ARWEN product line.\nWe purchase certain key components of our products from a limited number of suppliers for our ARWEN product line within\nour non-lethal business line. As of the date of this MD&A, we do not have any commercial or financial contracts with any\nkey suppliers who we have procured raw materials from. Procurement is done in the form of individual, non-related standard\npurchase orders. As a result, there is no contract in place to ensure sufficient quantities are available timely on favorable\nterms and consequently this could result in possible lost sales or uncompetitive product pricing. The ongoing COVID-19\npandemic could adversely impact the supply chain relating to these components.\n25 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nWe may incur higher costs or unavailability of components, materials and accessories.\nAs we expect to commercialize certain of our product lines in Fiscal 2023, we may depend on certain domestic and\ninternational suppliers for the delivery of components and materials used in the assembly of our products and certain\naccessories including ammunition, used with our products. Further, any reliance on third-party suppliers may create risks\nrelated to our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components or materials and reduced control over pricing\nand timing of delivery of components and materials. We currently have no long-term agreements with any of our suppliers\nand there is no guarantee the supply will not be interrupted.\nIn light of the current global supply chain challenges caused by COVID-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, components\nused in the manufacture of our products may be delayed, become unavailable or discontinued. Any delays may take weeks\nor months to resolve. Further, parts obsolescence may require us to redesign our product to ensure quality replacement\ncomponents. While we have not been impacted significantly from the above events to date, there is no assurance that we will\nnot experience significant setback in operations if the global supply chain challenges worsen or continue to persist for a longer\nperiod of time. Accordingly, supply chain delays could cause significant delays in manufacturing and loss of sales, leading\nto adverse effects significantly impacting our financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, our shipping costs and the timely delivery of our products could be adversely impacted by a number of factors\nwhich could reduce the profitability of our operations, including: higher fuel costs, potential port closures, customs clearance\nissues, increased government regulation or changes for imports of foreign products into Canada, delays created by terrorist\nattacks or threats, public health issues and pandemics and epidemics, national disasters or work stoppages, and other matters.\nAny interruption of supply for any material components of our products could significantly delay the shipment of our products\nand have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\nWe rely upon a limited number of third parties for manufacturing, shipping, transportation, logistics, marketing and sales\nof our products.\nWe rely on third parties to ship, transport, and provide logistics for our products. Further, we plan on relying on third parties\nto manufacture, market and sell our PARA OPS system products. Our dependence on a limited number of third parties for\nthese services leaves us vulnerable due to our need to secure these parties’ services on favorable terms. Loss of, or an adverse\neffect on, any of these relationships or failure of any of these third parties to perform as expected could have a material and\nadverse effect on our business, sales, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation.\nWe may be subject to product liability proceedings or claims.\nWe may be subject to proceedings or claims that may arise in the ordinary conduct of the business, which could include\nproduct and service warranty claims, which could be substantial. Product liability for us is a major risk as some of our products\nwill be used by military personnel in theaters-of-war (for the Tactical and Counter-Threat product offerings) and by\nconsumers and law enforcement (for the non-lethal systems). The occurrence of product defects due to non-compliance of\nour manufacturing specifications and the inability to correct errors could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of\nour products, material warranty expense, diversion of technological and other resources from our product development\nefforts, and the loss of credibility with customers, manufacturers’ representatives, distributors, value-added resellers, systems\nintegrators, original equipment manufacturers and end-users, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results and financial conditions. To mitigate product liability risk, our products will be sold with a liability\ndisclaimer for misuse of the product.\nIf we are unable to successfully design and develop or acquire new products, our business may be harmed.\nTo maintain and increase sales we must continue to introduce new products and improve or enhance our existing products or\nnew products. The success of our new and enhanced products depends on many factors, including anticipating consumer\n26 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\npreferences, finding innovative solutions to consumer problems or acquiring new solutions through mergers and acquisitions,\ndifferentiating our products from those of our competitors, and maintaining the strength of our brand. The design and\ndevelopment of our products as well as acquisitions of other businesses.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products or our results of operations.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we forecast inventory needs and often place orders with our manufacturers before we\nreceive firm orders from our retail partners or customers. If we fail to accurately forecast demand, we may experience excess\ninventory levels or a shortage of product.\nIf we underestimate the demand for our products, we or our suppliers may not be able to scale to meet our demand, and this\ncould result in delays in the shipment of our products and our failure to satisfy demand, as well as damage to our reputation\nand retail partner relationships. If we overestimate the demand for our products, we could face inventory levels in excess of\ndemand, which could result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices,\nwhich would harm our gross margins. In addition, failures to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could\ncause a decline in sales and harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we may not be able to accurately forecast our results of operations and growth rate. Forecasts may be particularly\nchallenging as we expand into new markets and geographies and develop and market new products for which we have no or\nlimited historical data. Our historical sales, expense levels, and profitability may not be an appropriate basis for forecasting\nfuture results. Our lack of historical data related to new products makes it particularly difficult to make forecasts related to\nsuch products. The lead times and reliability of our suppliers has been inconsistent as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic\nand may be affected by global events in the future. These effects are expected to last through the remainder of the pandemic.\nPandemic related variances require a very quick pivot and adjustments to the supply chain, production and marketing. If we\nare unable to make these changes quickly or at all our inventory, production and sales may be materially affected.\nFailure to accurately forecast our results of operations and growth rate could cause us to make poor operating decisions that\nwe may not be able to correct in a timely manner. Consequently, actual results could be materially different than anticipated.\nEven if the markets in which we compete expand, we cannot assure you that our business will grow at similar rates, if at all.\nUndetected flaws may be discovered in our products.\nThere can be no assurance that, despite testing by us, flaws will not be found in our products and services, resulting in loss\nof, or delay in, market acceptance. We may be unable, for technological or other reasons, to introduce products and services\nin a timely manner or at all in response to changing customer requirements. In addition, there can be no assurance that while\nwe are attempting to finish the development of our technologies, products and services, a competitor will not introduce similar\nor superior technologies, products and services, thus diminishing our advantage, rendering our technologies, products and\nservices partially or wholly obsolete, or at least requiring substantial re-engineering in order to become commercially\nacceptable. Failure by us to maintain technology, product and service introduction schedules, avoid cost overruns and\nundetected errors, or introduce technologies, products and services that are superior to competing technologies, products and\nservices would have a materially adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe will be reliant on information technology systems and may be subject to damaging cyber-attacks.\nWe use third parties for certain hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology (“IT”) services in\nconnection with our operations. Our operations depend, in part, on how well we and our suppliers protect networks,\nequipment, IT systems and software against damage from a number of threats, including, but not limited to, cable cuts,\ndamage to physical plants, natural disasters, intentional damage and destruction, fire, power loss, hacking, computer viruses,\nvandalism and theft. Our operations also depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks,\nequipment, IT systems and software, as well as pre-emptive expenses to mitigate the risks of failures. Any of these and other\nevents could result in information system failures, delays and/or increase in capital expenses. The failure of information\nsystems or a component of information systems could, depending on the nature of any such failure, adversely impact our\n27 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nreputation and results of operations. Moreover, failure to meet the minimum cybersecurity requirements for defense contracts\nmay disqualify us from participating in the tendering process. To date, we have not experienced any losses relating to cyber-\nattacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not incur such losses in the future.\nOur risk and exposure to these matters cannot be fully mitigated because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these\nthreats. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of controls, processes and practices\ndesigned to protect systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access is a priority.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance\nprotective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nIn certain circumstances, our reputation could be damaged.\nDamage to our reputation can be the result of the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, and could include\nany negative publicity, whether true or not. Reputational risk for us is a major risk as some of our products will be used by\nmilitary personnel in theaters-of-war or by law enforcement personnel. The increased usage of social media and other web-\nbased tools used to generate, publish and discuss user-generated content and to connect with other users has made it\nincreasingly easier for individuals and groups to communicate and share opinions and views regarding us and our activities,\nwhether true or not. Although we believe that we operate in a manner that is respectful to all stakeholders and that we take\ncare in protecting our image and reputation, we do not ultimately have direct control over how we are perceived by others.\nReputational loss may result in decreased investor confidence, increased challenges in developing and maintaining\ncommunity relations and an impediment to our overall ability to advance our projects, thereby having a material adverse\nimpact on financial performance, financial condition, cash flows and growth prospects.\nOur results of operations are difficult to predict and depend on a variety of factors.\nThere is no assurance that the production, technology acquisitions, and the commercialization of proprietary technology for\ngame-changing applications in the military, security forces and personal defense markets will be managed successfully. Any\ninability to achieve such commercial success could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\noperating results, liquidity, and prospects. In addition, the comparability of results may be affected by changes in accounting\nguidance or changes in our ownership of certain assets. Accordingly, the results of operations from year to year may not be\ndirectly comparable to prior reporting periods. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the results of operations may\nfluctuate significantly from period to period, and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results for any\nfuture period.\nProtecting and defending against intellectual property claims may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete depends, in part, upon successful protection of our intellectual property. While we have some patents\nand trademarks, we also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, which is inherently risky. Going forward, we will\nattempt to protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to our technologies through available copyright and trademark\nlaws, patents and licensing and distribution arrangements with reputable international companies in specific territories and\nmedia for limited durations. Despite these precautions, existing copyright, trademark and patent laws afford only limited\npractical protection in certain countries where we distribute our products. As a result, it may be possible for unauthorized\nthird parties to copy and distribute our products or certain portions or applications of our intended products, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects.\nLitigation may also be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the\nvalidity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such\nlitigation, infringement or invalidity claims could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects.\n28 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nWe face risks from doing business internationally.\nOur commercialization strategies for our products include sales efforts outside Canada and deriving revenues from\ninternational sources. As a result, our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business, many of which are\nbeyond our control.\nThese risks may include:\n• laws and policies affecting trade, investment and taxes, including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of\nfunds and withholding taxes, and changes in these laws;\n• anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that impose strict requirements on\nhow we conduct our foreign operations and changes in these laws and regulations;\n• changes in local regulatory requirements, including restrictions on content and differing cultural tastes and attitudes;\n• international jurisdictions where laws are less protective of intellectual property and varying attitudes towards the\npiracy of intellectual property;\n• financial instability and increased market concentration of buyers in foreign markets;\n• the instability of foreign economies and governments;\n• fluctuating foreign exchange rates;\n• the spread of communicable diseases in such jurisdictions, which may impact business in such jurisdictions; and\n• war and acts of terrorism.\nEvents or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues\nfrom non-Canadian sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results,\nliquidity, and prospects. Protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this\nprotection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities, and damage to our reputation.\nWe maintain information in digital form as necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary\ninformation and personal information regarding our employees.\nData maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering, and theft. We develop and maintain systems to\nprevent this from occurring, but it is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts\nto overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion,\ntampering, and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these acts remain. In addition, we provide\nconfidential information, digital content and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business\nobjectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, monitor\nthe protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk that data systems of these third parties may be compromised.\nIf our data systems or data systems of these third parties are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be\nimpaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and we may lose\nrevenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. A breach of our network security or other theft or misuse of\nconfidential and proprietary information, digital content or personal employee information could subject us to business,\nregulatory, litigation, and reputation risk, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur success depends on management and key personnel.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees. From time to\ntime, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which\ncould disrupt our business. If we are unable to attract and retain top talent, our ability to compete may be harmed. Our success\nis also highly dependent on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel.\nCompetition for highly skilled executives and other employees is high in our industry, especially from larger and better\ncapitalized defense and security companies. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Failure to\n29 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nattract and retain qualified executive officers and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nprospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur directors, officers or members of management may have conflicts of interest.\nCertain of our directors, officers, and other members of management serve (and may in the future serve) as directors, officers,\nand members of management of other companies and therefore, it is possible that a conflict may arise between their duties as\none of our directors, officers or members of management and their duties as a director, officer or member of management of\nsuch other companies. Our directors and officers are aware of the existence of laws governing accountability of directors and\nofficers for corporate opportunity and requiring disclosures by directors of conflicts of interest and we will rely upon such\nlaws in respect of any directors’ and officers’ conflicts of interest or in respect of any breaches of duty by any of our directors\nor officers. All such conflicts will be disclosed by such directors or officers in accordance with the BCBCA and they will\ngovern themselves in respect thereof to the best of their ability in accordance with the obligations imposed upon them by law.\nIt may not be possible for foreign investors to enforce actions against us, and our directors and officers.\nWe are a corporation organized under the laws of the Province of British Columbia and our Canadian subsidiaries are\norganized under the laws of the Province of Ontario and our United States subsidiaries are organized under the laws of\nDelaware. All of our directors and executive officers reside principally in Canada. Because all or a substantial portion of our\nassets and the assets of these persons are located in Canada, it may not be possible for foreign investors, including United\nStates investors, to effect service of process from outside of Canada upon us or those persons, or to realize in the United\nStates upon judgments of United States courts predicted upon civil liabilities under the Exchange Act or other United States\nlaws. Furthermore, it may not be possible to enforce against us foreign judgments obtained in courts outside of Canada based\nupon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws or other laws in those jurisdictions.\nAny disruption at our places of business could delay revenues or increase our expenses.\nMost of our operations are conducted at locations in the Province of Ontario. We maintain a significant business development\noperation in the United States, through our contractual relationship with SageGuild. A natural disaster, such as a fire, flood\nor earthquake, could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our offices, and cause us to incur additional\nexpenses.\nIn addition, because we do not maintain “key person” life insurance on any of our executive officers, employees or\nconsultants, any delay in replacing such persons, or an inability to replace them with persons of similar expertise, would have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur internal computer systems are vulnerable to damage and failure.\nDespite the implementation of security measures and backup storage, our internal computer systems are vulnerable to damage\nfrom computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failure.\nAny system failure, accident or security breach that causes interruption in our operations could result in a material disruption\nof our projects. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or applications, or\ninappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, our\ntechnology program may be adversely affected and the further development of our technology may be delayed. We may also\nincur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches.\nBusiness interruptions could adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations are vulnerable to outages and interruptions due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, and\nsimilar events beyond our control. Although we have developed certain plans to respond in the event of a disaster, there can\n30 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nbe no assurance that they will be effective in the event of a specific disaster. Any losses or damages incurred by us could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with possible acquisitions, licensing, business combinations, or joint ventures.\nWhile to date we have mainly focused on developing our own products, from time to time, we could be engaged in discussions\nand activities with respect to possible business and/or technology acquisitions or licensing, sale of assets, business\ncombinations, or joint ventures with the view of either complementing or expanding our internally developed products. These\nacquisitions and licensing activities are not crucial to our long-term business success. The anticipated benefit from any of the\ntransactions we may pursue may not be realized as expected. Regardless of whether any such transaction is consummated,\nthe negotiation of a potential transaction and the integration of the acquired business or technology, acquired or licensed,\ncould incur significant costs and cause diversion of management’s time and resources. Any such transaction could also result\nin impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, development write-offs, and other related expenses. Such transactions may\npose challenges in the consolidation and integration of information technology, accounting systems, personnel, and\noperations. We may have difficulty managing the combined entity in the short term if we experience a significant loss of\nmanagement personnel during the transition period after a significant acquisition. We may also have difficulty managing the\nproduct development and commercialization following a technology acquisition or licensing. No assurance can be given that\nexpansion, licensing or acquisition opportunities will be successful, completed on time, or that we will realize expected\noperating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits. Any of the foregoing could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects.\nClaims against us relating to any acquisition, licensing or business combination may necessitate seeking claims against\nthe seller for which the seller may not indemnify us or that may exceed the seller’s or licensor’s indemnification\nobligations.\nThere may be liabilities assumed in any technology acquisition or licensing or business combination that we did not discover\nor that we underestimated in the course of performing our due diligence. Although a seller or licensor generally will have\nindemnification obligations to us under a licensing, acquisition or merger agreement, these obligations usually will be subject\nto financial limitations, such as general deductibles and maximum recovery amounts, as well as time limitations. There is no\nassurance that our right to indemnification from any seller or licensors will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount,\nscope or duration to fully offset the amount of any undiscovered or underestimated liabilities that we may incur. Any such\nliabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects.\nGrowth may cause pressure on our management and systems.\nOur future growth may cause significant pressure on our management, and our operational, financial, and other resources and\nsystems. Our ability to manage our growth effectively will require that we implement and improve our operational, financial,\nmanufacturing, and management information systems, hire new personnel and then train, manage, and motivate these new\nemployees. These demands may require the hiring of additional management personnel and the development of additional\nexpertise within the existing management team. Any increase in resources devoted to production, business development, and\ndistribution efforts without a corresponding increase in our operational, financial, and management information systems could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may infringe intellectual property rights of third parties.\nFor certain of our product lines, we have elected to protect our technology and products as trade secrets as opposed to seeking\npatent protection. We may, in future, elect to seek patent protection for some of our future products. While we believe that\nour products and other intellectual property do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, our commercial success\ndepends, in part, upon us not infringing intellectual property rights of others. A number of our competitors and other third\nparties have been issued or may have filed patent applications or may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights for\n31 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\ntechnologies similar to those utilized by us. Some of these patents may grant very broad protection to the owners of the\npatents. While we have engaged external intellectual property legal counsels to undertake an extensive review of existing\nthird-party patents and prepare our patent applications for some of our products, there is no assurance that their reviews and\nconclusion will not prevail if challenged by a third party of an alleged infringement of their intellectual properties. We may\nbecome subject to claims by third parties that our technology infringes their intellectual property rights due to the growth of\nproducts in our target markets, the overlap in functionality of those products and the prevalence of products. We may become\nsubject to these claims either directly or through indemnities against these claims that we provide to end-users, manufacturer’s\nrepresentatives, distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators and original equipment manufacturers. Litigation may\nbe necessary to determine the scope, enforceability and validity of third-party proprietary rights or to establish our proprietary\nrights. Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated with companies having, substantially greater resources than we and\nthese competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for a\nlonger period of time than us. Regardless of their merit, any such claims could be time consuming to evaluate and defend,\nresult in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or stoppages, divert management’s attention and focus away from\nthe business, subject us to significant liabilities and equitable remedies, including injunctions, require that we enter into costly\nroyalty or licensing agreements and require that we modify or stop using infringing technology.\nWe may be prohibited from developing or commercializing certain technologies and products unless we obtain a license from\na third party. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms or\nat all. If we do not obtain such a license, we could be required to cease the sale of certain of our products.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nThe following risks relate specifically to Digitization and Counter-Threat business lines:\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States for our products designed for the military market.\nOur customers in the United States are global defense contractors and they are subject to various United States government\nregulations which some may be passed on to us in order for them to be compliant. The most significant regulations and\nregulatory authorities that may affect our future business include the following:\n• the Federal Acquisition Regulations and supplemental agency regulations, which comprehensively regulate the\nformation and administration of, and performance under, United States government contracts;\n• the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of all factual cost and pricing data in\nconnection with contract negotiations;\n• the False Claims Act and the False Statements Act, which impose penalties for payments made on the basis of false\nfacts provided to the government and on the basis of false statements made to the government, respectively;\n• the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits United States companies from providing anything of value to a\nforeign official to help obtain, retain or direct business, or obtain any unfair advantage; and\n• laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national\nsecurity purposes or determined to be “controlled unclassified information” and the exportation of certain products\nand technical data.\nOur failure to comply with applicable regulations, rules and approvals; changes in the United States government’s\ninterpretation of such regulations, rules and approvals as have been and are applied to our contracts, proposals or business or\nmisconduct by any of our employees could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the loss of security clearances, a\ndecrease in profitability, or the loss of our subcontract contracts with United States defense contractors generally, any of\nwhich could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n32 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nA decline in the United States and other government budgets, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, or delays in\ncontract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenue.\nSince inception, except for Fiscal 2022, most of our revenue was driven by contracts from the United States government,\nthrough United States prime defense contractors. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by government\nspending caps or changes in government budgetary priorities, as well by delays in the government budget process, program\nstarts, or the award of contracts or orders under existing contracts. As a result, the market for our military solution may be\nimpacted due to shifts in the political environment and changes in the government and agency leadership positions under the\nnew United States administration. If annual budget appropriations or continuing resolutions are not enacted timely, we could\nface United States government shutdown, which could adversely impact our business and our ability to receive indirectly\ntimely payment from United States government entities on future contracts.\nUnited States government contracts are generally not fully funded at inception and contain certain provisions that may be\nunfavorable to us.\nWe have entered into defense contracts with United States prime defense contractors, which it in turns transact directly with\nthe United States government.\nUnited States government contracts typically involve long lead times for design and development, and are subject to\nsignificant changes in contract scheduling. Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program\nmay continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially, and additional funds are\ncommitted only as Congress makes further appropriations. The termination or reduction of funding for a government program\nwould result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program. In addition, United States government\ncontracts generally contain provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, at the government’s convenience or for\ncontractor default.\nThe actual receipt of revenue on future awards subcontracted to us may never occur or may change because a program\nschedule could change or the program could be cancelled, or a contract could be reduced, modified or terminated early.\nWhile we had no outstanding United States government contracts (directly or indirectly) as of the date of this MD&A, we\nare exposed to the above risk for future United States government related contracts.\nWe may not be able to comply with changes in government policies and legislation.\nThe manufacture, sale, purchase, possession and use of weapons, ammunitions, firearms, and explosives are subject to federal,\nprovincial and foreign laws. If such regulation becomes more expansive in the future, it could have a material adverse effect\non our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. New legislation, regulations, or changes to or new\ninterpretations of existing regulation could impact our ability to manufacture or sell our products and our projectiles, or limit\ntheir market, which could impact our cost of sales and demand for our products. Similarly changes in laws related to the\ndomestic or international use of chemical irritants by civilians or law enforcement could impact both our cost of sales and the\nsize of our reachable market.\nWe may be subject, both directly and indirectly, to the adverse impact of existing and potential future government regulation\nof our products, technology, operations, and markets. For example, the development, production, exportation, importation,\nand transfer of our products and technology is subject to Canadian and provincial laws. Further, as we plan to conduct business\nin the United States, we will also be subject to United States and foreign export control, sanctions, customs, import and anti-\nboycott laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations (the “EAR”) (collectively, “Trade Control\nLaws”). If one or more of our products or technology, or the parts and components we buy from others, is or become subject\nto the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the “ITAR”) or national security controls under the EAR, this could\nsignificantly impact our operations, for example by severely limiting our ability to sell, export, or otherwise transfer our\nproducts or technology, or to release controlled technology to foreign person employees or others in the United States or\nabroad. We may not be able to retain licenses and other authorizations required under the applicable Trade Control Laws.\nThe failure to satisfy the requirements under the Trade Control Laws, including the failure or inability to obtain necessary\n33 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nlicenses or qualify for license exceptions, could delay or prevent the development, production, export, import, and/or in-\ncountry transfer of our products and technology, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nFailure by us, our employees, or others working on our behalf to comply with the applicable government policies and\nregulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including fines, suspension, debarment from bidding\nfor or performing government contracts, or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect\non us.\nThe following risk relates specifically to PARA OPS business line:\nWe will be subject to regulation in the United States for our non-lethal systems.\nWhile our PARA OPS devices are non-lethal (based on the kinetic energy of our projectiles), these are automatically classified\nas form of a firearm under the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (“ATF”) rules and regulations because\nwe use pyrotechnic based primers in our proprietary ammunition cartridges. We have therefore self-classified our .67 caliber\nPARA OPS devices as not only a firearm, but a “destructive device” in accordance with the ATF regulations. We intend to\nself-classify our other PARA OPS devices as a form of a firearm under ATF regulations until such time we have found an\nalternative for primers (i.e., a non-pyrotechnic energy actuator) to launch our projectiles, and therefore not be subject to ATF\nregulations. We currently have in development an alternative to replace the primer. While this developmental actuator\ntechnology appears promising, there is no assurance that we will succeed and consequently this may adversely affect our\nfuture revenues and related results of operations, business, prospects, and financial condition. Further, in the event we have\nimplemented an alternative to replace the primer and then self-classify our PARA OPS devices as “non-firearm”, there is no\nassurance that the ATF may not contest our self-classification, which could result in discontinuing sales to consumers with\nno firearm license where required by state law. Accordingly, this could also adversely affect our future revenues and related\nresults of operations, business, prospects, and financial condition.\nBecause our business model relies on outsourced production, we have no plans of becoming a firearm manufacturer in the\nUnited States but rather to continue to partner with licensed FFL manufacturer for the production and distribution of our\nPARA OPS products. Accordingly, post commercialization in the United States the burden to comply with ATF rules and\nregulations applicable to the manufacturing and distribution process will be with our FFL business partners. Our primary\nrisk of governmental interruption of manufacturing and distribution therefore lies within the operations and attendant internal\ncontrol environment of our FFL business partners.\nFurthermore, with respect to transfers to end users (government, military, or consumer), the obligation to comply with ATF\nrules and regulations and any applicable state laws resides with the downstream FFL wholesaler/distributor/retailer and any\npenalties levied upon such parties do not flow up the distribution chain.\nThe following risks apply to all business lines:\nRapid technological development could result in obsolescence or short product life cycles of our products.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards, which could\nresult in product obsolescence or short product life cycles. Accordingly, our success is dependent upon our ability to anticipate\ntechnological changes in the industries we serve and to successfully identify, obtain, develop and market new products that\nsatisfy evolving industry requirements. There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop new products or enhance\nand improve our existing products or that any new products and enhanced and improved existing products will achieve market\nacceptance. Further, there can be no assurance that competitors will not market products that have perceived advantages over\nour products or which render the products currently sold by us obsolete or less marketable.\nWe must commit significant resources to developing, testing and demonstrating new products before knowing whether our\ninvestments will result in products the market will accept. To remain competitive, we may be required to invest significantly\ngreater resources than currently anticipated in research and development and product enhancement efforts, and result in\nincreased operating expenses.\n34 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nOur industry is highly competitive.\nThe industry for military and security forces and personal defense is highly competitive and composed of many domestic and\nforeign companies. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience, substantial competition from numerous\ncompetitors whom we expect to continue to improve their products and technologies. Competitors may announce and\nintroduce new products, services or enhancements that better meet the needs of end-users or changing industry standards, or\nachieve greater market acceptance due to pricing, sales channels or other factors. With substantially greater financial\nresources and operating scale than we do currently, certain competitors may be able to respond more quickly than us to\nchanges in end-user requirements and devote greater resources to the enhancement, promotion and sale of their products.\nSuch competition could adversely affect our ability to win new contracts and sales.\nSince we operate in evolving markets, our business and future prospects may be difficult to evaluate.\nOur technological solutions are in new and rapidly evolving markets. The military, civilian public safety, professional and\npersonal defense markets we target are in early stages of customer adoption. Accordingly, our business and future prospects\nmay be difficult to evaluate. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which demand for our products and services will\ndevelop and/or increase, if at all. The challenges, risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly\nevolving markets could impact our ability to do the following:\n• generate sufficient revenue to obtain and/or maintain profitability;\n• acquire and maintain market share;\n• achieve or manage growth in operations;\n• develop and renew contracts;\n• attract and retain additional engineers and other highly-qualified personnel;\n• successfully develop and commercially market products and services;\n• adapt to new or changing policies and spending priorities of governments and government agencies; and\n• access additional capital when required or on reasonable terms.\nIf we fail to address these and other challenges, risks and uncertainties successfully, our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition would be materially harmed.\nUncertainty related to exportation could limit our operations in the future.\nWe must comply with Canadian federal and provincial laws regulating the export of our products. In some cases, explicit\nauthorization from the Canadian government is needed to export certain products. The export regulations and the governing\npolicies applicable to our business are subject to change. We cannot provide assurance that such export authorizations will\nbe available for our products in the future. To date, compliance with these laws has not significantly limited our operations,\nbut could significantly limit them in the future. Noncompliance with applicable export regulations could potentially expose\nus to fines, penalties and sanctions. If we cannot obtain required government approvals under applicable regulations, we may\nnot be able to sell our products in certain international jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, prospects,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal economic turmoil and regional economic conditions in the United States could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to the risks pertaining to COVID-19 disclosed above, global economic turmoil may cause a general tightening in\nthe credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, levels of intervention from the\nUnited States federal government and other foreign governments, decreased consumer confidence, overall slower economic\nactivity, and extreme volatility in credit, equity, and fixed income markets. A decrease in economic activity in the United\nStates or in other regions of the world in which we do business could adversely affect demand for our products, thus reducing\nour revenues and earnings. A decline in economic conditions could reduce sales of our products.\n35 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition\nWe face substantial capital requirements and financial risk.\nTo be successful, our business requires a substantial investment of capital. The production, acquisition, and distribution of\nproprietary technology for game-changing applications in the military and security forces and personal defense markets\nrequire substantial capital. A significant amount of time may elapse between our expenditure of funds and the receipt of\nrevenues. This may require a significant portion of funds from equity, credit, and other financing sources to fund the business.\nThere can be no assurance that these arrangements will continue to be successfully implemented or will not be subject to\nsubstantial financial risks relating to the production, acquisition, and distribution of proprietary technology for game-changing\napplications in the military and security forces and personal defense markets. In addition, if demand increases through internal\ngrowth or acquisition, there may be an increase to overhead and/or larger up-front payments for production and, consequently,\nthese increases bear greater financial risks. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects.\nWe may require additional capital which may result in dilution to existing shareholders.\nWe may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional funds to fund our working capital\nrequirement and business growth. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt\nsecurities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights,\npreferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of the Common Shares. Any debt financing secured by us in the future\ncould involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which\nmight make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.\nWe can provide no assurance that sufficient debt or equity financing will be available on reasonable terms or at all to support\nour business growth and to respond to business challenges and failure to obtain sufficient debt or equity financing when\nrequired could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash\nflows.\nOver the short-term, we expect to incur operating losses and generate negative cash flow until we can produce sufficient\nrevenues to cover our costs. We may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to\nsustain or increase our profitability in the future. There are substantial uncertainties associated with our ability to achieving\nand sustaining profitability. We expect our current cash position will be reduced due to future operating losses and working\ncapital requirements, and we cannot provide certainty as to how long our cash position will last or that we will be able to\naccess additional capital if and when necessary.\nExercise of options or warrants or vesting of restricted stock units will have a dilutive effect on your percentage ownership\nand will result in a dilution of your voting power and an increase in the number of Common Shares eligible for future resale\nin the public market, which may negatively impact the trading price of our Common Shares.\nThe release of securities currently held in escrow may adversely impact the price of our Common Shares or warrants.\nThe market price of our Common Shares or common share purchase warrants that were sold in the U.S. IPO and are listed\non Nasdaq (the “Warrants”) may be adversely impacted by the release of certain of our securities that are currently escrowed\nif the holders immediately trade these securities upon release. These securities are currently issued and outstanding but\nrestricted from trading. These will be released from escrow in lots on pre-determined dates.\nAs of December 22, 2022, we have 1,376 Common Shares subject to escrow conditions pursuant to the CPC Escrow\nAgreement, 2,750,000 Company 2024 Warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 39,285 Common Shares subject to escrow\nconditions pursuant to the Surplus Security Escrow Agreement, 113,435 Common Shares subject to escrow conditions\npursuant to the Surplus Security Escrow Agreement, 15,000 Common Shares subject to escrow conditions pursuant to the\n36 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nValue Security Escrow Agreement, and 1,050,000 Company 2024 Warrants exercisable for an aggregate 15,000 Common\nShares subject to escrow conditions pursuant to the Value Security Escrow Agreement (collectively, the “Escrowed\nSecurities”). The Escrowed Securities will be released in lots of 39,124 Common Shares and 1,275,000 Company 2024\nWarrants on March 18, 2023, and 90,686 Common Shares and 2,525,000 Company 2024 Warrants on September 18, 2023.\nWe may need to divest assets if there is insufficient capital.\nIf sufficient capital is not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, eliminate or divest one or more of our\nassets or products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, or results\nof operations.\nWe have broad discretion over the use of net proceeds from future capital raises.\nWe will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from any future capital raises. Because of the number and\nvariability of factors that will determine our use of such proceeds, the ultimate use might vary substantially from the planned\nuse. Investors may not agree with how we allocate or spend the proceeds from future capital raises. We may pursue\ncollaborations that ultimately do not result in an increase in the market value of the Common Shares and that instead increase\nour losses.\nCurrency fluctuations may have a material effect on us.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar, other currencies and the Canadian dollar may have a\nmaterial effect on our results of operations. To date, we have not engaged in currency hedging activities. To the extent that\nwe may seek to implement hedging techniques in the future with respect to our foreign currency transactions, there can be no\nassurance that we will be successful in such hedging activities.\nUnavailability of adequate director and officer insurance could make it difficult for us to retain and attract qualified\ndirectors and could also impact our liquidity.\nWe have directors and officers liability (“D&O”) insurance we believe to be adequate to cover risk exposure for us and our\ndirectors and officers, who we indemnify to the full extent permitted by law, there is no guaranty that such coverage will be\nadequate in the event of litigation.\nOur coverage needs for D&O insurance may change or increase in the future for various reasons including changes in our\nmarket capitalization, changes in trading volume or changes in the listing rules of exchanges or marketplaces on which our\nsecurities may trade from time to time. There is no guaranty that such coverage will be available or available at reasonable\nrates. While we have obtained new D&O insurance before completing the Nasdaq listing and may need to increase our D&O\ncoverage as needed in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so at reasonable rates or at all, or in\namounts adequate to cover expenses and liability should litigation occur. Without adequate D&O insurance, the costs of\nlitigation including amounts we would pay to indemnify our officers and directors should they be subject to legal action based\non their service to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nFurther, if we are unable to obtain adequate D&O insurance in the future for any reason, we may have difficultly retaining\nand attracting talented and skilled directors and officers, which could adversely affect our business, and may be unable to list\nour Common Shares on a national exchange in the United States, which could impact the liquidity and value of our stock.\nOur insurance policies may be inadequate to fully protect us from material judgments and expenses.\nWe require insurance coverage for a number of risks, including business interruption, environmental matters and\ncontamination, personal injury and property damage as well as general aviation liability coverage. Although we maintain\ninsurance policies, we cannot provide assurance that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments\nand expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical\n37 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nprices or at all. A successful product liability claim could result in substantial cost to us. If insurance coverage is unavailable\nor insufficient to cover any such claims, our financial resources, results of operations and prospects could be adversely\naffected.\nEven if we are fully insured as it relates to a claim, the claim could nevertheless diminish our brand and divert management’s\nattention and resources, which could have a negative impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nRisks Relating to the Ownership of our Securities\nAn investment in our securities involves significant risks.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our\nbusiness and operations and cause the trading price of our securities to decline. If any of the following or other risks occur,\nour business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted. In\nthat event, the trading price of our securities could decline and security holders could lose all or part of their investment.\nThere is no assurance that risk management steps taken will avoid future loss due to the occurrence of the risks described\nbelow or other unforeseen risks.\nOur Common Shares may experience extreme stock price volatility unrelated to our actual or expected operating\nperformance, financial condition or prospects, making it difficult for prospective investors to assess the rapidly changing\nvalue of our Common Shares.\nRecently, there have been instances of extreme stock price run-ups followed by rapid price declines and strong stock price\nvolatility with a number of recent initial public offerings, especially among companies with relatively smaller public floats.\nAs a relatively small-capitalization company with relatively small public float, we may experience greater stock price\nvolatility, extreme price run-ups, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies. In particular,\nour Common Shares may be subject to rapid and substantial price volatility, low volumes of trades and large spreads in bid\nand ask prices. Such volatility, including any stock-run up, may be unrelated to our actual or expected operating performance,\nfinancial condition or prospects, making it difficult for prospective investors to assess the rapidly changing value of our\nCommon Shares.\nIn addition, if the trading volumes of our Common Shares are low, persons buying or selling in relatively small quantities\nmay easily influence prices of our Common Shares. This low volume of trades could also cause the price of our Common\nShares to fluctuate greatly, with large percentage changes in price occurring in any trading day session. Holders of our\nCommon Shares may also not be able to readily liquidate their investment or may be forced to sell at depressed prices due to\nlow volume trading. If high spreads between the bid and ask prices of our Common Shares exist at the time of a purchase,\nthe stock would have to appreciate substantially on a relative percentage basis for an investor to recoup their investment.\nBroad market fluctuations and general economic and political conditions may also adversely affect the market price of our\nCommon Shares.\nAs a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our Common Shares. A volatile market\nprice of our Common Shares also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional shares of Common Shares or other\nsecurities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe market price of our securities may be volatile.\nThe market price for our securities may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly\nresults of operations; (ii) recommendations by securities research analysts; (iii) changes in the economic performance or\nmarket valuations of other issuers that investors deem comparable to us; (iv) departure of executive officers or other key\npersonnel; (v) issuances or anticipated issuances of additional Common Shares; (vi) significant acquisitions or business\ncombinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors; and (vii)\n38 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns, technological or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related\nissues in our industry or target markets.\nFinancial markets have historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the\nmarket prices of equity securities of public entities and that have, in many cases, been unrelated to the operating performance,\nunderlying asset values or prospects of such entities. Accordingly, the market price of our securities may decline even if our\noperating results, underlying asset values or prospects have not changed. Additionally, these factors, as well as other related\nfactors, may cause decreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary, which may result in impairment\nlosses. There can be no assurance that continuing fluctuations in price and volume will not occur. If such increased levels of\nvolatility and market turmoil continue for a protracted period of time, the trading price of the Common Shares may be\nmaterially adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurance of active market for the Common Shares.\nThe Common Shares are listed on the TSXV since September 22, 2020, on the Nasdaq since December 7, 2022, and on the\nFrankfurt Stock Exchange since March 29, 2022. There can be no assurance an active and liquid market for the Common\nShares or Warrants will be maintained. The Warrants to be sold in this offering are not listed on an exchange or marketplace.\nApproximately 0.2 million or 2% of the outstanding Common Shares as of December 22, 2022, subject to regulatory escrow\nimposed by the TSXV in connection with the Amalgamation in Fiscal 2020. These escrow and restrictions will gradually be\nlifted over a period ending on September 18, 2024.\nIf an active public market is not maintained, our shareholders may have difficulty selling the Common Shares or Warrants.\nOur Nasdaq-listed Warrants are speculative in nature.\nThe Nasdaq-listed Warrants do not confer any rights of Common Share ownership on their respective holders, such as voting\nrights or the right to receive dividends, but rather merely represent the right to acquire Common Shares at a fixed price.\nCommencing on the date of issuance, holders of the Warrants may exercise their right to acquire the Common Shares and\npay the stated exercise price per share prior to five years from the date of issuance, after which date any unexercised Warrants\nwill expire and have no further value. Commencing on the date of issuance, holders of the Pre-funded Warrants may exercise\ntheir right to acquire the Common Shares and pay the stated exercise price per share until exercised in full. There can be no\nassurance that the market price of our Common Shares will ever equal or exceed the exercise price of the Warrants offered\nby this prospectus, and if so, the Warrants would expire without value.\nIn the event that our Common Share price does not exceed the exercise price of our Nasdaq-listed Warrants during the\nperiod when the Nasdaq-listed Warrants are exercisable, such warrants may not have any value.\nUntil holders of our Nasdaq-listed Warrants acquire Common Shares upon exercise thereof, holders of such Warrants will\nhave no rights with respect to our Common Shares.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley or our internal controls over financial reporting are not\neffective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned.\nAs a result of our Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC, we are subject to the requirements of Sarbanes-\nOxley. Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley (“Section 404”) requires companies subject to the reporting requirements of United\nStates securities laws to complete a comprehensive evaluation of their internal controls over financial reporting. To comply\nwith this statute, we will be required to document and test our internal control procedures and our management will be\nrequired to assess and issue a report concerning our internal controls over financial reporting. Pursuant to the Jumpstart Our\nBusiness Startups Act of 2012, as amended, we will be classified as an “emerging growth company.” Under the JOBS Act,\nemerging growth companies are exempt from certain reporting requirements, including the independent auditor attestation\n39 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nrequirements of Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley. Under this exemption, our independent auditor will not be required to\nattest to and report on management’s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting during a five year transition\nperiod, except in the event this is accelerated if we lose our status as an “emerging growth company”. We will need to prepare\nfor compliance with Section 404 by strengthening, assessing and testing our system of internal controls to provide the basis\nfor our report. However, the continuous process of strengthening our internal controls and complying with Section 404 is\ncomplicated and time-consuming. Furthermore, we believe that our business will grow both domestically and internationally,\norganically and through acquisitions, in which case our internal controls will become more complex and will require\nsignificantly more resources and attention to ensure our internal controls remain effective overall. During the course of our\ntesting, management may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, which may not be remedied in a timely\nmanner to meet the deadline imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley. If management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our\ninternal controls over financial reporting, or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies material weaknesses\nin our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and the market price of our securities may\nsuffer.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur status as an “emerging growth company.”\nWe are an “emerging growth company” as defined in section 3(a) of the Exchange Act (as amended by the JOBS Act), and\nwill continue to qualify as an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (a) the last day of the fiscal year during\nwhich we have total annual gross revenues of USD$1.235 billion (as such amount is indexed for inflation every five years by\nthe SEC) or more; (b) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common\nequity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (c) the date on which we have, during\nthe previous three-year period, issued more than USD$1 billion in non-convertible debt; and (d) the date on which we are\ndeemed to be a “large accelerated filer”, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. We will qualify as a large\naccelerated filer (and would cease to be an emerging growth company) at such time when on the last business day of our\nsecond fiscal quarter of such year the aggregate worldwide market value of our common equity held by non-affiliates is\nUSD$700 million or more.\nFor so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely upon exemptions from certain\ndisclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These\nexemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404. We cannot predict\nwhether investors will find our securities less attractive because we rely upon certain of these exemptions. If some investors\nfind the securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the price of our\nsecurities may be more volatile. On the other hand, if we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we would be\nrequired to divert additional management time and attention from development and other business activities and incur\nincreased legal and financial costs to comply with the additional associated reporting requirements, which could negatively\nimpact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may lose foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional costs and expenses.\nWe are a “foreign private issuer”, under applicable United States federal securities laws, and are, therefore, not subject to the\nsame requirements that are imposed upon United States domestic issuers by the SEC. Under the Exchange Act, we are subject\nto reporting obligations that, in certain respects, are less detailed and less frequent than those of United States domestic\nreporting companies. As a result, we do not file the same reports that a United States domestic issuer would file with the SEC,\nalthough we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC the continuous disclosure documents that we are required to file\nin Canada under Canadian securities laws. In addition, our officers, directors, and principal shareholders are exempt from the\nreporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Therefore, our shareholders may not\nknow on as timely a basis when our officers, directors and principal shareholders purchase or sell Common Shares, as the\nreporting periods under the corresponding Canadian insider reporting requirements are longer.\n40 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\nAs a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act related to the furnishing\nand content of proxy statements. We are also exempt from Regulation FD, which prohibits issuers from making selective\ndisclosures of material non-public information. While we comply with the corresponding requirements relating to proxy\nstatements and disclosure of material non-public information under Canadian securities laws, these requirements differ from\nthose under the Exchange Act and Regulation FD and shareholders should not expect to receive the same information at the\nsame time as such information is provided by United States domestic companies. In addition, we may not be required under\nthe Exchange Act to file annual and quarterly reports with the SEC as promptly as U.S. domestic companies whose securities\nare registered under the Exchange Act.\nIn order to maintain our status as a foreign private issuer, a majority of the Common Shares must be either directly or indirectly\nowned by non-residents of the United States unless we satisfy one of the additional requirements necessary to preserve this\nstatus. We may in the future lose our foreign private issuer status if a majority of our Common Shares are held in the United\nStates and if we fail to meet the additional requirements necessary to avoid loss of our foreign private issuer status. The\nregulatory and compliance costs under United States federal securities laws as a United States domestic issuer may be\nsignificantly more than the costs incurred as a Canadian foreign private issuer using the standard foreign form. If we are not\na foreign private issuer, we would not be eligible to use the foreign issuer forms and would be required to file periodic and\ncurrent reports and registration statements on United States domestic issuer forms with the SEC, which are more detailed and\nextensive than the forms available to a foreign private issuer.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements Nasdaq could result in a delisting of our securities.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as minimum bid price requirements, Nasdaq may take\nsteps to delist our Common Shares. Such a delisting would have a negative effect on the price of our Common Shares, impair\nthe ability to sell or purchase our Common Shares when persons wish to do so, and any delisting materially adversely affect\nour ability to raise capital or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions on acceptable terms, or at all.\nDelisting from Nasdaq could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of institutional investor interest and\nfewer business development opportunities, as well as a limited amount of news and analyst coverage of us. In the event of a\ndelisting, we would attempt to take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements, but we can provide\nno assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our securities to become listed again, stabilize the market price or\nimprove the liquidity of our securities, prevent our Common Shares from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price\nrequirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements.\n41 | P age"

There was no change to the reported net loss per share (basic and diluted).\nPlease refer to Note 21 of the Amended and Restated Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for\nthe quarter ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 for additional information.\nIn connection with the filing of the above amended and restated interim financials, the Company is also filing (i)\namended and restated management discussion and analysis in compliance with the requirements of National\nInstrument 51-102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations, and (ii) CEO and CFO certifications in compliance with\nNational Instrument 51-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings.\n2 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nAMENDED AND RESTATED MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nQUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020\nAll references in this amended and restated management’s discussion and analysis (the “MD&A’’) to “KWESST’’,\n“we’’, “us’’, “our’’, and the “Company’’ refer to KWESST Micro Systems Inc. and its subsidiary as at December 31,\n2020.\nThis MD&A is intended to provide readers with the information that management believes is required to gain an\nunderstanding of the current results of KWESST and to assess the Company’s future prospects. Accordingly,\ncertain sections of this MD&A contain forward-looking statements that are based on current plans and\nexpectations. These forward-looking statements are affected by risks and uncertainties that are discussed in this\nMD&A and that could have a material impact on future prospects (see Forward-Looking Statements below).\nReaders are cautioned that actual events and results will vary.\nThe MD&A was approved by the Board of Directors on April 15, 2021 and should be in conjunction with the\nunaudited amended and restated consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended December\n31, 2020 (“Q1 Fiscal 2021’’) and the annual audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the\nperiod ended September 30, 2020 (“Fiscal 2020’’). The financial information presented in this MD&A is derived\nfrom these unaudited amended and restated consolidated interim financial statements prepared in accordance\nwith International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS’’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards\nBoard (“IASB’’).\nAll references to $ or dollar amounts in this MD&A are to Canadian currency unless otherwise indicated.\nAdditional information, including press releases, relating to KWESST is available for view on SEDAR at\nwww.sedar.com.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nThis MD&A makes reference to certain non-IFRS measures such as “EBITDA’’ and “Adjusted EBITDA”. These\nnon-IFRS measures are not recognized, defined or standardized measures under IFRS. Our definitions for these\nnon-IFRS measures will likely differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for or in isolation form measures prepared\nin accordance with IFRS. These non-IFRS measures should be read in conjunction with the unaudited\nconsolidated interim financial statements and the related notes thereto as at and for the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2020 (herein referred as Q1 Fiscal 2021 FS). Readers should not place undue reliance on non-\nIFRS measures and should instead view them in conjunction with the most comparable IFRS financial measures.\nSee the reconciliations to these IFRS measures in the “Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures’’ section of this\nMD&A.\nGOING CONCERN\nAs an early-stage company, KWESST has incurred significant losses and negative operating cash flows from\ninception that have primarily been funded from financing activities. KWESST’s Q1 2021 FS have been prepared\non the “going concern’’ basis which presumes that KWESST will be able to realize its assets and discharge its\nliabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. While KWESST had $1.4 million of working\ncapital at December 31, 2020 and subsequently raised additional capital via exercised options and warrants as\nwell as additional borrowings, the Company is in the process of raising additional capital to fund its business\ngrowth strategies over the next 12 months (see Overview – Subsequent Events section of this MD&A).

Its registered office is located at 550 Burrard St., Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia,\nV6C 0A3, with its corporate office located at 155 Terence Matthews Crescent, Unit #1, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada,\nK2M 2A8.\nKWESST’s common stock is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (“TSX-V”) under the stock symbol of KWE. On\nFebruary 3, 2021, KWESST announced that its common shares have been approved for listing on the OTCQB ®\nVenture Market (\"OTCQB ®\"), a US trading platform that is operated by the OTC Markets Group in New York. On\nFebruary 4, 2021, KWESST commenced trading on the OTCQB ® under the symbol KWEMF.\nKWESST’s Core Business and Strategy\nKWESST’s mission is to be a leader in advancing the modern networked capability of soldiers and responders,\nincluding the networked Soldier Systems mission of NATO and its allies, with niche application that make a critical\ndifference to safety and effective.\nKWESST develops and markets proprietary technology for applications in the military and homeland security\nmarket. KWESST’s core technology has multiple applications based on Micro Integrated Systems and Software\nTechnology (“MISST”), a proprietary integration of miniaturized sensors, optics, ballistics and software that\nprovides an advancement in affordable smart systems and mission capability. Current applications and offerings\nenable: (i) real-time networked situational awareness for soldiers and their weapons systems; (ii) smart\nmanagement of ordinance systems; (iii) solutions for countering drone attacks and countermeasures against\nweaponized lasers.\nThe Company’s primary markets are the U.S. and other NATO and NATO partner countries, many of whom have\nincreased their military budgets.\nWhile KWESST is an early-stage company, during Fiscal 2020 we achieved revenue growth of 126% annualized\nover the prior year and continued to generate revenues in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, in part due to significant\nprogress in gaining acceptance from a major U.S. military customer for its TASCS IFM system (Tactical\nAwareness and Situational Control System - Integrated Fires Modules). Following successful trials in Virginia\nheld in September 2020 and in California in November 2020 for KWESST’s TASCS IFM system on the 81mm\nmortar platform, the customer awarded a follow-on order of US$800,000 or approximately $1.1 million to expand\nthe use of our TASCS IFM system in military exercises at two battalions. This is generally a precursor to wider\nadoption and formal customer acceptance.\nFor more details on KWESST products and markets, refer to the amended Annual Information Form dated April\n15, 2021. This document and other information about KWESST are available on SEDAR under the Company’s\nprofile at www.sedar.com.\nCOVID-19 Impact to Operations\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has caused material changes to the global economic, political, and consumer\nlandscape, we have been able to adapt quickly and remain focused on delivering on our key milestones during\nFiscal 2020, including successful trials of our TASCS IFM and the completion of the QT. To date, we have been\nable to operate at full capacity with no shutdown. That being said, KWESST is not immune by the impact of a\nprolonged COVID-19, including lockdowns, as it may impede our ability to do international travel for certain field\ntrials, deployments, testing, data gathering, business development and sales activities due to government-\n5 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nAMENDED AND RESTATED MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nQUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020\nimposed travel restrictions and the health risks that traveling during a time of significant uncertainty and risk would\nentail. Consequently, this may adversely affect our revenue and cash flows outlook for Fiscal 2021. To reduce\nthis business risk, we have opened a U.S. office in January 2021 to accelerate our pursuit for U.S. military\nopportunities.\nSubsequent Events\nIn addition to the Board approval of the LEC Technology acquisition (see Acquisitions section of this MD&A), the\nCompany had the following material events since December 31, 2020:\nAmended and Restated Licensing Agreement\nOn April 5, 2021, KWESST entered into an amended and restated licensing agreement with AerialX to gain\nexclusive rights to the Licensed Technology for the United States Department of Defense and Canada’s\nDepartment of National Defence from the date upon which AerialX will meet certain technical milestones. In\nconsideration for the exclusivity, upon signing the agreement, KWESST will issue 100,000 common shares to\nAerialX. KWESST also agreed to issue an additional 100,000 common shares upon AerialX achieving the\ntechnical milestones.\nKWESST will continue to have non-exclusive worldwide license.\nIn addition to the above share consideration, KWESST also agreed to issue up to 300,000 common shares subject\nto achieving the following financial milestones:\n# of Common Shares Milestones\n75,000 $3 million in sales\n100,000 $9 million in sales\n125,000 $18 million in sales\nThe amended and restated licensing agreement will expire on April 30, 2026.\nThe above is in addition to the current 8% royalty on annual sales subject to the following minimum annual\nroyalties as per previous licensing agreement:\nYear (1) Minimum Annual Royalties\nYear 1 $150,000\nYear 2 $200,000\nYear 3 $300,000\nYear 4 $400,000\nYear 5 $500,000\n(1) From the Prototype Date (2nd milestone above)\nKWESST has already prepaid $150,000 as advanced royalties to be applied against future royalty payments.\nFinancing\nOn April 6, 2021, KWESST has entered into an agreement with PI Financial Corp., as lead agent and sole\nbookrunner (the \"Lead Agent\"), on its own behalf and, if applicable, on behalf of a syndicate of agents (together\nwith the Lead Agent, the \"Agents\") in connection with a best efforts, private placement of up to 2,000,000 units of\nthe Company (the \"Units\") at a price of $1.25 per Unit (the \"Offering Price\") for gross proceeds of up\n6 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nAMENDED AND RESTATED MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nQUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020\nto $2,500,000 (the \"Offering\"). On April 9, 2021, KWESST announced the Offering was upsized up to a total of\n3,200,000 Units for total gross proceeds of $4,000,000.\nEach Unit will be comprised of one common share of KWESST (a \"Common Share\") and one Common Share\npurchase warrant (\"Warrant\"). Each Warrant will be exercisable to acquire one Common Share (a \"Warrant\nShare\") at a price of $1.75 per Warrant Share for a period of 24 months from the closing of the Offering. If at any\ntime after four (4) months and one (1) day following the Closing Date, the trading price of the Shares on the TSX\nVenture Exchange is equal to or exceeds $3 for a period of 10 consecutive trading days, as evidenced by the\nprice at the close of market, the Company will be entitled to notify the holders of Warrants of its intention to force\nthe exercise of the Warrants. Upon receipt of such notice, the holders of Warrants will have 30 days to exercise\nthe Warrants, failing which the Warrants will automatically expire.\nKWESST will pay the Agents a commission of 7% of the gross proceeds of the Offering (3.5% for Units issued to\nsubscribers on the Presidential list). Additionally, KWESST will issue compensation options of 7% of the total\nUnits (excluding subscribers on the Presidential list). Each option may be exercised at $1.25 to purchase one\nUnit and will expire in two years.\nThe use of proceeds will be primarily to: (i) finance working capital; (ii) close the previously announced LEC\ntechnology acquisition; (iii) begin the commercialization of this LEC product; (iv) accelerate productization of the\nGreyGhost micro-drone missile; (v) ramp up the Company’s ATAK Centre of Excellence (refer to the Company’s\nannouncement on March 30, 2021); and (vi) accelerate productization of the Phantom electronic decoy.\nOrganizational\nOn January 15, 2021, KWESST announced that Canadian General (Retired) Rick Hillier will lead its new\nInternational Advisory Council, which will provide guidance to KWESST on its strategic build-out on a global scale.\nGeneral Hillier served as Canada's Chief of Defence Staff (\"CDS\") CDS from February 4, 2005, to July 1, 2008.\nOn February 24, 2021, Ms. Elisabeth Preston joined the Company as a member of the board of directors and\nCorporate Secretary. Ms. Preston is the Chief Legal Counsel for a top tier international defence company with\nwidespread global operations.\nOn April 12, 2021, KWESST announced the appointment of Mr. Rick Bowes as Chief Operating Officer. Mr.\nBowes held various senior roles with defence contractors such as General Dynamics Canada, DRS Technologies\nCanada (now Leonardo DRS), ATCO Frontec and ADGA Group Inc., and he had a distinguished career as a\nsenior officer in the Canadian Army, retiring in 2003 as a Lieutenant Colonel.\nOutlook\nWith the $1.1 million U.S. military contract awarded in December 2020, we are on track to meet key milestones\nincluding current live-fire exercises at a U.S. military base in April 2021. We have already begun collecting on this\ncontract for services rendered.\nFurther, on February 19, 2021, the TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) approved the LEC Technology acquisition\n(see next section) and consented KWESST to close the transaction. We expect to close this acquisition\nconcurrently with the $4.0 million brokered private placement (see above).\n7 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nAMENDED AND RESTATED MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nQUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020\nACQUISITIONS\nTo accelerate our growth plans and respond to market opportunities, we have made the following technology\nacquisition.\nLEC Technology\nOn June 6, 2020, we entered into a binding letter of agreement with DEFSEC to acquire the proprietary non-lethal\nmunitions technology system referred to as Low Energy Cartridge technology (“LEC Technology’’) from DEFSEC.\nThe acquisition includes all IP rights for the LEC Technology.\nIn January 2021, KWESST’s Board of Directors approved this transaction, subject to TSX Venture Exchange\n(TSX-V) approval. As previously noted, the TSX-V has consented of this technology acquisition in February 2021.\nThe LEC Technology is a proprietary non-lethal cartridge-based ordnance system to address four market\nsegments that currently use a variety of dated “non-lethal’’ or “less-lethal’’ products, each having a vast global\nmarket. The four market segments as follows:\ni) Public order (riots and control of dangerous subjects);\nii) Military and law enforcement training (realistic force-on-force training);\niii) Personal defence (home, car, boat, RB, camping, hiking); and\niv) High-action gaming.\nWith recent events of riots / widespread protests in the U.S. leading to fatalities, we believe this LEC Technology\nwill position us well to address this potentially large market demand for non-lethal weapons.\nThe purchase consideration for the LEC Technology is 1 million common shares of KWESST and 500,000 share\npurchase warrants of KWESST at $0.70 each, as previously agreed on June 6, 2020. The warrants are subject\nto vesting with 25% on the first anniversary of the closing of the LEC Technology acquisition and 25% on each of\nthe subsequent three anniversaries. Additionally, at closing of the acquisition, KWESST will pay $150,000 as an\nadvance on future royalties. Under the technology purchase agreement, KWESST will pay 7% royalty on annual\nsales of the LEC Technology, net of taxes, duties, customs brokerage fees, shipping and handling costs, customer\ncredits, discounts and returns, up to a maximum of $10 million (“Maximum Royalties’’). Starting on the second\nanniversary of the LEC closing date, for each year until the Maximum Royalties have been paid, KWESST agreed\nto pay the following annual minimum royalty payments:\na) 2nd anniversary: $150,000;\nb) 3rd anniversary: $150,000;\nc) 4th anniversary: $200,000;\nd) 5th anniversary: $200,000;\ne) 6th anniversary: $250,000;\nf) 7th anniversary: $250,000;\ng) 8th anniversary: $300,000;\nh) 9th anniversary: $300,000;\ni) 10th anniversary: $350,000; and\nj) 11th anniversary: $350,000\nThis acquisition constitutes as a related party transaction because DEFSEC is a private company owned by David\nLuxton, our Executive Chairman. Mr. Luxton recused himself from the Board deliberations and approval of this\nacquisition.\n8 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nAMENDED AND RESTATED MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nQUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following selected financial data has been extracted from Q1 Fiscal 2021 FS.\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nRevenue $ 146,349 $ 3,741\nCost of sales 71,564 7,887\nGross profit 74,785 (4,146)\nGross margin % 51.1% NM\nOperating expenses 1,502,311 713,972\nOperating loss (1,427,526) (718,118)\nForeign exchange loss (3,385) (41,617)\nGain on derivatives - 113,178\nNet finance costs (17,948) (52,231)\nNet loss $ ( 1,448,859) $ ( 698,788)\n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ ( 1,192,607) $ ( 693,633)\nEarnings (loss) per share - basic and diluted $ (0.04) $ (0.03)\nWeighted average common shares - basic 41,392,149 20,767,543\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, KWESST incurred\na non-cash compensation charge of $175,893, which also contributed to the increase in total Corporate expenses.\nRefer to Note 13 of Q1 Fiscal 2021 for further information.\nGain on Derivatives\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2019, KWESST recognized a gain on derivatives of $113,178 as a result\nof certain convertible debt converted to common shares.\n12 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nAMENDED AND RESTATED MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nQUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020\nNet Finance Costs\nTotal finance costs for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 were $17,948, a 66% reduction over the comparable\nprior period. This reduction is primarily due to the conversion of all convertible notes to KWESST common shares\nupon the closing of the Qualifying Transaction which occurred in September 2020.\nNet Loss and Adjusted EBITDA Loss\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2020, KWESST incurred a net loss of $1,448,859 or $0.04 loss per basic\nshare, compared to net loss of $698,788 or $0.03 loss per basic share for the same period in 2019.\nThese results include foreign exchange loss, non-cash and non-recurring items and accordingly we have also\npresented Adjusted EBITDA loss in this MD&A in order to help readers better understand our operating results.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA loss was $1,192,607 compared to Adjusted EBITDA\nloss of $693,633 for the same period in 2019.\nKey Balance Sheet Items\nThe following table summarizes our financial position:\nDecember 31, September 30,\n2020 2020\nAssets\nCurrent $ 2 ,773,498 $ 3 ,994,888\nNon-current 1 ,803,416 1 ,512,123\nTotal assets $ 4 ,576,914 $ 5 ,507,011\nLiabilities\nCurrent $ 1 ,223,571 $ 1 ,154,234\nNon-current 4 89,539 4 96,394\nTotal liabilities $ 1 ,713,110 $ 1 ,650,628\nNet book value $ 2 ,863,804 $ 3 ,856,383\nChanges since September 30, 2020:\nCurrent assets decreased by $1.2 million due mainly to working capital used to fund its operations (see Liquidity\nand Capital Resources section of this MD&A).\nNon-current assets increased by $0.3 million mainly due to capitalization of development costs in which the\nCompany expects to recover from the U.S. military contract awarded in December 2020.\nThere were no significant changes to total liabilities since September 30, 2020.\n13 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nAMENDED AND RESTATED MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nQUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020\nThe following table shows a summary of the rights-of-use assets and related obligations as reported in the Q1\nFiscal 2021 FS:\nDecember 31, September 30,\n2020 2020\nRight-of-use assets $ 4 95,479 $ 5 20,440\nLease obligations:\nCurrent 8 7,325 7 8,358\nNon-current 4 89,539 4 96,394\nLease obligations $ 5 76,864 $ 5 74,752\nThe right-of-use assets excludes the lease deposit to be returned at the end of the lease.

Since\nKWESST’s incorporation in late 2017, we have devoted significant energy to developing our proprietary TASCS\nsystem, our signature app and snap-on weapon adaptor that enables real-time streaming of situational awareness\ndata of any kind from any source, including drones, direct to smart devices and operational assets, for a common\noperating picture and networked engagement. During 2018 and 2019, we also invested significant time in doing\ndemonstrations of our early prototypes to U.S. customers which led to entering into two teaming agreements with\nAeroVironment Inc. and ManTech International Corporation. These agreements led to more meaningful revenues\nin the second half of 2019 and the last two quarters of Fiscal 2020.\nThe general trend of increased quarterly operating expenses reflects the investments being made to grow our\nbusiness (an increase headcount and facility costs). In the last two quarters of Fiscal 2020, operating costs\nincreased primarily as a result of higher professional fees incurred for patents and trademarks, share-based\ncompensation, investor relations costs and going public related costs.\nOver the next 12 months, management expects continued volatility in KWESST’s quarterly revenue, operating\nresults, and cash flows for the foreseeable future as KWESST continues to invest in promoting KWESST and its\nproduct offerings, product development and bringing products to market during Fiscal 2021.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe have financed our operations to date through the issuance of common shares. To fund KWESST business\ngrowth, we may need to raise additional capital through various means including the issuance of equity and/or\ndebt during Fiscal 2021 (see Overview – Subsequent Events section of this MD&A).\nOur approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we always have sufficient liquidity to\nmeet our liabilities as they come due. We do so by continuously monitoring cash flow and actual operating\nexpenses.\nKWESST’s cash position decreased to $1.7 million at December 31, 2020, from $3.1 million at September 30,\n2020, primarily due to the net operating loss incurred during Q1 Fiscal 2021.\n15 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nAMENDED AND RESTATED MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nQUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020\nOur principal cash requirements are for working capital and R&D investments. KWESST’s working capital as at\nDecember 31, 2020 was approximately $1.6 million, a reduction of $1.3 million since September 30, 2020.\nThe following table provides a summary of cash inflows and outflows by activity:\nQuarter ended Quarter ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2020 2019\nCash inflow (outflow) by activity:\nOperating activities $ ( 1,229,875) $ ( 759,321)\nInvesting activities (329,316) (160,691)\nFinancing acitivities 186,795 938,234\nNet cash inflows $ ( 1,372,397) $ 1 8,222\nCash used by operating activities\nAs an early-stage company, we continued to invest significantly across the Company’s organization. Despite the\nrevenue growth over the prior year, it was not sufficient to cover our overhead costs, professional fees, advertising\nand promotion costs, and R&D costs. Accordingly, this resulted in negative operating cash flows of $1.3 million\nfor Q1 Fiscal 2021, compared to negative $0.8 million for Q1 Fiscal 2020.\nCash used by investing activities\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2020, KWESST continued to invest in development projects in which\nrecoverability is anticipated from the $1.1 million U.S. military contract awarded in December 2020. This\ncontributed mainly to the negative investing activities for the quarter. In the comparable prior period, KWESST\nmade a $150,000 advanced royalty payment to AerialX.\nCash provided by financing activities\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we raised $195,957 through exercised of stock options. In the\ncomparable prior period, KWESST raised approximately $1.0 million through issuance of common shares in a\nnon-brokered private placement.\nContractual Commitments and Obligations\nThe Company’s remaining operating lease commitments are for office premises, which will expire in March 2026.\nFurther, KWESST has committed to minimum annual royalty payments to AerialX for its licensed drone (see Note\n18 of Q1 Fiscal 2021 FS) and upon closing the LEC Technology acquisition it will be subject to further minimum\nannual royalty payments starting from the 2nd anniversary from closing date (see Acquisition section of this MD&A).\n16 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nAMENDED AND RESTATED MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nQUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020\nAt December 31, 2020, KWESST’s contractual obligations and commitments were as follows:\nPayment due: Total Within 1 Year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years\nMinimum royalty commitments $ 1,550,000 $ 150,000 $ 5 00,000 $ 900,000\nLease obligations 751,992 127,830 254,805 369,357\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 884,105 884,105 - -\nBorrowings 60,000 - 60,000 -\nTotal with third parties 3,246,097 1,161,935 814,805 1,269,357\nRelated party loans 199,094 199,094 - -\nTotal contractual obligations $ 3,445,191 $ 1 ,361,029 $ 8 14,805 $ 1 ,269,357\nThe above table does not include the minimum annual royalty payments that will be due to DEFSEC once the\nasset acquisition is closed. Upon closing and in accordance with the purchase agreement, KWESST will make\nan advanced royalty payment of $150,000 to DEFSEC.\nFurther, since December 31, 2020, we have increased our borrowings by $306,000 as a result of entering into an\nunsecured demand loan agreement with a private fund managed by a KWESST’s shareholder for general\ncorporate purposes. This unsecured loan agreement is due the earlier of a change of control (as defined in the\nagreement) and May 25, 2021 and bears interest at a rate of 0.5% per month.\nManagement has estimated the Company’s normalized monthly cash burn rate to be approximately $260,000 or\n$3.1 million per annum; however, more recently the monthly burn rate has been above this level primarily due to\nan increased investment in advertising and promotion to raise market awareness on the Company’s profile and\nits product offerings. The Company anticipates this trend will continue into the next quarter.\nAs a result of the available working capital at December 31, 2020, subsequent capital raise (see below\nOutstanding Share Information) and the anticipated collection from the $1.1 million follow-on sales order awarded\nin December 2020, management believes the Company has significant capital to finance its working capital\nrequirements for the near term. Additionally, as previously noted, KWESST launched a $4 million brokered private\nplacement to raise additional capital to meet all the contractual commitments and obligations and to accelerate its\ngo-to-market initiatives for KWESST’s product offerings. There is no assurance that KWESST will close this\nbrokered private placement.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect\non our results of operations, financial condition, revenues or expenses, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital\nresources.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nRefer to Note 10 of Q1 Fiscal 2021 FS for comprehensive disclosure about KWESST’s related party transactions\nconducted in the normal course of business. In summary, the related party transactions that occurred during the\nquarter ended December 31, 2020 were:\n• $11,252 repayment of employee loan, including $68 of accrued interest;\n• $10,000 partial repayment of CEO loan and accrued interest of $2,002, leaving $199,094 outstanding\nDecember 31, 2020; and\n17 | P ag e\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nAMENDED AND RESTATED MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nQUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020\n• $35,615 compensation (cash and share-based) to a consulting firm for providing capital markets advisory\nservices (a significant shareholder of KWESST).\nThe above transactions were market based. At December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding amount in\naccounts payable and accrued liabilities due to officers and directors of KWESST.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS\nWe recognize financial assets and liabilities when we become party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\nOn initial recognition, financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly\nattributable to the financial assets and liabilities, except for financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit\nand loss, whereby the transactions costs are expensed as incurred.\nRefer to Note 16 of the Q1 Fiscal 2021 FS for comprehensive disclosure on KWESST’s financial instruments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nRefer to Note 2(f) of the Fiscal 2020 audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting\npolicies and estimates that are critical to the understanding of our business operations and the results of our\noperations.\nOUTSTANDING SHARE INFORMATION\nAt December 31, 2020, KWESST’s authorized capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares with no\nstated par value.\nThe following table shows the changes in common shares, options, and warrants since December 31, 2020 to the\ndate of this MD&A:\nDecember 31, April 15,\n2020 Exercised Granted Other Issued 2021\nCommon shares 41,942,258 - - (270) 585,399 42,527,387\nWarrants 9,335,050 ( 173,899) - - 9,161,151\nStock options 2,484,358 ( 411,500) 1,152,500 - 3 ,225,358\nTotal securities 53,761,666 ( 585,399) 1,152,500 ( 270) 585,399 54,913,896\nThe common share issuances relate to exercised warrants and stock options.

Its registered office is located at 550 Burrard St., Suite 2900, Vancouver, British Columbia,\nV6C 0A3, with its corporate office located at 155 Terence Matthews Crescent, Unit #1, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada,\nK2M 2A8.\nKWESST’s common stock is listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (“TSX-V”) under the stock symbol of KWE and\non the OTCQB ® Venture Market (\"OTCQB ®\"), a US trading platform that is operated by the OTC Markets Group\nin New York, under the symbol KWEMF.\nKWESST’s Core Business and Strategy\nKWESST develops and commercializes next-generation tactical systems that meet the requirements of security\nforces and personal defense for overmatch capability against adversaries. Key market segments and solutions\naddressed by KWESST technologies are: (i) breakthrough technology in non-lethal systems with broad\napplication, including law enforcement and personal defence, (ii) modernized digitization of tactical forces for\nshared situational awareness and targeting, and (iii) counter-measures against threats such as drones, lasers and\nelectronic detection. KWESST’s primary markets are the U.S. and other NATO and NATO partner countries.\nFor more details on KWESST products and markets, refer to the AIF. This document and other information about\nKWESST are available on SEDAR under the Company’s profile at www.sedar.com.\nBusiness Highlights for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2021\nThe following is a summary of the key business highlights for KWESST for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2021.\nBusiness and product development\nLow-Energy Cartridge System (“LEC System”)\nOn April 29, 2021, KWESST expanded and diversified its business with the acquisition of the Low Energy\nCartridge technology system (“LEC System’’) from DEFSEC (see Acquisition section of this MD&A). Based on\nmanagement’s knowledge, the LEC System is the world’s first cartridge based non-lethal firing system with\nuniversal applications. We have made significant progress towards building demonstration samples. On July 9,\n2021, KWESST completed its first public live demonstration of the LEC System to a group of investors in the\nWhistler, British Columbia area.\nFurther in July 2021, we announced that Brandon Tatum agreed to act as advisor and an advocate of KWESST’s\nLEC System for law enforcement and personal defense in the United States. Mr. Tatum is a former Tucson Police\nOfficer. Today, he runs the YouTube channel called \"The Officer Tatum\" with over 1.6 million subscribers and is\na frequent guest on TV shows such as The Ingraham Angle and Justice with Judge Jeanine on Fox News Channel.\nHe has a regular following of more than three million people across various social media platforms, providing\nKWESST with an excellent opportunity to increase market awareness of its LEC System in the United States.\nThe number of subscribers and followers was provided by Mr. Tatum.\nTASCS IFM\nUnder contract to a key U.S. military customer, in April 2021, we successfully conducted U.S. military exercises\nof TASCS IFM mortar system for the 81mm mortar. These exercises provided KWESST with further insight for\nenhancing the performance of its TASCS IFM mortar system in advance of the second round of U.S. military\n4 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021\nexercises. At the customer’s request, these additional U.S. military exercises haves since been rescheduled from\nJuly 2021 to October 2021. Accordingly, we now expect to complete this contract during the first quarter of FY\n2022.\nSubject to continued success at the U.S. military exercises in October 2021, we expect to win follow-on orders for\nthe U.S. military customer. During the quarter, we also began engaging in discussions regarding this product with\nthe Canadian Department of National Defence and expect to do demonstrations in early October.\nGreyGhost®\nIn April 2021, KWESST entered into an amended and restated licensing agreement with AerialX to gain exclusive\nrights to manufacture, operate, and use its drone for the C-UAS (Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems) market,\nspecifically for the United States Department of Defense and Canada’s Department of National Defence for a\nperiod of two years (the “Exclusivity”) from the date upon which AerialX will meet certain technical milestones (see\n2021 Interim FS – Note 20 for further details on financial terms).\nThe amended and restated licensing agreement also resulted in the postponement of minimum annual royalty\npayments to KWESST until the first anniversary of certain technological milestones being met. Accordingly, the\nminimum annual payments will be as follows:\n• 1st anniversary: $150,000\n• 2nd anniversary: $200,000\n• 3rd anniversary: $300,000\n• 4th anniversary: $400,000\n• 5th anniversary: $500,000\nAt June 30, 2021, the minimum royalties provision was not triggered.\nIn accordance with the original royalty agreement dated November 18, 2019, in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020\nKWESST made a payment of $150,000 as an advance for future royalty payments (the “Advance”). This Advance\nwas recorded as a non-current deposit in the audited consolidated statements of financial position at December\n31, 2019 and September 30, 2020. In accordance with IFRS, during the quarter management performed a\nrecoverability review of all KWESST’s financial assets, including this Advance. Management made the\nrecoverability assessment on the Advance based on anticipated future sales of the licensed technology. While\nKWESST continues to work with AerialX on this project, management has concluded the timing and volume of\nfuture sales of the licensed drone was uncertain at this stage given AerialX has not yet met the technological\nmilestones. Accordingly, KWESST took a full charge to net loss for the Advance in Q3 Fiscal 2021.\nPhantomTM\nIn April 2021, KWESST was awarded its first U.S. patent (No. 10,969,467) for its PhantomTM electronic decoy,\nspecifically for the programmable multi-waveform RF generator for use as battlefield decoy. In conjunction with\nthe patent award, KWEEST’s PhantomTM was selected in defence and innovation programs for evaluation,\nincluding a U.S. Special Operations Command (“USSOCOM”) program. This evaluation took place in June 2021\nat the USSOCOM Technical Experimental event held in Indiana, where we successfully demonstrated the initial\nPhantomTM prototype, fully integrated with ATAK (as defined below).\nATAK\nAs disclosed in Q2 Fiscal 2021, we launched an ATAK Centre of Excellence to facilitate customer requirements\nfor integration into ATAK (Android Tactical Assault Kit), a pre-eminent battlefield management system used by\nmore than a dozen U.S. government agencies and many NATO allies and partner nations.\n5 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021\nWe are currently in active discussions with major parties for ATAK integration services, which we anticipate will\nlead to sales contracts in Fiscal 2022.\nFinancing\nOn April 29, 2021, KWESST closed an over-subscribed brokered private placement for aggregate gross proceeds\nof more than $4.4 million (herein referred as “2021 Financing”), providing the Company with near-term liquidity\nand capital to expand and accelerate its business growth strategies. See Liquidity and Capital Resources section\nof this MD&A for further details on the 2021 Financing and use of funds to June 30, 2021.\nFurther, during the quarter KWESST received notification from Innovation Solutions Canada (“ISC”) that it qualified\nfor up to $1.5 million in project funding in support of the further development and productization of its TACSC IFM\nsystem, PhantomTM electronic decoy system, and counter-drone system. This non-dilutive funding is subject to\nvarious conditions, including securing end-user sponsorship from the Canadian Department of National Defence\nor other agencies. In August 2021, KWESST announced it has successfully secured the required sponsorship\nfor two of the three projects, with the sponsorship for the third one expected in the near term.\nOrganizational\nWith the significant business expansion (LEC acquisition in April 2021 and creation of the ATAK Centre of\nExcellence in March 2021), we have augmented KWESST’s leadership team with the appointment of Rick Bowes\nas Vice President, Operations for Digitization and Tactical Products. Mr. Bowes held various senior roles with\ndefence contractors and had a distinguished career as a senior officer in the Canadian Army, retiring in 2003 as\na Lieutenant Colonel. Further, KWESST’s part-time CFO (Steven Archambault) agreed to join the Company on\na full-time basis effective April 1st.\nAdditionally, in July 2021 we hired Blaine Groves to lead the ongoing productization effort of the LEC System\nstarting in early September 2021. Mr. Groves spent over 17 years in senior positions at Colt Canada including\nmost recently R&D Manager and Product Support Engineering. Colt Canada is the Canadian division of the\nAmerican firearms manufacturer.\nCOVID-19 Impact to Operations\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has caused material changes to the global economic, political, and consumer\nlandscape, there have not been any significant interruptions to our business activities during the latest quarter.\nWe continue to operate at full capacity with no shutdown. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has not hindered\nKWESST’s ability to meet key performance milestones under its contract with a US military customer for the\nTASCS IFM. That said, persistent government-imposed international travel restrictions and lock downs have\nsignificantly curtailed business development activities to promote and conduct sales demonstrations of KWESST’s\nproduct offerings in overseas markets. While KWESST is encouraged by the global roll-out of government-\napproved vaccines, a prolonged government-imposed international travel restriction and/or lock down may impede\nour ability to accelerate our overseas market development plans in the near-term. One notable exception is the\nU.K., where Europe’s premier defence tradeshow, DESI, held in September each year, has been reinstated for\n2021 after a long COVID hiatus.\nTo reduce the above risk, KWESST continues to leverage its US-based business development team to prioritize\nand pursue U.S. military contract opportunities. Further, the recent launch of the ATAK Centre of Excellence\nenables remote delivery of ATAK integration services to anywhere in the world, providing another source of\nexpected revenue in the near term.\n6 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021\nOutlook\nOur near-term priorities are, but not limited to:\n• Commercialize the initial phase of the LEC system for the personal defence and law enforcement markets,\nincluding a soft launch in Q1 of Fiscal 2022 with selected end-user groups and market influencers,\nfollowed by a hard launch at the SHOT Show in Las Vegas, January 18-21, 2022;\n• Finalize upgrades for the TASCS IFM system on the 81mm mortar for additional customer trials and\ndemonstrations scheduled for October 2021;\n• Close on pending ATAK integration service sales opportunities, including with major defence contractors,\nbefore the end of calendar 2021;\n• Complete the development of KWESST’s first generation of the PhantomTM electronic decoy following\npositive feedback from the USSCOM demonstration held in June 2021 for follow-on demonstrations and\ninitial sales opportunities;\n• Accelerate enhancement and productization of the GreyGhost micro-drone missile system, to address\nboth the C-UAS and the emerging counter loitering munitions (C-LM) markets;\n• Complete the announced funding contract negotiation with Innovative Solutions Canada; and\n• Upgrade the Company’s digital marketing tools including video creations of KWESST’s product offerings.\nACQUISITIONS\nTo accelerate KWESST’s growth plans and respond to market opportunities, we have made the following\ntechnology acquisition.\nLEC System\nOn April 29, 2021, KWESST completed the acquisition of LEC System with DEFSEC, a proprietary non-lethal\ncartridge-based firing system. This asset acquisition includes all IP rights for the LEC System.\nThe LEC System is a proprietary non-lethal cartridge-based ordnance system to address four market segments\nthat currently use a variety of dated “non-lethal’’ or “less-lethal’’ products, each having a vast global market. The\nfour market segments are as follows:\ni) Public order (riots and control of dangerous subjects);\nii) Military and law enforcement training (realistic force-on-force training);\niii) Personal defence (home, car, boat, RV, camping, hiking); and\niv) High-action gaming.\nWith recent events of riots / widespread protests in the U.S. leading to fatalities, management believes the LEC\nTechnology will position KWESST well to address this potentially large market demand for non-lethal devices.\nAt closing, KWESST issued 1 million common shares of KWESST and 500,000 share purchase warrants of\nKWESST at $0.70 each (as previously agreed on June 6, 2020 in a binding letter of agreement) subject to 25%\nannual vesting from the closing date. The Warrants will expire on April 29, 2026. Further, KWESST will pay a 7%\n7 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021\nroyalty on annual sales of the LEC System, subject to annual minimum royalty payments starting on the 2nd\nanniversary of the closing date. Based on estimated fair value measurement, management determined the total\npurchase consideration for this asset acquisition was $2.8 million. Refer to Note 4(a) of the 2021 Interim FS for\nmore fulsome disclosure, including the minimum annual royalty payment commitment.\nThis asset acquisition was a related party transaction because DEFSEC is a private company owned by David\nLuxton, KWESST’s Executive Chairman. Mr. Luxton recused himself from the Board deliberations and approval\nof this transaction. While this asset acquisition did not require the formal valuation and minority shareholder\napproval under Multilateral Instrument 61-101, Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions, we\nnevertheless obtained written approval from over 51% disinterested shareholders as well as from the TSX-V prior\nto closing.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following selected financial data has been extracted from 2021 Interim FS.\nQuarter ended June 30, Change Nine months ended June 30, Change\n2021 2020% 2021 2020%\nRevenue $ 521,724 $ 600,474 -13% $ 1,115,757 $ 653,174 71%\nCost of sales 315,273 143,536 120% 718,309 159,527 350%\nGross profit 206,451 456,938 -55% 397,448 493,647 -19%\nGross margin % 39.6% 76.1% 35.6% 75.6%\nOperating expenses 2,797,871 1,047,622 167% 6,753,707 2,424,030 179%\nOperating loss (2,591,420) (590,684) 339% (6,356,259) (1,930,383) 229%\nFair value adjustments on derivatives - (89,489) -100% - (64,948) -100%\nGain on government grant - - 3,514 -\nNet finance costs (27,780) (81,546) -66% (64,371) (158,687) -59%\nForeign exchange loss (9,025) (14,549) -38% (14,189) (9,727) 46%\nNet loss $ ( 2,628,225) $ ( 776,268) 239% $ ( 6,431,305) $ ( 2,163,745) 197%\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) $ ( 2,057,558) $ ( 411,463) 400% $ ( 4,868,894) $ ( 1,671,710) 191%\nEarnings (loss) per share - basic and diluted $ (0.06) $ (0.03) 124% $ (0.15) $ (0.10) 51%\nWeighted average common shares - basic 46,016,645 30,393,359 43,126,552 21,860,441\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure. See ‘’Non-IFRS Measures”’. See below for ‘’Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measure’’.\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2021 (herein referred to as Q3 Fiscal 2021), KWESST incurred a net loss of $2.6\nmillion or $0.06 loss per basic share, compared to net loss of $0.8 million or $0.03 loss per basic share for the\nsame period in Fiscal 2020. For the nine months ended June 30, 2021 (herein referred to as “YTD Fiscal 2021”),\nKWESST incurred a net loss of $6.4 million or $0.15 per share, compared to net loss of $2.2 million or $0.10 loss\nper basic share for the same period in Fiscal 2020.\nWhile KWESST experienced significant revenue growth for YTD Fiscal 2021, it also made significant investments\nthroughout the organization over the last twelve months to position KWESST for success which resulted in\nincurring operating expenses greater than KWESST’s earned gross profit for both periods. See below Operating\nExpenses (“OPEX”) for further details on the increase in OPEX.\n8 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021\nReconciliation of Non-IFRS Measure\nKWESST has presented EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in this MD&A to provide readers with a supplemental\nmeasure of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be\napparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. We believe the securities analysts, investors, and other\ninterested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in evaluating the company’s performance. Management\nalso uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period,\nprepare annual operating budgets and assess our ability to meet our capital expenditure and working capital\nrequirements.\nIn the following table, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are reconciled to the most comparable IFRS financial\nmeasure.\nQuarter ended June 30, Nine months ended June 30,\n2021 2020 2021 2020\nNet loss as reported under IFRS $ ( 2,628,225) $ ( 776,268) $ ( 6,431,305) $ ( 2,163,745)\nNet finance costs 27,780 81,546 64,371 158,687\nDepreciation and amortization 13,439 53,925 88,484 112,711\nEBITDA loss (2,587,006) (640,797) (6,278,450) (1,892,347)\nOther adjustments:\nStock-based compensation 520,423 125,296 1,398,881 145,962\nFair value adjustments on derivatives - 89,489 - 64,948\nGain on government grant - - (3,514) -\nForeign exchange loss 9,025 14,549 14,189 9,727\nAdjusted EBITDA loss $ ( 2,057,558) $ ( 411,463) $ ( 4,868,894) $ ( 1,671,710)\nFor Q3 and YTD Fiscal 2021, KWESST’s Adjusted EBITDA loss was $2.1 million and $4.9 million, an increase of\n$1.6 million and $3.2 million, respectively, over the comparable periods. Share-based compensation accounted\nfor most of the adjustments to EBITDA. The significant increase in both periods in Fiscal 2021 compared to the\nsame periods in Fiscal 2020 is mainly due to granting a higher volume of options at a higher fair value per option\nfor recruiting and retaining directors, executives and key business consultants. The total outstanding options was\n3.7 million at June 30, 2021, compared to 1.2 million at June 30, 2020. Refer to Note 14 of the 2021 Interim FS\nfor further details on stock option activities. There were no stock options granted prior to Q1 Fiscal 2020.\nRevenue and Gross Profit\nQuarter ended June 30, Nine months ended June 30,\n2021 2020 Change 2021 2020 Change\nTASCS system $ 4 97,792 $ 596,439 $ (98,647) $ 1,080,933 $ 631,719 $ 4 49,214\nOther 23,932 4,035 1 9,897 34,824 21,455 1 3,369\nTotal revenue $ 5 21,724 $ 600,474 $ (78,750) $ 1,115,757 $ 653,174 $ 4 62,583\nGross profit $ 2 06,451 $ 4 56,938 $ ( 250,487) $ 3 97,448 $ 4 93,647 $ ( 96,199)\nGross margin 39.6% 76.1% 35.6% 75.6%\nFor Q3 Fiscal 2021, total revenue decreased by $0.1 million over the comparable period mainly due to fulfilling\ntwo TASCS system contracts last year; offset partially by KWESST’s first ATAK order during the current quarter.\n9 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021\nDue to the rescheduling of the U.S. military exercises from July 2021 to October 2021, we anticipate minimal\nrevenue to be recognized for the TASCS system during Q4 Fiscal 2021. We are in active discussions with a few\npotential clients for ATAK integration services, which may result in additional ATAK system revenue in the near\nterm.\nFor YTD Fiscal 2021, total revenue increased by 71% to $1.1 million compared to the same period in Fiscal 2020\nmainly due to winning a US$0.8 million U.S. military contract in late in Q1 Fiscal 2021 for KWESST’s TASCS IFM\nmortar system. Revenue for this contract is being recognized on a percentage of completion basis, based on\nprojected total hours. We expect to fully deliver under this contract during Q1 of Fiscal 2022.\nThe gross margin was 39.6% and 35.6% for Q3 and YTD Fiscal 2021, respectively, compared to 76.1% and\n75.6%, respectively, for the same prior periods. Comparison to prior year gross margins is not meaningful due to\nKWESST’s product lines being pre-commercialization stage, except for ATAK system. Further, margins will vary\nbased on the size and complexity of the customer contracts, coupled with the varying level of non-recurring\nengineering involved for each contract.\nOperating Expenses (OPEX)\nQuarter ended June 30, Nine months ended June 30,\nChange Change\n2021 2020 % 2021 2020 %\nAdvertising and promotion 602,708 78,651 666% 1,427,035 102,666 1290%\nStock-based compensation 520,423 125,296 315% 1,398,881 145,962 858%\nPersonnel costs 554,134 327,067 69% 1,202,607 846,664 42%\nProfessional fees 110,791 62,885 76% 506,254 183,178 176%\nBusiness development 200,011 127,451 57% 424,371 212,996 99%\nR&D consulting and material costs, net 173,107 26,805 546% 423,892 207,773 104%\nConsulting fees 160,396 99,022 62% 416,720 328,135 27%\nRoyalty and license costs 287,000 - NM 287,000 - NM\nGeneral and administrative expenses 86,569 29,454 194% 167,089 37,838 342%\nTravel and conferences 14,588 25,998 -44% 138,958 138,742 0%\nInsurance 44,982 9,161 391% 104,617 25,458 311%\nTransfer agent and TSX-V fees 28,455 - NM 90,168 - NM\nDepreciation and amortization 13,439 53,925 -75% 88,484 112,711 -21%\nImpairment of intangible assets - - NM 55,376 - NM\nMerger and acquisition costs 1,268 81,907 -98% 22,255 81,907 -73%\nTotal operating expenses $ 2,797,871 $ 1 ,047,622 167% $ 6,753,707 $ 2 ,424,030 179%\nNM – not meaningful\nTotal OPEX increased by 167% or $1.8 million for the current quarter over the comparable prior period. The\nincrease was driven primarily by:\n• $0.5 million in advertising and promotion to promote and increase awareness of KWESST and its new\nproduct offerings to position the company for success;\n• $0.4 million in share-based compensation due to KWESST granting significant stock options over the last\n12 months to recruit and retain directors, key employees and consultants;\n• $0.3 million in royalty and license costs due to the fair value recognition of the 100,000 common shares\nof KWESST issued to AerialX as consideration for the Exclusivity under the amended and restated license\nagreement and the charge on the Advance as previously noted above (see Business Highlights For the\nQuarter Ended June 30, 2021 in the Overview section of this MD&A);\n10 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021\n• $0.2 million in personnel costs due to an increase in headcount from seven at June 30, 2020 to fifteen at\nJune 30, 2021; partially offset by payroll costs allocated to WIP inventories; and\n• $0.1 million in R&D mainly due to ramping up product development with investments allocated to\nPhantomTM, Laser Defense systems, and GreyGhost (see Use of Proceeds from Financings in the\nLiquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A).\nTotal OPEX increased by 179% or $4.3 million for YTD Fiscal 2021 over the comparable prior period. The\nincrease was driven by the same reasons as noted above for Q3 Fiscal 2021 in addition to:\n• $0.3 million in professional fees driven by the increase in regulatory compliance costs as a result of going\npublic, coupled with additional legal fees for proposed financing transactions as well as assistance with\nKWESST’s Long-Term Incentive Plan and annual general meeting documents;\n• $0.2 million in business development costs due to entering into a consulting agreement with SageGuild\nLLC to promote and facilitate the sale of KWESST’s product offerings in the United States, coupled with\nthe addition of a sales consultant to focus on the Canadian military market (effective January 2021\nSageGuild LLC is a related party – see Related Party Transactions section of this MD&A);\n• $0.1 million increase in consulting fees mainly driven by external engineering consulting for the\ndevelopment of the LEC System;\n• $0.1 million in general and administrative costs mainly due to increase spend for new office location as\nwell as an increase in software licensing fees and telecommunication costs due to an increase in\nheadcount; and\n• $0.1 million in transfer agent and TSX-V fees as a result of being a public company.\nGain on Derivatives\nIn Q1 Fiscal 2019, KWESST issued $0.6 million of convertible notes and as a result it accounted for the conversion\nfeature as a derivative liability at fair value at closing. This derivative liability is remeasured quarterly with the\nchange in fair value reported in earnings.\nAccordingly, KWESST recognized a fair value loss on derivative liability of $89 thousand for Q3 Fiscal 2020 and\na fair value loss of $65 thousand for YTD Fiscal 2020. The non-cash loss incurred was due to conversion feature\nbecoming “in-the-money” following a capital raise priced higher than the conversion rate for the convertible notes.\nThese convertible notes were all converted to KWESST common shares in Q4 of Fiscal 2020 as a result of\nKWESST going public and accordingly there is no further outstanding derivative liability since September 30,\n2020.\n11 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021\nNet Finance Costs\nThe following table shows the breakdown of net finance costs:\nQuarter ended June 30, Nine months ended June 30,\n2021 2020 % 2021 2020 %\nInterest expense from:\nLease obligations $ ( 2,891) $ 1 5,734 -118% $ 2 5,916 $ 40,257 -36%\nAccretion cost - accrued royalties liability 25,567 - 25,567 -\nRelated party loans 628 2,513 -75% 4,581 13,312 -66%\nUnsecured loan 2,817 - 4,527 -\nCEBA term loan 1,221 - 3,228 -\n2019 convertible notes - 9,683 -100% - 48,911 -100%\n2020 convertible notes - 63,553 -100% - 63,553 -100%\nOther 1,042 7,590 -86% 3,784 10,418 -64%\nTotal interest expense 28,384 99,073 -71% 67,603 176,451 -62%\nInterest income (604) - (3,232) (237) 1264%\nGain on termination of lease obligation - (17,527) -100% - (17,527) -100%\nNet finance costs $ 27,780 $ 8 1,546 -66% $ 6 4,371 $ 158,687 -59%\nTotal net finance costs for Q3 Fiscal 2021 and YTD Fiscal 2021 declined by 66% and 59% compared to the same\nperiods in Fiscal 2020. This reduction is primarily due to the conversion of all convertible notes to KWESST\ncommon shares in Q4 Fiscal 2020 in addition to lower financing costs relating to the current office lease entered\nin March 2020 including an immaterial adjustment for the accrued interest during the current quarter. The\nreduction in both periods was partially offset by the accretion costs relating to CEBA term loan and the accrued\nroyalties liability in respect to the future minimum royalty payments due to DEFSEC for the LEC System\nacquisition. Accrued royalties liability was initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized\ncost.\nFor Q3 Fiscal 2020 and YTD Fiscal 2020, KWESST also recognized a gain on termination for the former office\nlease obligation. We vacated the former office space due to breach of contract by the landlord.\n12 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021\nKey Balance Sheet Items\nThe following table summarizes KWESST’s financial position:\nJune 30, September 30,\n2021 2020\n(adjusted)\nAssets\nCurrent $ 3,874,249 $ 3 ,996,514\nNon-current 3,841,690 1 ,316,263\nTotal assets $ 7 ,715,939 $ 5 ,312,777\nLiabilities\nCurrent $ 1,028,049 $ 1 ,120,004\nNon-current 1,310,145 3 07,909\nTotal liabilities $ 2,338,194 $ 1 ,427,913\nNet assets $ 5 ,377,745 $ 3 ,884,864\nChanges since September 30, 2020:\nCurrent assets decreased by $0.1 million mainly due to $4.7 million cash used in operating activities, offset partially\nby gross proceeds of $4.4 million from the 2021 Financing (see Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this\nMD&A).\nNon-current assets increased by $2.5 million mainly due to an increase in intangible assets relating to the LEC\nSystem acquisition.\nCurrent liabilities decreased by $0.1 million mainly due to $0.2 million repayment of related party loans, offset\npartially by an increase in trade payables and accrued liabilities.\nNon-current liabilities increased by $1.0 million mainly due to the accrued royalties liability relating to the estimated\nfair value of the future annual minimum annual royalty payable to DEFSEC for the LEC System acquisition.\nAs a result, KWESST’s net assets increased by $1.5 million to $5.4 million at June 30, 2021.\nDuring the quarter, we have adjusted the lease assets and related obligations at September 30, 2020 to correct\nthe application of IFRS 16, Leases.

As a result, the net loss for these periods were also adjusted accordingly. This resulted in no change\nto the total foreign exchange loss as reported in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(2) Operating expenses were adjusted due to cut-off error in recording the reversal of an accrual for consulting fees, resulting in reallocating the reversal of $85\nthousand to Q2 FY2019 from Q1 FY2020. As a result, the net loss for these periods were also adjusted accordingly. This resulted in no change to the total\nconsulting fees as reported in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(3) Operating expenses, Other income (expenses), and Net income (loss) were adjusted to correct for the application of IFRS 16, Leases, for the office lease\nagreement entered in March 2020. This resulted in a favorable adjustment to net income (loss) of $10 thousand and $18 thousand for Q3 FY2020 and Q4FY2020,\nrespectively, for total favorable adjustment of $28k to Fiscal 2020.\n(4) Operating expenses were adjusted to increase it by $78 thousand for additional share-based compensation expense relating to a partially cancelled option grant.\nQuarterly Results Trend Analysis\nKWESST’s historical quarterly operating results have been volatile because it is an early-stage company in the\npre-commercialization phase. Since KWESST’s incorporation in late 2017, we have devoted significant energy\nto developing our proprietary TASCS system, our signature app and snap-on weapon adaptor that enables real-\ntime streaming of situational awareness data of any kind from any source, including drones, direct to smart devices\nand operational assets, for a common operating picture and networked engagement. During 2018 and 2019,\n14 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021\nKWESST also invested significant time in doing demonstrations of our early prototypes to U.S. customers which\nled to entering into two teaming agreements with AeroVironment Inc. and ManTech International Corporation.\nThese agreements led to more meaningful revenues in Fiscals 2020 and 2021.\nThe general trend of increased quarterly operating expenses reflects the investments being made to grow\nKWESST’s business, coupled with significant investments in promoting the Company’s profile and its product\nofferings. More recently, with the LEC System acquisition, we made further investments to accelerate the timing\nfor launching this product line by January 2022.\nOver the next 12 months, management expects continued volatility in KWESST’s quarterly revenue, operating\nresults, and cash flows for the foreseeable future as KWESST continues to invest in promoting KWESST and its\nproduct offerings, product development and bringing products to market.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nKWESST has financed its operations to date through the issuance of common shares and to a lesser extent\nrevenue. To fund KWESST’s business growth strategies, we may need to raise additional capital from time to\ntime. On April 29, 2021, KWESST raised gross proceeds of $4.4 million in equity - see 2021 Financing below for\nfurther details.\nOur approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we always have sufficient liquidity to\nmeet our liabilities as they come due. We do so by continuously monitoring cash flow and actual operating\nexpenses.\nKWESST’s cash position decreased to $2.4 million at June 30, 2021, from $3.1 million at September 30, 2020,\nprimarily due to the net operating loss incurred during YTD Fiscal 2021 offset partially by additional new capital.\nOur principal cash requirements are for working capital and product development investments. KWESST’s\nworking capital as at June 30, 2021 was approximately $2.8 million, in line with September 30, 2020.\nThe following table provides a summary of cash inflows and outflows by activity:\nThree months ended June 30, Nine months ended June 30,\n2021 2020 % 2021 2020 %\nCash inflows (outflows) by activity:\nOperting activities $ ( 1,624,340) $ ( 94,615)1617% $ ( 4,718,229) $ ( 1,659,940) 184%\nInvesting activities (238,659) (295,603)-19% (299,909) (515,418) -42%\nFinancing acitivities 3,547,357 1,165,014 204% 4,376,504 3,447,316 27%\nNet cash inflows (outflows) $ 1 ,684,358 $ 7 74,796 117% $ ( 641,634) $ 1 ,271,958 -150%\nCash used by operating activities\nWith the additional capital raised during the last 12 months, we continued to invest significantly across the\norganization and product development. As an early-stage company with various products in the pipeline (pre-\ncommercialization phase), KWESST’s revenue remains low and insufficient to cover the increase in overhead\ncosts, professional fees, advertising and promotion costs, and R&D costs. As a result, cash flow used in operating\nactivities was $1.6 million and $4.7 million for Q3 Fiscal 2021 and YTD Fiscal 2021, respectively, compared to\n$0.1 million and $1.7 million for the comparable prior periods, respectively.\n15 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021\nCash used by investing activities\nCash flow used in investing activities declined by 19% and 42% for Q3 Fiscal 2021 and YTD Fiscal 2021,\nrespectively, mainly due to investments in capitalized developments projects and the cash consideration for the\nacquisition of the PhantomTM system from SageGuild LLC in the comparable prior periods.\nCash provided by financing activities\nCash provided by financing activities increased by 204% and 27% for Q3 Fiscal 2021 and YTD Fiscal 2021,\nrespectively mainly because of higher equity raises in private placements (see below 2021 Financing) and\nproceeds from exercised options and warrants; partially offset by repayments of related party loans and lease\nobligations.\n2021 Financing\nOn April 29, 2021, KWESST closed its previously announced over-subscribed brokered private placement,\nresulting in the issuance of 3,536,057 units (“Units”) of KWESST, at a price of $1.25 per Unit (the “Issue Price”),\nfor aggregate gross proceeds of $4.4 million (the “Offering”). Subsequent to June 30, 2021, the Lead Agent (PI\nFinancial Corp.) discovered it had erroneously omitted one subscription for 40,000 units or $50,000 from the\nOffering. Following TSX-V approval on an exception basis, KWESST accepted this additional subscription in\nAugust 2021.\nAccordingly, the net proceeds from this Offering were as follows:\nGross proceeds $ 4,470,071\nLess:\nBroker's cash commission (288,405)\nLegal fees and other expenses (172,443)\nNet proceeds $ 4,009,223\nUnder the Offering, KWESST sold a total of 3,576,057 units at a price of $1.25 per Unit.

Upon receipt of such notice, the holders of Warrants shall have 30 days to exercise the Warrants, failing\nwhich the Warrants will automatically expire.\nThe Offering was completed by PI Financial Corp. as lead agent and sole bookrunner and other dealers (the\n\"Agents\"). As consideration for the services provided by the Agents in connection with the Offering, the Agents\nreceived: (a) a cash commission of $288,405; and (b) 230,734 compensation options (the “Compensation\nOptions”). Each Compensation Option is exercisable to acquire one unit of the Company (a “Compensation Option\nUnit”) at a price equal to $1.25 for a period of two years after the closing of the Offering. Each Compensation\nOption Unit is comprised of one Common Share and one Common Share purchase warrant (a “Compensation\nOption Warrant\"). Each Compensation Option Warrant is exercisable to acquire one Common Share (a\n\"Compensation Option Warrant Share\") at a price of $1.75 per Compensation Option Warrant Share for a period\nof 24 months from the closing of the Offering.\n16 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nTHREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2021\nDirectors and officers of KWESST (the “Insiders”) purchased 72,000 Units for a total consideration of $90,000.\nThe issuance of Units to the Insiders constitutes a related party transaction but is exempt from the formal valuation\nand minority approval requirements of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in\nSpecial Transactions (\"MI 61-101”) as KWESST’s securities are not listed on any stock exchange identified in\nSection 5.5(b) of MI 61-101 and neither the fair market value of the units issued to the Insiders, nor the fair market\nvalue of the entire private placement, exceeds 25% of the Company’s market capitalization.

This MD&A has been\nprepared with an effective date of November 23, 2021.\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September\n30, 2021 (“Fiscal 2021”). The financial information presented in this MD&A is derived from these consolidated financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International\nAccounting Standards Board (“IASB”). This MD&A contains forward-looking statements involves risk, uncertainties and\nassumptions, including statements regarding anticipated developments in future financial periods and our future plans and\nobjectives. There can be no assurance that such information will prove to be accurate, and readers are cautioned not to place\nundue reliance on such forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements”.\nAll references to $ or dollar amounts in this MD&A are to Canadian currency unless otherwise indicated.\nAdditional information, including press releases, relating to KWESST is available for view on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nIn this MD&A, we have presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA\nthat has been adjusted for the removal of one-time, irregular and nonrecurring items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) to provide\nreaders with a supplemental measure of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may\nnot otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management also uses non-IFRS measures, in\naddition to IFRS financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and\noperational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe\nthat these non-IFRS financial measures enable us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise by hidden\nby the effect of certain expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-IFRS financial measures.\nAccordingly, we believe that these non-IFRS financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for\nmeaningful comparisons and analysis in the business and provides useful information to investors and securities analysts, and\nother interested parties in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing their overall understanding of our\npast performance and future prospects.\nWe caution readers that these non-IFRS financial measures do not replace the presentation of our IFRS financial results and\nshould only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. There\nare limitations in the use of non-IFRS measures because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under\nIFRS as well as they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-IFRS financial\nmeasure. Furthermore, other peers may use other non-IFRS measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-\nIFRS measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS financial measures as tools for\ncomparison.\nGOING CONCERN\nAs an early-stage company, KWESST has not yet reached commercial production of its products and has incurred significant\nlosses and negative operating cash flows from inception that have primarily been funded from financing activities.\nKWESST’s audited consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2021 have been prepared on the “going concern’’ basis which\npresumes that KWESST will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the\nforeseeable future.

We calculated this based\non costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. As a percentage of total revenue, our revenue has\nbeen concentrated as follows: 95.1% by one customer in Fiscal 2021, 96.9% by two customers in Fiscal 2020, and 92.9% by\none customer in Fiscal 2019.\nWith the expected commercial launch of our LEC System devices during the second quarter of Fiscal 2022, we expect revenue\nfor these devices will be generated through the wholesale distribution of our products to dealers / distributors and through an\ne-commerce portal to consumers. We expect the transfer of control for our LEC System devices to take place at shipment and\naccordingly, revenue will be recognized at that point in time.\nWe expect product revenue to accelerate in Fiscal 2022 with the commercial launch of the LEC System, coupled with a new\nservice revenue stream for the ATAK integration services for prospective customers. Accordingly, we expect our revenue\nwill continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in Fiscal 2022.\nCost of Sales / Gross Profit\nCost of sales include cost of finished goods, freight, and direct overhead expenses.\n7 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nWe expect our gross profit will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter with the anticipated new product mix and sales\nvolume.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are presented by function as follows: general and administration (“G&A”), selling and marketing\n(“S&M”), and net research and development (“R&D”).\nG&A expenses consist of corporate personnel costs, various management and administrative support functions, insurance,\nregulatory and other public company costs, professional fees relating to corporate matters, corporate advisory consulting\ncosts, M&A related costs, depreciation and amortization expenses, and occupancy costs related to G&A costs. We expect to\ncontinue to scale-up our operations organically and through strategic acquisitions in Fiscal 2022.\nS&M expenses consist of business development costs related to the market development activities and product\ncommercialization, marketing support function, depreciation and amortization expenses and investor relations support\nfunction. With the anticipated commercial launch of the LEC System, we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing\nto promote the LEC product suite, particularly in the United States, as well as other product lines.\nR&D expenses consist of costs incurred in performing R&D activities, including new product development, continuous\nproduct development, materials and supplies, personnel costs, external engineering consulting, patent procurement costs,\ndepreciation and amortization expenses, and occupancy costs related to R&D activity. These costs are net of Canadian\ninvestment tax credits for qualified Scientific Research and Experimental Development (“SR&ED”) projects. We will\ncontinue to invest in R&D in Fiscal 2022 to bring innovative products to market and claim related investment tax credits for\nqualified SR&ED projects.\nFinance Costs\nOur finance costs are primarily comprised of interest and accretion expenses relating to the borrowings and accrued royalties\npayable relating to the acquired LEC System technology. From this total, we net interest income and the gain from the\nCanadian government subsidy relating to the COVID-19 loan program (which we refer to as the “CEBA Term Loan”).\nUpdate on COVID-19\nWhile COVID-19 has not had a material impact to our business to date, the following is a summary of what we believe may\nimpact our future business given the persistency of COVID-19: disruptions to business operations resulting from quarantines\nof employees, customers, manufacturers and other third-party service providers in areas affected by the outbreak; disruptions\nto business operations resulting from travel restrictions, including travel to industry tradeshows; and uncertainty around the\nduration of the virus' impact.\nDespite the global vaccination efforts underway, the extent to which COVID-19 could impact our operations, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and cash flows is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Negative financial results,\nuncertainties in the market, and a tightening of credit markets, caused by COVID-19, or a recession, could have a material\nadverse effect on our liquidity and ability to obtain financing in the future.\n8 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the respective periods:\nYear ended Nine months ended\nQuarter ended September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2021 2020 2021 2020\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited)\nRevenue $ 160,047 $ 212,485 $ 1,275,804 $ 861,917\nCost of sales (80,579) (95,473) (798,888) (247,113)\nGross profit 79,468 117,012 476,916 614,804\nGross margin % 49.7% 55.1% 37.4% 71.3%\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and administrative 1,147,817 1,959,077 4,057,167 2,723,861\nSelling and marketing 1,288,512 269,450 3,484,159 564,266\nR&D 489,427 162,801 2,138,138 817,584\nTotal operating expenses 2,925,756 2,391,328 9,679,464 4,105,711\nOperating loss (2,846,288) (2,274,316) (9,202,548) (3,490,907)\nGain on derivatives - 207,589 - 29,463\nNet finance costs (46,894) 45,059 (107,751) (61,397)\nForeign exchange gain (loss) 10,484 (4,982) (3,742) (13,937)\nLoss on disposals (1,331) - (1,331) -\nNet loss $ (2,884,029) $ (2,026,650) $ (9,315,372) $ (3,536,778)\nEBITDA $ (2,784,629) $ (2,056,538) $ (9,066,878) $ (3,371,984)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (1,730,456) $ (593,244) $ (6,599,598) $ (1,589,723)\nLoss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.06) $ (0.07) $ (0.21) $ (0.11)\nWeighted average common shares - basic 46,016,645 30,393,359 44,290,536 30,844,129\nIn the following table, we have reconciled the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable IFRS financial\nmeasure.\nYear ended Nine months ended\nQuarter ended September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2021 2020 2021 2020\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited)\nNet loss as reported under IFRS $ ( 2,884,029) $ ( 2,026,650) $ ( 9,315,372) $ ( 3,536,778)\nNet finance costs 4 6,894 ( 45,059) 1 07,751 6 1,397\nDepreciation and amortization 5 2,506 1 5,171 1 40,743 1 03,397\nEBITDA loss ( 2,784,629) ( 2,056,538) ( 9,066,878) ( 3,371,984)\nOther adjustments:\nNon-cash M&A costs - 1 ,514,703 - 1,514,703\nStock-based compensation 1,063,326 1 51,198 2,462,207 283,084\nFair value adjustments on derivatives - ( 207,589) - (29,463)\nForeign exchange loss (gain) ( 10,484) 4,982 3,742 13,937\nLoss on disposal 1,331 - 1,331 -\nAdjusted EBITDA loss $ ( 1,730,456) $ ( 593,244) $ ( 6,599,598) $ ( 1,589,723)\n9 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nFor Q4 and Fiscal 2021, KWESST’s Adjusted EBITDA loss was $1.7 million and $6.6 million, an increase of $1.1 million\nand $5.0 million, respectively, over the comparable periods. Share-based compensation accounted for most of the adjustments\nto EBITDA. The significant increase in share-based compensation in Q4 and Fiscal 2021 compared to the same periods in\nFiscal 2020 is mainly due to granting a higher volume of options at a higher fair value per option for recruiting and retaining\ndirectors, executives and key business consultants. In Q4 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020 (“Fiscal 2020”),\nwe incurred non-cash M&A costs of $1.5 million relating to the Qualifying Transaction for going public (refer to Note 4(b)\nof the Fiscal 2021 FS).\nRevenue and Gross Profit\n2020 to Year ended Nine months ended Annualized\nQuarter ended September 30, 2021 September 30, September 30, Annualized (1) 2020 to 2021\n2021 2020 % 2021 2020 2020 %\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited)\nDigitization systems $ 157,871 $ 203,379 -22% $ 1,255,983 $ 835,097 $ 1,113,463 13%\nOther 2,176 9,106 -76% 19,821 26,820 35,760 -45%\nTotal revenue $ 160,047 $ 212,485 -25% $ 1,275,804 $ 861,917 $ 1,149,223 11%\nGross profit $ 79,468 $ 117,011 $ 476,916 $ 614,804\nGross margin 49.7% 55.1% 37.4% 71.3%\n(1) Annualized is not indicative of actual results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. We have presented annualized figures to facilitate the comparison to the prior year.\nWe earned $1.3 million in revenue for Fiscal 2021, compared to $0.9 million for Fiscal 2020. On an annualized basis, our\ntotal revenue increased by 11% over the prior year mainly due to one large contract with a United States military customer\nrelating to our TASCS IFM system. At the end of Fiscal 2021, we estimated approximately 98.3% completion on this large\ncontract and have since fully delivered the remaining performance obligation since September 30, 2021. For both Fiscal 2021\nand 2020, 97% of our total revenue was from the United States. For Q4 Fiscal 2021, our revenue decreased by 25% compared\nto Q4 Fiscal 2020. Comparability quarter over quarter is not very meaningful due to pre-commercialization phase.\nOur gross margin was 50% for Q4 Fiscal 2021, compared to 55% for the same period in 2020. For Fiscal 2021, our gross\nmargin was 37% compared to 71% for Fiscal 2020. The fluctuation in gross profit / margin is due to our pre-\ncommercialization phase. Further, the contract that was awarded to us in Fiscal 2021 was significantly more complex in\nnature, requiring significant judgement during the bidding process in estimating the engineering labor hours to meet the\ncustomer requirements. We incurred more engineering labor hours than anticipated, which contributed to the lower gross\nmargin in Fiscal 2021.\nOperating Expenses (OPEX)\n2020 to Year ended Nine months ended Annualized\nQuarter ended September 30, 2021 September 30, September 30, Annualized (1) 2020 to 2021\n2021 2020 % 2021 2020 2020 %\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited)\nGeneral and administrative $ 1,147,817 $ 1,959,077 -41% $ 4,057,167 $ 2,723,861 3,631,815 12%\nSelling and marketing 1,288,512 269,450 378% 3,484,159 564,266 752,355 363%\nResearch and development 489,427 162,801 201% 2,138,138 817,584 1,090,112 96%\nTotal operating expenses $ 2,925,756 $ 2,391,328 22% $ 9,679,464 $ 4,105,711 $ 5,474,281 136%\n(1) Annualized is not indicative of actual results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. We have presented annualized figures to facilitate the comparison to the prior year.\nTotal operating expenses were $9.7 million for Fiscal 2021, compared to $4.1 million for Fiscal 2020. Excluding M&A costs,\non an annualized basis total operating expenses increased by 185% driven primarily by growth in G&A, S&M and R&D.\n• G&A increased by 12% on an annualized basis; however, excluding the M&A costs, our G&A increased by 160%\nprimarily due to augmenting the senior management team with two executives and recruiting independent directors,\nwhich led to a significant increase in personnel costs, including share-based compensation. Further, as a result of\n10 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nbecoming a public company in Canada late in Fiscal 2020, we are now incurring significantly more regulatory costs\nand director and officer insurance premium costs.\n• S&M increased by 363% on an annualized basis primarily due to making an investment in promoting and increasing\nawareness about us and our product offerings, including the recruitment of Brandon Tatum, through his private\ncompany The Officer Tatum LLC, as our advisor and advocate for our LEC System for law enforcement and\npersonal defense in the United States in advance of our commercial launch of the LEC System anticipated for\nJanuary 2022. We compensate Officer Tatum primarily in non-cash consideration, RSUs and PSUs. Additionally,\nwe made further investments in business development by recruiting consultants in the United States and in Canada\nto promote our product offerings.\n• Excluding the investment tax credits (“ITCs”), R&D increased by 86% on an annualized basis primarily due to an\nincrease in headcount to accelerate product development. We recognized $0.2 million and $0.1 million of ITCs in\nthe fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, relating to qualified SR&ED projects. Recognition takes\nplace only once we have completed our analysis on whether certain R&D projects qualify for SR&ED ITCs with\nthe assistance of our external tax professionals.\nTotal operating expenses were $2.9 million for Q4 Fiscal 2021, compared to $2.4 million for Q4 Fiscal 2020. Excluding\nM&A costs, on an annualized basis total operating expenses increased by 221% driven primarily by growth in G&A, S&M\nand R&D for the same reason as noted above.\nGain on Derivatives\nThe gain on derivatives in Fiscal 2020 relates to the conversion feature of the 2019 Convertible Notes. As a result of the\nQualifying Transaction (see Note 4(b) of the Fiscal 2021 FS), all the 2019 Convertible Notes were converted to KWESST’s\ncommon shares, resulting in the recognition of a gain on derivatives of $207,409 and $29,463 for Q4 and Fiscal 2020,\nrespectively.\nNet Finance Costs\nThe following table provides a breakdown of KWESST’s net finance costs for the respective periods:\n2020 to Year ended Nine months ended Annualized\nQuarter ended September 30, 2021 September 30, September 30, Annualized (1) 2020 to 2021\n2021 2020 % 2021 2020 2020 %\nInterest expense from: (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited)\nAccretion cost - accrued royalties liability $ 38,970 $ - $ 64,537 $ - $ -\nLease obligations 9,574 5,889 63% 33,872 31,242 41,656 -19%\nRelated party loans - 2,335 -100% 4,581 8,448 11,264 -59%\nUnsecured loan - - 4,527 - -\nCEBA term loan 1,253 - 4,481 - -\n2019 convertible notes - 35,216 -100% - 44,899 59,865 -100%\n2020 convertible notes - (69,400) -100% - - -\nOther 331 (7,786) -104% 4,115 5,885 7,847 -48%\nTotal interest expense 50,128 (33,746) -249% 116,113 90,474 120,632 -4%\nInterest income (3,234) (2,217) 46% (4,848) (2,454) (3,272) 48%\nGain on termination of lease obligation - - - (17,527) (23,369) -100%\nGain on government grant - (9,096) (3,514) (9,096) (12,128) NM\nNet finance costs $ 46,894 $ (45,059) -204% $ 107,751 $ 61,397 $ 81,863 32%\n(1) Annualized is not indicative of actual results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020. We have presented annualized figures to facilitate the comparison to the prior year.\nFor Q4 Fiscal 2021, our net finance costs were $47 thousand, compared to negative $45 thousand over the same period in\nFiscal 2020 primarily due to the reversal of accrued interest on the 2020 convertible notes as a result of classifying these\nnotes as equity rather than debt during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020 (see Note 16(a) of the Fiscal 2021 FS for further\ndetails), coupled with the recognition of $9 thousand of gain on government grant relating to the CEBA Term Loan (see\nsection “Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources”).\n11 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nOn an annualized basis, our net finance costs increased by 32% in Fiscal 2021 over Fiscal 2020. The increase was driven\nprimarily by the accretion cost on the accrued royalties liability relating to the acquisition of the LEC System. This was offset\npartially by finance cost savings from the conversion of the 2019 convertible notes into KWESST common shares, coupled\nwith gains on government grant and terminations of lease obligation on the former office lease.\nNet Loss\nWe incurred a net loss of $9.3 million or $0.21 per basic share for Fiscal 2021, compared to the net loss of $3.5 million or\n$0.11 per basic share for Fiscal 2020. For Q4 Fiscal 2021, we incurred a net loss of $2.9 million or $0.06 per basic share,\ncompared to net loss of $2.0 million or $0.07 per basic share for the same period in 2020. The increase in net loss in both\nperiods was primarily due to investments made to drive marketing and promotional activities about KWESST and our product\nofferings, accelerating product development, and recruiting talent to position ourselves for success.\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS\nThe following tables summarize selected results for the eight most recent completed quarters to September 30, 2021\n(unaudited).\nDecember 2020 March 2021 June 2021 September 2021\n($ in thousands, except per share) (Q1 FY21) (Q2 FY21) (Q3 FY21) (Q4 2021)\nRevenue $ 146 $ 448 $ 522 $ 160\nCost of sales $ 72 $ 332 $ 3 15 $ 80\nGross profit $ 74 $ 116 $ 207 $ 80\nGross margin % 50.7% 25.9% 39.7% 50.0%\nOperating expenses $ 1 ,580 $ 2,376 $ 2,798 $ 2,925\nOperating loss $ ( 1,506) $ (2,260) $ (2,591) $ (2,845)\nOther income (expenses) $ ( 21) $ ( 17) $ ( 37) $ (38)\nNet income (loss) $ ( 1,527) $ ( 2,277) $ ( 2,628) $ (2,883)\nAdjusted EBITDA (loss) $ ( 1,124) $ (1,627) $ ( 2,017) $ (1,888)\nEarnings (loss) per share - basic and diluted $ (0.04) $ ( 0.05) $ (0.06) $ ( 0.06)\nWeighted average common shares - basic 41,392,149 42,141,523 46,016,645 47,744,525\nDecember 2019 March 2020 June 2020 September 2020\n($ in thousands, except per share) (Q1 FY20) (Q2 FY20) (Q3 FY20) (Q4 2020)\nRevenue $ 4 $ 49 $ 600 $ 213\nCost of sales $ 8 $ 8 $ 144 $ 95\nGross profit $ ( 4) $ 41 $ 456 $ 118\nGross margin % -100.0% 83.7% 76.0% 55.4%\nOperating expenses $ 7 99 $ 6 32 $ 1 ,082 $ 2,392\nOperating loss $ (803) $ (591) $ ( 626) $ (2,274)\nOther income (expenses) $ 6 0 $ (108) $ (186) $ 248\nNet income (loss) $ (743) $ ( 699) $ (812) $ ( 2,026)\nAdjusted EBITDA (loss) $ (779) $ ( 539) $ (392) $ (573)\nEarnings (loss) per share - basic and diluted $ (0.04) $ (0.02) $ (0.03) $ ( 0.07)\nWeighted average common shares - basic 20,767,543 28,695,065 30,393,359 33,024,736\n12 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nQuarterly Results Trend Analysis\nOur historical quarterly operating results have been volatile because we are an early-stage company in the pre-\ncommercialization stage. Since KWESST’s incorporation in late 2017, we have devoted significant energy to developing our\nproprietary TASCS system, our signature app and snap-on weapon adaptor that enables real-time streaming of situational\nawareness data of any kind from any source, including drones, direct to smart devices and operational assets, for a common\noperating picture and networked engagement. In Fiscal 2020, we won two contracts with two U.S. military customers relating\nto our TASCS system. Due to successful military trials held in late Fiscal 2020 on our initial prototype of TASCS system,\nwe were awarded a US$0.8 million contract by a U.S. military customer to further enhance our TASCS system during Q1\nFiscal 2021. We substantially delivered on this contract by the end of Fiscal 2021. Gross margin will continue to vary\nsignificantly from quarter-to-quarter until we reach commercialization phase with our product lines.\nThe general trend of increased quarterly operating expenses reflects the investments being made to grow our business, coupled\nwith significant investments in promoting KWESST’s profile and its product offerings. More recently, with the LEC System\nacquisition, we made further investments to accelerate the timing for launching this product line in January 2022.\nOver the next 12 months, we expect continued volatility in our quarterly revenue, operating results, and cash flows for the\nforeseeable future as we continue to invest in promoting KWESST and its product offerings, product development, and\nbringing products to market.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table summarizes our financial position:\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2021 2020\n(adjusted) (1)\nAssets\nCurrent $ 4,055,697 $ 3,996,514\nNon-current 4,662,149 1,316,263\nTotal assets $ 8,717,846 $ 5,312,777\nLiabilities\nCurrent $ 1,159,490 $ 1,120,004\nNon-current 1,434,628 307,909\nTotal liabilities 2,594,118 1,427,913\nNet assets $ 6,123,728 $ 3,884,864\nWorking capital (2) $ 2,896,207 $ 2,876,510\n(1) See Note 8 of the FY 2021 FS.\n(2) Working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.\nOur working capital was $2.9 million at September 30, 2021, consistent with prior year.

Total liabilities increased by $1.1 million from September 30, 2020, due to an increase of $1.1 million in non-current\nliabilities as a result of recognizing the accrued royalties liability relating to the LEC System.\n13 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary sources of capital to date have been from security offerings, exercise of stock options and warrants, and, to a\nlesser extent, pre-commercial revenue. At September 30, 2021, our cash position was $2.7 million, a decrease of $0.4 million\nsince September 30, 2020 primarily due to incurring a net operating loss for Fiscal 2021, which was partially offset by\nadditional new capital from equity offerings.\nIn Fiscal 2021, we had capital expenditures of $0.9 million, compared to $0.5 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2020, most of which we invested in R&D equipment, product development (where capitalized), office furniture and\nequipment, computer equipment, and leasehold improvements at our corporate office.\nGoing forward, we anticipate our net cash burn rate will be approximately $2.4 million for Q1 Fiscal 2022 and then\nsignificantly reduce to approximately $1.5 million for Q2 Fiscal 2022 and to approximately $0.5 million per quarter for the\nremainder of Fiscal 2022 as a result of the commercial launch of the LEC System and other pending contracts we expect to\nbe awarded for our other product lines.\nWhile we are confident we will be awarded customer contracts in the first quarter of Fiscal 2022, we expect additional capital\nwill be required to initially fund these potential contracts, our commercialization efforts in the United States for the launch\nof the LEC System, R&D activities and our working capital requirements over the next twelve months. Potential sources of\ncapital may include additional equity and/or debt financings, Canadian ITCs for SR&ED activities, and other government\nfunding such as Innovation Solutions Canada. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the capital sufficient\nto meet any or all of our needs. In our view, the availability of capital will be affected by, among other things, capital market\nconditions, the success of our LEC System commercialization efforts, timing for winning new customer contracts, potential\nacquisitions, and other relevant considerations. In the event we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our existing\nshareholders will likely experience dilution, and any additional incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt\nservice obligations and could require us to agree to operational and financial covenants that could further restrict our\noperations. Any failure to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all may require us to significantly change or\ncurtail our current or planned operations in order to conserve cash until such time, if ever, that sufficient proceeds from\noperations are generated, and could result in us not being in a position to advance our commercialization strategy or take\nadvantage of business opportunities.\nCash Flows\nOur approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we always have sufficient liquidity to meet our\nliabilities as they come due. We regularly perform cash flow forecasts to ensure that we have sufficient cash to meet our\noperational needs while maintaining sufficient liquidity. At this time, we do not use any derivative financial instruments to\nhedge our currency risk.\nThe following table summarizes KWESST’s consolidated statements of cash flows for the respective periods:\nYear ended Nine months ended\nQuarter ended September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2021 2020 2021 2020\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited)\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ ( 1,536,984) $ 1 8,286 $ ( 6,255,213) $ ( 1,791,654)\nInvesting activities ( 773,283) (25,554) (1,073,192) (390,972)\nFinancing acitivities 2,566,246 1 ,787,455 6,942,750 5 ,234,771\nNet cash inflows (outflows) $ 2 55,979 $ 1 ,780,187 $ ( 385,655) $ 3 ,052,145\nCash, beginning of period 2,432,126 1,293,573 3,073,760 21,615\nCash, end of period $ 2,688,105 $ 3,073,760 $ 2,688,105 $ 3,073,760\n14 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nCash used by operating activities\nWith the additional capital raised during Fiscal 2021, we continued to invest significantly across the organization and product\ndevelopment. As an early-stage company with various products in the pipeline (pre-commercialization phase), our revenue\nremains low and insufficient to cover the increase in our overhead costs, professional fees, advertising and promotion costs,\nand R&D costs. As a result, cash flow used in operating activities was $1.5 million and $6.3 million for Q4 and Fiscal 2021,\nrespectively, compared to $0.02 million and $1.8 million for Q4 and Fiscal 2020.\nCash used by investing activities\nCash flow used in investing activities for Fiscal 2021 was higher than for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, mainly\ndue significant investment made in sales demonstration units for TASCS IFM, and to a lesser extent to a $0.15 million deposit\nmade to DEFSEC as an advance on future royalties. The $0.4 million investment in Fiscal 2020 includes investments in\ncapitalized developments projects and the cash consideration for the acquisition of the PhantomTM system from SageGuild.\nCash flow used in investing activities for Q4 Fiscal 2021 was higher than the comparable prior period mainly due to our\nsignificant investment made in sales demonstration units for TASCS IFM.\nCash provided by financing activities\nThe $1.7 million increase in cash provided by financing activities in Fiscal 2021 over Fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by\n$1.8 million of proceeds from exercised of stock options and warrants over the comparable period in light of the favorable\nmovement in the price of the Common Shares since going public in Canada. In Fiscal 2021, we raised net proceeds of $5.4\nmillion from equity offerings, slightly ahead of the $5.3 million raised in the prior period. We also repaid $0.2 million of\nrelated party loans during Fiscal 2021, compared to $0.08 million in the prior period (see section “Related Party\nTransactions”). In Q4 Fiscal 2021, we generated $0.8 million additional cash compared to Q4 Fiscal 2020 due to exercise of\noptions and warrants.\nCapital Management\nOur objective in managing its capital is to safeguard KWESST’s ability to continue as a going concern and to sustain future\ndevelopment of the business. KWESST senior management is responsible for managing the capital through regular review\nof financial information to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet operating requirements and investments to support\nits growth strategy. The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing this process. From time to time, we could issue new\ncommon shares or debt to maintain or adjust its capital structure. We are not subject to any externally imposed capital\nrequirements.\nKWESST’s capital is composed of the following:\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2021 2020\nDebt:\nLease obligations $ 307,909 $ 352,037\nRelated party loans - 218,276\nBorrowings 53,251 32,273\nEquity:\nShare capital 17,215,068 9,374,563\nWarrants 1,848,389 277,170\nContributed surplus 2,458,211 306,708\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (8,991) -\nAccumulated deficit (15,388,949) (6,073,577)\nTotal capital $ 6,484,888 $ 4,487,450\n15 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nDebt\nThe following table shows our total indebtedness:\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2021 2020\nCEBA term loan $ 5 3,251 $ 3 2,273\nRelated party loans - 2 18,276\nLease liabilities 3 07,909 3 52,037\nTotal debt $ 3 61,160 $ 602,586\nCEBA Term Loan\nIn April 2020, we entered into a $40,000 term loan agreement with TD Canada Trust under the Canada Emergency Business\nAccount program administered by the Federal Government of Canada. In December 2020, the Canadian Federal Government\namended the CEBA Term Loan program to increase it to $60,000. Accordingly, our indebtedness increased to $60,000.\nThis amendment also resulted in extending the interest-free period on the CEBA Term Loan to December 31, 2022.\nThereafter, we may exercise the option for a three (3) year term extension, subject to a 5% annual interest rate during the\nextension period. As an inducement for early repayment, if we repay the CEBA Term Loan by December 31, 2022, $20,000\nwill be forgiven.\nRelated Party Loans\nSee section “Related Party Transactions”.\nLease Liabilities\nThe reduction in lease liabilities since September 30, 2020, is due to lease payments during Fiscal 2021 offset partially by\nthe accretion costs. Lease liabilities are recorded at the discounted amount of future payments under leases for right-of-use\nassets.\nContractual Obligations\nAt September 30, 2021, our contractual obligations and commitments were as follows:\nPayment due: Total Within 1 Year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years\nMinimum royalty commitments $ 2,500,000 $ - $ 150,000 $ 2,350,000\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 1,127,202 1,127,202 - -\nLease obligations 390,000 62,400 187,200 140,400\nOther commitments 101,928 101,928 - -\nBorrowings 60,000 - 60,000 -\nTotal contractual obligations $ 4,179,130 $ 1,291,530 $ 397,200 $ 2,490,400\nThe above table does not include the contingent minimum annual royalty payments (total of $1.55 million over five years)\nthat will be due to AerialX for its licensed technology (see Note 26(a) of Fiscal 2021 FS) as this is triggered only upon\nmeeting certain technical milestones, which have not been met as of the date of this MD&A.\n16 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nEquity\nFor Fiscal 2021, we raised gross proceeds of $6.0 million from closing the April 2021 Private Placement and September 2021\nPrivate Placement (together, the “2021 Financings”). The total share offering costs (cash and non-cash) were $0.8 million.\nFor Fiscal 2020, we raised gross proceeds of $5.7 million primarily from equity and convertible note offerings. The total\noffering costs (cash and non-cash) were $0.7 million.\nRefer to Note 16 of Fiscal 2021 FS, for further details on the above equity offerings.\nUse of Proceeds from Financings\nThe following table shows the net proceeds from the 2021 Financings plus the remaining working capital on April 29, 2021\n(immediately after closing the April 2021 Private Placement) available to fund future working capital, product development,\nrepayment loans and other investments:\nAvailable Funds\nNet proceeds from April 2021 Private Placement $ 4,009,223\nWorking capital on April 29, 2021 235,345\n4,244,568\nNet proceeds from September 2021 Private Placement 1,459,270\nProforma available funds from April 29, 2021 $ 5,703,838\nThe following table provides an approximate breakdown of the funds we spent from the proceeds raised in September 2020\nplus the working capital available at that time, coupled with the above 2021 available funds:\n2020 Financing 2021 Financing\nEstimated and Estimated and\nUnaudited Actual Unaudited Actual\nExpected Use of Funds from Proceeds Expected Use of Funds from Proceeds Unspent\nAllocation of Net September 1, 2020 Unspent as at Allocation of April 29, 2021 to as at\nUse of Proceeds (1) Proceeds (2) to Apr 28, 2021 April 28, 2021 Net Proceeds September 30 2021 September 30, 2021\nProducts development: (3)\nTASCS NORS (formerly TASCS Sniper) $ 1 50,000 $ 15,210 $ 134,790 $ - $ - $ -\nTASCS IFM (4) 1 50,000 623,953 (473,953) 400,000 255,384 144,616\nBLDS 5 75,000 74,874 500,126 200,000 45,709 154,291\nShot Counter 1 20,000 - 120,000 - - -\nPhantom 1 50,000 134,743 15,257 500,000 208,966 291,034\nGreyGhost 2 50,000 91,284 158,716 200,000 15,840 184,160\nATAK - - - 500,000 221,321 278,679\nLEC - - - 500,000 153,471 346,529\nTotal products development 1 ,395,000 940,064 454,936 2,300,000 900,691 1,399,309\nOther specific allocations:\nCosts related to complete QT 1 50,000 145,560 4,440 - - -\nBroker commissions and fees relating to QT 1 89,520 189,520 - - - -\nRepayment of CEO and employee loans 1 14,049 31,252 82,797 191,600 191,600 -\nRepayment of unsecured borrowings - - - 310,527 310,527 -\nMarketing costs 3 45,000 832,852 (487,852) - - -\nPrepaid royalties to DEFSEC (5) 1 50,000 - 150,000 150,000 150,000 -\nTotal allocated proceeds 2 ,343,569 2,139,248 204,321 2,952,127 1,552,818 1,399,309\nUnallocated proceeds for working capital 1 ,746,237 1,715,213 31,024 2,516,366 1,019,468 1,496,898\nTransferred to 2021 Financing for working capital - 235,345 (235,345) 235,345 235,345 -\nTotal use of proceeds $ 4 ,089,806 $ 4,089,806 $ - $ 5,703,838 $ 2,807,631 $2,896,207\nNotes:\n(1) Excludes non-cash transactions settled in Common Shares.\n17 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\n(2) As disclosed in our Filing Statement dated August 28, 2020, as filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com).\n(3) Includes concept & design, initial prototype, market testing, and pre-production including a few demo units.

These trials\nprovided us with constructive feedback for further enhancements to the TASCS IFM mortar system in advance of the\nextensive United States military exercises that took place in September and October 2021, which were also successful based\non positive feedback received from the United States military customer. We also reallocated some of the funds to marketing\nto further promote and increase awareness about KWESST and our product offerings. At April 28, 2021 (immediately prior\nto the closing of the April 2021 Private Placement) we had $235,345 remaining proceeds from the September 2020 Private\nPlacement, which we have allocated to the 2021 Financings table as part of the unallocated working capital. Going forward,\nwe will report only on the remaining funds from the 2021 Financings.\nWhile management intends to invest the remaining available funds as shown under the 2021 Financings in the above table;\nthere may be circumstances where, for sound business reasons, a reallocation of funds may be advisable.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our results\nof operations, financial condition, revenues or expenses, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nFor Fiscal 2021 and nine months ended September 30, 2020, we had the following related party transactions:\nDEFSEC Purchase Agreement\nThe entering into the DEFSEC Purchase Agreement by us was considered to be a “related-party transaction” for purposes of\nMultilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”) and Policy\n5.9 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions of the TSXV. We relied on exemptions from the formal\nvaluation and minority shareholder approval requirements available under MI 61-101. We were exempt from the formal\nvaluation requirement in section 5.4 of MI 61-101 in reliance on sections 5.5(a) and (b) of MI 61-101 as the fair market value\nof the transaction was not more than the 25% of our market capitalization, and no securities of ours were listed or quoted for\ntrading on prescribed stock exchanges or stock markets. Additionally, we were exempt from minority shareholder approval\nrequirement in section 5.6 of MI 61-101 in reliance on section 5.7(a) as the fair market value of the transaction was not more\nthan the 25% of our market capitalization. The transaction was reviewed and approved by our independent directors and we\nobtained approval from over 51% of disinterested shareholders. Further, on February 19, 2021, the TSXV conditionally\napproved this asset acquisition. We closed the LEC Technology acquisition shortly after closing the April 2021 Private\nPlacement.\nEmployment and Consulting Agreements\nWe have entered into employment and consulting agreements with key management. Refer to Note 11 of Fiscal 2021 FS\nfor total compensation paid to key management.\nVoting Agreement\nOn September 14, 2020, we entered into a voting agreement with Messrs. Luxton and MacLeod, pursuant to which Messrs.\nLuxton and MacLeod agreed to vote the voting securities of the Company they own and exercise voting control over to ensure\nthat the following individuals are members of our Board of Directors: Mr. Luxton, Mr. MacLeod, one person nominated by\nMr. Luxton who is from the capital markets industry, one independent person nominated by Mr. Luxton and one independent\n18 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nperson nominated by Mr. MacLeod. Further, Messrs. Luxton and MacLeod irrevocably appointed our President as their proxy\nand granted our President power of attorney to vote their voting securities in a manner described in the voting agreement\nshould either Mr. Luxton or Mr. MacLeod fail to vote or attempt to vote in a manner inconsistent with the voting agreement.\nThe voting agreement will automatically terminate the day immediately following our next annual general meeting of\nshareholders.\nRelated Party Loans\nDuring Fiscal 2021, we repaid all prior related party loans for source of new equity financing. Refer to Note 11 of Fiscal\n2021 FS for tabular disclosure showing the activities during the fiscal year.\nOther Related Party Transactions\nIn January 2021, the CEO of SageGuild became the acting CEO and director for our United States subsidiary, KWESST\nU.S., which was incorporated in January 2021 to have a physical presence in the United States to facilitate our business\ndevelopment and commercial activities. We previously entered into a consulting agreement with SageGuild in March 2020\nto provide business development services in the United States. This consulting agreement, including compensation, was not\nmodified as a result of the above. At the time, SageGuild was not a related party and the terms of this consulting agreement\nwere negotiated at arm’s length. From January 1, 2021, to September 30, 2021, the total compensation (cash and share-based)\namounted to $339,309.\nFor other immaterial related party transactions, refer to Note 11 of Fiscal 2021 FS.\nTerms and conditions of transactions with related parties\nTransactions with related parties are conducted on terms pursuant to an agreement and approved by the Board of Directors\nof KWESST.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS\nWe recognize financial assets and liabilities when we become party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. On initial\nrecognition, financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the financial\nassets and liabilities, except for financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, whereby the transactions\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nRefer to Note 22 of Fiscal 2021 FS for comprehensive disclosure on our financial instruments.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe following is a summary of critical accounting policies, requiring management to make significant estimates and\nassumptions:\nRevenue\nHistorically, revenue recognition did not require significant management judgement as delivery of performance obligations\nunder contracts with customers was done generally within the same quarter. However, with the USD $0.8 million contract\nawarded to us from the U.S. military customer during the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 with delivery of performance obligations\nover several quarters, we have revised our accounting policy to address this as follows:\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of products or services to customers at an amount that reflects the transaction\nprice we expect to receive in exchange for the products or services. Our contracts with customers may include the delivery\nof multiple products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance\n19 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nobligations. The accounting for a contract or contracts with a customer that contain multiple performance obligations requires\nus to allocate the contract or contracts transaction price to the identified distinct performance obligations.\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized, for each performance obligation, either over a period of time or at a\npoint in time, depending on which method reflects the transfer of control of the goods or services underlying the particular\nobligation to the customer.\nFor performance obligations satisfied over time, we recognize revenue over time using an input method, based on costs\nincurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion, to measure progress toward satisfying such performance\nobligation (for non-recurring engineering services, the input method is based on hours). Under this method, costs that do not\ncontribute to our performance in transferring control of goods or services to the customer are excluded from the measurement\nof progress toward satisfying the performance obligation. In certain other situations, we might recognize revenue at a point\nin time, when the criteria to recognize revenue over time are not met. In any event, when the total anticipated costs exceed\nthe total anticipated revenues on a contract, such loss is recognized in its entirety in the period it becomes known. For the\ncontract awarded in Fiscal 2021, we recognized revenue over time based on estimated hours to deliver the performance\nobligations under the contract. At September 30, 2021, we have estimated the percentage of completion at 98.3% based on\nour estimate of the remaining hours to complete our performance obligations under the contract, with the remaining to be\nrecognized during the first quarter of Fiscal 2021.\nWe may enter into contractual arrangements with a customer to deliver services on one project with respect to more than one\nperformance obligation, such as non-recurring engineering, procurement, and training. When entering into such\narrangements, we allocate the transaction price by reference to the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation.\nAccordingly, when such arrangements exist on the same project, the value of each performance obligation is based on its\nstand-alone price and recognized according to the respective revenue recognition methods described above.\nWe account for a contract modification, which consists of a change in the scope or price (or both) of a contract, as a separate\ncontract when the remaining goods or services to be delivered after the modification are distinct from those delivered prior\nto the modification and the price of the contract increases by an amount of consideration that reflects our stand-alone selling\nprice of the additional promised goods or services. When the contract modification is not accounted for as a separate contract,\nwe recognize an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis at the date of contract modification. There was no\ncontract modification in Fiscal 2021.\nThe timing of revenue recognition often differs from performance payment schedules, resulting in revenue that has been\nearned but not billed. These amounts are included in unbilled receivables. At September 30, 2021, we had $0.3 million of\nunbilled receivable, of which $0.15 million was invoiced during the first week of October 2021 and the remaining balance to\nbe invoiced in November 2021 in accordance with the customer payment schedule. Amounts billed in accordance with\ncustomer contracts, but not yet earned, are recorded and presented as part of contract liabilities. There was no outstanding\ncontract liability at September 30, 2021.\nWhen a contract includes a significant financing component, the value of such component is excluded from the transaction\nprice and is recognized separately as finance income or expense, as applicable.\nAccounting for acquisitions and contingent consideration\nDuring Fiscal 2021 and 2020, we acquired technology assets, which were recorded at fair value. Refer Note 4 of the audited\nconsolidated financial statements of Fiscal 2021 for further details.\nAreas of significant estimation in connection with the acquisition of the LEC System included:\n• the determination of the discount rate for the present value of the minimum annual royalty payments to DEFSEC;\nand\n• the volatility assumption used in the Black Scholes option model to estimate the fair value of the warrants issued to\nDEFSEC given our short history as a public company (see below – Accounting for share-based compensation).\n20 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nAreas of significant estimation in connection with the acquisition of the PhantomTM included:\n• the fair value of our Common Shares and warrants issued to SageGuild because we were a private company at the\ntime of the asset acquisition; and\n• the accounting for the contingent annual payments.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nWe review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount\nmay not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The\nrecoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessing\nimpairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, referred as the cash\ngenerating unit (“CGU”).\nIn accordance with IFRS, if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a long-lived asset is less than the\ncarrying value of that asset, then we recognize an asset impairment charge. The impairment charge is determined based on\nthe excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value, which generally represents the discounted future cash flows from\nthat asset.\nBecause we are an early-stage defense technology company, management exercises significant judgment in establishing key\nassumptions and estimates to determine the recoverable amount of our CGU, including future cash flows based on historical\nand budgeting operating results, growth rates, tax rates, and appropriate after-tax discount rates. The actual results may vary\nand may cause significant adjustments in future periods.\nImpairment of non-financial assets\nWe review non-financial assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of\nthe assets may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the respective non-financial asset is less than our carrying amount,\nit is considered to be impaired. Management exercises significant judgement in estimating the recoverable amount for non-\nfinancial assets (see Impairment of long-lived assets).\nAccounting for share-based compensation\nWe measure share-based compensation at fair value. A key input in the Black Scholes option model is the volatility\nassumption in our Common Shares. Due to our limited trading history, management has established a relevant peer group of\nlisted companies and selected the weighted average of their volatilities over a period of three to five years, where available.\nStarting in Fiscal 2021, we have commenced to incorporate a percentage of our stock volatility in the overall calculation of\nthe volatility assumption. We expect to solely rely on our stock volatility by the end of Fiscal 2023 to estimate the fair value\nof share-based compensation as well as for warrants.\n21 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nOUTSTANDING SHARE INFORMATION\nAt September 30, 2021, our authorized capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares with no stated par value.\nThe following table shows the outstanding common shares and dilutive securities at September 30, 2021:\nSeptember 30, Proceeds if Average\n2021 Exercised price\nCommon shares 48,695,631\nFounders' warrants 8,500,000 $ 1 ,700,000 $ 0.20\nBroker warrants 336,983 $ 4 17,607 $ 1.24\nWarrants 4,868,542 $ 8 ,163,150 $ 1.68\nStock options 4,167,516 $ 5 ,709,497 $ 1.37\nRestricted stock units (RSUs) 1,189,072 $ - $ -\nPerformance stock units (PSUs) 200,000 $ - $ -\nStock appreciation rights (SARs) 24,365 $ - $ -\nAgents' compensation options:\nCommon shares 58,616 $ 7 3,270 $ 1.25\nWarrants 196,115 $ 3 43,201 $ 1.75\nTotal dilutive securities 68,236,840 $ 1 6,406,724\nNo material changes in outstanding shares have occurred since September 30, 2021.\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL\nREPORTING\nDisclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) are intended to provide reasonable assurance that material information is\ngathered and reported to senior management to permit timely decisions regarding public disclosure.

These include widespread risks associated with any form of business and specific risks associated with\nour business and our involvement in the defense technology industry.\nThis section describes risk factors identified as being potentially significant to us. In addition, other risks and uncertainties\nnot discussed to date or not known to management could have material and adverse effects on the existing business activities,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, plans and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe are an early-stage company.\nWe are an early-stage company and as such, we are subject to many risks including under-capitalization, cash shortages, and\nlimitations with respect to personnel, financial and other resources and the lack of revenue. There is no assurance that we will\nbe successful in achieving a return on shareholders’ investment and the likelihood of success must be considered in light of\nour early stage of operations. Our prospects must be considered speculative in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties\nfrequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operations, particularly in the highly competitive and rapidly\nevolving markets in which we operate. To attempt to address these risks, we must, among other things, successfully\nimplement our business plan, marketing, and commercialization strategies, respond to competitive developments, and attract,\nretain, and motivate qualified personnel. A substantial risk is involved in investing in us because, as a smaller commercial\nenterprise that has fewer resources than an established company, our management may be more likely to make mistakes, and\nwe may be more vulnerable operationally and financially to any mistakes that may be made, as well as to external factors\nbeyond our control.\nWe currently have negative operating cash flows.\nSince inception, we have generated significant negative cash flow from operations, financed in great part through equity\nfinancing. There can be no certainty that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flow from our operating\nactivities. In addition, our working capital and funding needs may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors\nincluding, but not limited to:\n• progress of our manufacturing, licensing, and distribution activities;\n• collaborative license agreements with third parties;\n• opportunities to license-in beneficial technologies or potential acquisitions;\n• potential milestone or other payments that we may make to licensors or corporate partners;\n• technological and market consumption and distribution models or alternative forms of proprietary technology for\ngame-changing applications in the military and homeland security market that affect our potential revenue levels or\ncompetitive position in the marketplace;\n• the level of sales and gross profit;\n• costs associated with production, labor, and services costs, and our ability to realize operation and production\nefficiencies;\n• fluctuations in certain working capital items, including product inventory, short-term loans, and accounts receivable,\nthat may be necessary to support the growth of our business; and\n• expenses associated with litigation.\nWhile we expect to become profitable in 12-24 months from the date of this Registration Statement, there is no guarantee\nthat it will happen, and we may never become profitable. To date, we have generated limited revenues and a large portion of\nour expenses are fixed, including expenses related to facilities, equipment, contractual commitments and personnel. With the\nanticipated commercialization for certain of our product offerings during Fiscal 2022, we expect our net losses from\n23 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\noperations will improve. Our ability to generate additional revenues and potential to become profitable will depend largely\non the timely productization of our products, coupled with securing timely, cost-effective outsourced manufacturing\narrangements and marketing our products. There can be no assurance that any such events will occur or that we will ever\nbecome profitable. Even if we achieve profitability, we cannot predict the level of such profitability. If we sustain losses over\nan extended period of time, we may be unable to continue our business.\nThe coronavirus may adversely impact our business.\nAs of the date of this Registration Statement, markets, governments and health organizations around the world are working\nto contain the outbreak of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”). COVID-19 may present a wide range of potential issues or\ndisruptions in our business and the business of third parties who we depend on or might depend in the future for materials\nand manufacturing, most of which we are not able to know the full extent of at the time of this Registration Statement. These\ndisruptions could include disruptions of our ability to receive timely materials, manufacture our products, or distribute our\nproducts, as well as closures of our primary facility in Kanata, Ontario or the facilities of our suppliers, manufacturers, and\ncustomers. Any disruption of the business of our suppliers, manufacturers, or customers would likely impact our sales and\noperating results. Additionally, a significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases (including COVID-19)\ncould result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries,\nresulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products. Any of these events could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWhile COVID-19 has not had a material impact to our business to date, the following is a summary of what we believe may\nimpact our future business given the persistency of COVID-19: disruptions to business operations resulting from quarantines\nof employees, customers, manufacturers and other third-party service providers in areas affected by the outbreak; disruptions\nto business operations resulting from travel restrictions, including travel to industry tradeshows; and uncertainty around the\nduration of the virus' impact.\nDespite the global vaccination efforts underway, the extent to which COVID-19 could impact our operations, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and cash flows is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Negative financial results,\nuncertainties in the market, and a tightening of credit markets, caused by COVID-19, or a recession, could have a material\nadverse effect on our liquidity and ability to obtain financing in the future.\nMoreover, if a pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease, including COVID-19, or other public health crisis\nwere to affect our facilities, staff, auditors, or advisors, our business could be adversely and materially affected. Such a\npandemic could result in mandatory social distancing, travel bans, and quarantine restrictions, and this may limit access to\nour employees and professional advisors, and consequently may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations\nwith regulatory authorities.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our business plan.\nThe execution of our business plan poses many challenges and is based on a number of assumptions. We may not be able to\nsuccessfully execute our business plan. If we experience significant cost overruns, or if our business plan is more costly than\nwe anticipate, certain activities may be delayed or eliminated, resulting in changes or delays to our current plans. Also, we\nmay be compelled to secure additional funding (which may or may not be available or available at conditions unfavorable to\nus) to execute our business plan. We cannot predict with certainty our future revenues or results from our operations. If the\nassumptions on which our revenues or expenditures forecasts are based change, the benefits of our business plan may change\nas well. In addition, we may consider expanding our business beyond what is currently contemplated in our business plan.\nDepending on the financing requirements of a potential business expansion, we may be required to raise additional capital\nthrough the issuance of equity or debt. If we are unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, we may be unable to\npursue a potential business expansion.\n24 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nA significant portion of our revenues are non-recurring.\nA significant portion of our revenue for Fiscal 2021 was prior to commercial production of TASCS IFM and considered to\nbe non-recurring. While we expect to reach commercialization stage for certain product offerings during Fiscal 2022, there\nis no assurance we will succeed.\nWith the completion of the LEC System technology acquisition in April 2021, we expect to launch the commercialization of\nour non-lethal LEC devices starting in the second quarter of Fiscal 2022 which we anticipate will drive significant product\nrevenue on a monthly basis with the use of an e-commerce platform. However, there is no assurance that we will successfully\ncomplete timely the productization of our initial non-lethal devices and obtain market acceptance of our products. Further,\nwhile we believe the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (“ATF”) classification of our non-lethal\ncartridge-based LEC devices will not be classified now or in the future as “firearms”, there is no assurance that we will\nprevail. We are in the process of applying for the ATF classification. In the event these are classified as “firearms”, the\ncommercialization and related sales will be subject to firearm regulations with United States federal and state laws which\nmay delay materially the timing for generating sales.\nThere is uncertainty with respect to our revenue growth.\nThere can be no assurance that we can generate substantial revenue growth, or that any revenue growth that is achieved can\nbe sustained. Revenue growth that we have achieved or may achieve may not be indicative of future operating results. In\naddition, we may further increase our operating expenses in order to fund higher levels of research and development, increase\nour sales and marketing efforts and increase our administrative resources in anticipation of future growth. To the extent that\nincreases in such expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by increased revenues, our business, operating results\nand financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to fully develop our products, which could prevent us from ever becoming profitable.\nIf we experience difficulties in the development process, such as capacity constraints, quality control problems or other\ndisruptions, we may not be able to fully develop market-ready commercial products at acceptable costs, which would\nadversely affect our ability to effectively enter the market. A failure by us to achieve a low-cost structure through economies\nof scale or improvements in manufacturing processes would have a material adverse effect on our commercialization plans\nand our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may experience delays in product sales due to marketing and distribution capabilities.\nIn order to successfully commercialize our products, we must continue to develop our internal marketing and sales force with\ntechnical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities or arrange for third parties to perform these services. In order\nto successfully commercialize any of our products, we must have an experienced sales and distribution infrastructure. The\ncontinued development of our sales and distribution infrastructure will require substantial resources, which may divert the\nattention of our management and key personnel and defer our product development and commercialization efforts. To the\nextent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies, our revenues will depend on the efforts of\nothers. For example, on September 24, 2021, we entered into an agreement with STRYK Group USA for the\ncommercialization of our LEC’s non-lethal products in the United States, which these efforts may not be successful.\nAdditionally, in marketing our products, we would likely compete with companies that currently have extensive and well-\nfunded marketing and sales operations. Despite marketing and sales efforts, we may be unable to compete successfully against\nthese companies. We may not be able to do so on favorable terms.\nIn the event we fail to develop substantial sales, marketing and distribution channels, or to enter into arrangements with third\nparties for those purposes, we will experience delays in product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on prospects,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThere is no assurance that our products will be accepted in the marketplace or that ae will turn a profit or generate\nimmediate revenues.\n25 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nThere is no assurance as to whether our products will be accepted in the marketplace. While we believe our products address\ncustomer needs, the acceptance of our products may be delayed or not materialize. We have incurred and anticipate incurring\nsubstantial expenses relating to the development of our products, the marketing of our products and initial operations of our\nbusiness. Our revenues and possible profits will depend upon, among other things, our ability to successfully market our\nproducts to customers. There is no assurance that revenues and profits will be generated.\nStrategic alliances may not be achieved or achieve their goals.\nTo achieve a scalable operating model with minimal capital expenditures, we plan to rely upon strategic alliances with original\nequipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) for the manufacturing and distribution of our products. There can be no assurance that\nsuch strategic alliances can be achieved or will achieve their goals.\nWe may depend on key suppliers.\nWe may be able to purchase certain key components of our products from a limited number of suppliers. Failure of a supplier\nto provide sufficient quantities on favorable terms or on a timely basis could result in possible lost sales or uncompetitive\nproduct pricing. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact the supply chain relating to these components.\nWe may incur higher costs or unavailability of components, materials and accessories.\nAs we expect to commercialize certain of our product lines in Fiscal 2022, we may depend on certain domestic and\ninternational suppliers for the delivery of components and materials used in the assembly of our products and certain\naccessories including ammunition, used with our products. Further, any reliance on third-party suppliers may create risks\nrelated to our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components or materials and reduced control over pricing\nand timing of delivery of components and materials. We currently have no long-term agreements with any of our suppliers\nand there is no guarantee the supply will not be interrupted.\nIn light of the current global supply chain challenges caused by COVID-19, components used in the manufacture of our\nproducts may be delayed, become unavailable or discontinued. Any delays may take weeks or months to resolve. Further,\nparts obsolescence may require us to redesign our product to ensure quality replacement components. These delays could\ncause significant delays in manufacturing and loss of sales, leading to adverse effects significantly impacting our financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, our shipping costs and the timely delivery of our products could be adversely impacted by a number of\nfactors which could reduce the profitability of our operations, including: higher fuel costs, potential port closures,\ncustoms clearance issues, increased government regulation or changes for imports of foreign products into Canada,\ndelays created by terrorist attacks or threats, public health issues and pandemics and epidemics, national disasters or work\nstoppages, and other matters. Any interruption of supply for any material components of our products could significantly\ndelay the shipment of our products and have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability, and financial\ncondition.\nWe rely upon a limited number of third parties for shipping, transportation, logistics, marketing and sales of our products.\nWe rely on third parties to ship, transport, and provide logistics for our products. Further, we plan on relying on third parties\nto market and sell our LEC System products. Our dependence on a limited number of third parties for these services leaves\nus vulnerable due to our need to secure these parties’ services on favorable terms. Loss of, or an adverse effect on, any of\nthese relationships or failure of any of these third parties to perform as expected could have a material and adverse effect on\nour business, sales, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation.\nWe may be subject to product liability proceedings or claims.\nWe may be subject to proceedings or claims that may arise in the ordinary conduct of the business, which could include\nproduct and service warranty claims, which could be substantial. Product liability for us is a major risk as some of our products\n26 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nwill be used by military personnel in theaters-of-war (for the Tactical and Counter Threat product offerings) and by consumers\nand law enforcement (for the non-lethal devices). The occurrence of product defects due to non-compliance of our\nmanufacturing specifications and the inability to correct errors could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our\nproducts, material warranty expense, diversion of technological and other resources from our product development efforts,\nand the loss of credibility with customers, manufacturers’ representatives, distributors, value-added resellers, systems\nintegrators, original equipment manufacturers and end-users, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results and financial conditions. To mitigate product liability risk, our products will be sold with a liability\ndisclaimer for misuse of the product.\nIf we are unable to successfully design and develop or acquire new products, our business may be harmed.\nTo maintain and increase sales we must continue to introduce new products and improve or enhance our existing products or\nnew products. The success of our new and enhanced products depends on many factors, including anticipating consumer\npreferences, finding innovative solutions to consumer problems or acquiring new solutions through mergers and acquisitions,\ndifferentiating our products from those of our competitors, and maintaining the strength of our brand. The design and\ndevelopment of our products as well as acquisitions of other businesses.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products or our results of operations.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we forecast inventory needs and often place orders with our manufacturers before we\nreceive firm orders from our retail partners or customers. If we fail to accurately forecast demand, we may experience excess\ninventory levels or a shortage of product.\nIf we underestimate the demand for our products, we or our suppliers may not be able to scale to meet our demand, and this\ncould result in delays in the shipment of our products and our failure to satisfy demand, as well as damage to our reputation\nand retail partner relationships. If we overestimate the demand for our products, we could face inventory levels in excess of\ndemand, which could result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices,\nwhich would harm our gross margins. In addition, failures to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could\ncause a decline in sales and harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we may not be able to accurately forecast our results of operations and growth rate. Forecasts may be particularly\nchallenging as we expand into new markets and geographies and develop and market new products for which we have no or\nlimited historical data. Our historical sales, expense levels, and profitability may not be an appropriate basis for forecasting\nfuture results. Our lack of historical data related to new products makes it particularly difficult to make forecasts related to\nsuch products. The lead times and reliability of our suppliers has been inconsistent as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic\nand may be affected by global events in the future. These effects are expected to last through the remainder of the pandemic.\nPandemic related variances require a very quick pivot and adjustments to the supply chain, production and marketing. If we\nare unable to make these changes quickly or at all our inventory, production and sales may be materially affected.\nFailure to accurately forecast our results of operations and growth rate could cause us to make poor operating decisions that\nwe may not be able to correct in a timely manner. Consequently, actual results could be materially different than anticipated.\nEven if the markets in which we compete expand, we cannot assure you that our business will grow at similar rates, if at all.\nUndetected flaws may be discovered in our products.\nThere can be no assurance that, despite testing by us, flaws will not be found in our products and services, resulting in loss\nof, or delay in, market acceptance. We may be unable, for technological or other reasons, to introduce products and services\nin a timely manner or at all in response to changing customer requirements. In addition, there can be no assurance that while\nwe are attempting to finish the development of our technologies, products and services, a competitor will not introduce similar\nor superior technologies, products and services, thus diminishing our advantage, rendering our technologies, products and\nservices partially or wholly obsolete, or at least requiring substantial re-engineering in order to become commercially\nacceptable. Failure by us to maintain technology, product and service introduction schedules, avoid cost overruns and\nundetected errors, or introduce technologies, products and services that are superior to competing technologies, products and\nservices would have a materially adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\n27 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nWe will be reliant on information technology systems and may be subject to damaging cyber-attacks.\nWe use third parties for certain hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology (“IT”) services in\nconnection with our operations. Our operations depend, in part, on how well we and our suppliers protect networks,\nequipment, IT systems and software against damage from a number of threats, including, but not limited to, cable cuts,\ndamage to physical plants, natural disasters, intentional damage and destruction, fire, power loss, hacking, computer viruses,\nvandalism and theft. Our operations also depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks,\nequipment, IT systems and software, as well as pre-emptive expenses to mitigate the risks of failures. Any of these and other\nevents could result in information system failures, delays and/or increase in capital expenses. The failure of information\nsystems or a component of information systems could, depending on the nature of any such failure, adversely impact our\nreputation and results of operations. Moreover, failure to meet the minimum cybersecurity requirements for defense contracts\nmay disqualify us from participating in the tendering process. To date, we have not experienced any losses relating to cyber-\nattacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not incur such losses in the future.\nOur risk and exposure to these matters cannot be fully mitigated because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these\nthreats. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of controls, processes and practices\ndesigned to protect systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access is a priority.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance\nprotective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nIn certain circumstances, our reputation could be damaged.\nDamage to our reputation can be the result of the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, and could include\nany negative publicity, whether true or not. Reputational risk for us is a major risk as some of our products will be used by\nmilitary personnel in theaters-of-war. The increased usage of social media and other web-based tools used to generate, publish\nand discuss user-generated content and to connect with other users has made it increasingly easier for individuals and groups\nto communicate and share opinions and views regarding us and our activities, whether true or not. Although we believe that\nwe operate in a manner that is respectful to all stakeholders and that we take care in protecting our image and reputation, we\ndo not ultimately have direct control over how we are perceived by others. Reputational loss may result in decreased investor\nconfidence, increased challenges in developing and maintaining community relations and an impediment to our overall ability\nto advance our projects, thereby having a material adverse impact on financial performance, financial condition, cash flows\nand growth prospects.\nOur results of operations are difficult to predict and depend on a variety of factors.\nThere is no assurance that the production, technology acquisitions, and the commercialization of proprietary technology for\ngame-changing applications in the security forces and personal defense markets will be managed successfully. Any inability\nto achieve such commercial success could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating\nresults, liquidity, and prospects. In addition, the comparability of results may be affected by changes in accounting guidance\nor changes in our ownership of certain assets. Accordingly, the results of operations from year to year may not be directly\ncomparable to prior reporting periods. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the results of operations may fluctuate\nsignificantly from period to period, and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results for any future period.\nProtecting and defending against intellectual property claims may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete depends, in part, upon successful protection of our intellectual property. While we have some patents\nand trademarks, we also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, which is inherently risky. Going forward, we will\nattempt to protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to our technologies through available copyright and trademark\nlaws, patents and licensing and distribution arrangements with reputable international companies in specific territories and\nmedia for limited durations. Despite these precautions, existing copyright, trademark and patent laws afford only limited\npractical protection in certain countries where we distribute our products. As a result, it may be possible for unauthorized\nthird parties to copy and distribute our products or certain portions or applications of our intended products, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects.\n28 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nLitigation may also be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the\nvalidity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such\nlitigation, infringement or invalidity claims could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects.\nWe face risks from doing business internationally.\nOur commercialization strategies for our products include sales efforts outside Canada and deriving revenues from\ninternational sources. As a result, our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business, many of which are\nbeyond our control.\nThese risks may include:\n• laws and policies affecting trade, investment and taxes, including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of\nfunds and withholding taxes, and changes in these laws;\n• anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that impose strict requirements on\nhow we conduct our foreign operations and changes in these laws and regulations;\n• changes in local regulatory requirements, including restrictions on content and differing cultural tastes and attitudes;\n• international jurisdictions where laws are less protective of intellectual property and varying attitudes towards the\npiracy of intellectual property;\n• financial instability and increased market concentration of buyers in foreign markets;\n• the instability of foreign economies and governments;\n• fluctuating foreign exchange rates;\n• the spread of communicable diseases in such jurisdictions, which may impact business in such jurisdictions; and\n• war and acts of terrorism.\nEvents or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues\nfrom non-Canadian sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results,\nliquidity, and prospects. Protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this\nprotection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities, and damage to our reputation.\nWe maintain information in digital form as necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary\ninformation and personal information regarding our employees.\nData maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering, and theft. We develop and maintain systems to\nprevent this from occurring, but it is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts\nto overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion,\ntampering, and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these acts remain. In addition, we provide\nconfidential information, digital content and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business\nobjectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, monitor\nthe protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk that data systems of these third parties may be compromised.\nIf our data systems or data systems of these third parties are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be\nimpaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and we may lose\nrevenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. A breach of our network security or other theft or misuse of\nconfidential and proprietary information, digital content or personal employee information could subject us to business,\nregulatory, litigation, and reputation risk, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur success depends on management and key personnel.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees. From time to\ntime, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which\ncould disrupt our business. If we are unable to attract and retain top talent, our ability to compete may be harmed. Our success\n29 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nis also highly dependent on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel.\nCompetition for highly skilled executives and other employees is high in our industry, especially from larger and better\ncapitalized defense and security companies. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Failure to\nattract and retain qualified executive officers and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nprospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur directors, officers or members of management may have conflicts of interest.\nCertain of our directors, officers, and other members of management serve (and may in the future serve) as directors, officers,\nand members of management of other companies and therefore, it is possible that a conflict may arise between their duties as\none of our directors, officers or members of management and their duties as a director, officer or member of management of\nsuch other companies. Our directors and officers are aware of the existence of laws governing accountability of directors and\nofficers for corporate opportunity and requiring disclosures by directors of conflicts of interest and we will rely upon such\nlaws in respect of any directors’ and officers’ conflicts of interest or in respect of any breaches of duty by any of our directors\nor officers. All such conflicts will be disclosed by such directors or officers in accordance with the BCBCA and they will\ngovern themselves in respect thereof to the best of their ability in accordance with the obligations imposed upon them by law.\nIt may not be possible for foreign investors to enforce actions against us, and our directors and officers.\nWe are a corporation organized under the laws of the Province of British Columbia and our Canadian subsidiary is organized\nunder the laws of the Province of Ontario and our United States subsidiary is organized under the laws of Delaware. All of\nour directors and executive officers reside principally in Canada. Because all or a substantial portion of our assets and the\nassets of these persons are located in Canada, it may not be possible for foreign investors, including United States investors,\nto effect service of process from outside of Canada upon us or those persons, or to realize in the United States upon judgments\nof United States courts predicted upon civil liabilities under the Exchange Act or other United States laws. Furthermore, it\nmay not be possible to enforce against us foreign judgments obtained in courts outside of Canada based upon the civil liability\nprovisions of the securities laws or other laws in those jurisdictions.\nAny disruption at our places of business could delay revenues or increase our expenses.\nMost of our operations are conducted at locations in the Province of Ontario. We maintain a significant business development\noperation in the United States, through our relationship with SageGuild, LLC. A natural disaster, such as a fire, flood or\nearthquake, could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our offices, and cause us to incur additional\nexpenses.\nIn addition, because we do not maintain “key person” life insurance on any of our executive officers, employees or\nconsultants, any delay in replacing such persons, or an inability to replace them with persons of similar expertise, would have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur internal computer systems are vulnerable to damage and failure.\nDespite the implementation of security measures and backup storage, our internal computer systems are vulnerable to damage\nfrom computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failure.\nAny system failure, accident or security breach that causes interruption in our operations could result in a material disruption\nof our projects. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or applications, or\ninappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, our\ntechnology program may be adversely affected and the further development of our technology may be delayed. We may also\nincur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches.\nBusiness interruptions could adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations are vulnerable to outages and interruptions due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, and\nsimilar events beyond our control. Although we have developed certain plans to respond in the event of a disaster, there can\n30 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nbe no assurance that they will be effective in the event of a specific disaster. Any losses or damages incurred by us could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with possible acquisitions, licensing, business combinations, or joint ventures.\nWhile to date we have mainly focused on developing our own products, from time to time, we could be engaged in discussions\nand activities with respect to possible business and/or technology acquisitions or licensing, sale of assets, business\ncombinations, or joint ventures with the view of either complementing or expanding our internally developed products. These\nacquisitions and licensing activities are not crucial to our long-term business success. The anticipated benefit from any of the\ntransactions we may pursue may not be realized as expected. Regardless of whether any such transaction is consummated,\nthe negotiation of a potential transaction and the integration of the acquired business or technology, acquired or licensed,\ncould incur significant costs and cause diversion of management’s time and resources. Any such transaction could also result\nin impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, development write-offs, and other related expenses. Such transactions may\npose challenges in the consolidation and integration of information technology, accounting systems, personnel, and\noperations. We may have difficulty managing the combined entity in the short term if we experience a significant loss of\nmanagement personnel during the transition period after a significant acquisition. We may also have difficulty managing the\nproduct development and commercialization following a technology acquisition or licensing. No assurance can be given that\nexpansion, licensing or acquisition opportunities will be successful, completed on time, or that we will realize expected\noperating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits. Any of the foregoing could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects.\nClaims against us relating to any acquisition, licensing or business combination may necessitate seeking claims against\nthe seller for which the seller may not indemnify us or that may exceed the seller’s or licensor’s indemnification\nobligations.\nThere may be liabilities assumed in any technology acquisition or licensing or business combination that we did not discover\nor that we underestimated in the course of performing our due diligence. Although a seller or licensor generally will have\nindemnification obligations to us under a licensing, acquisition or merger agreement, these obligations usually will be subject\nto financial limitations, such as general deductibles and maximum recovery amounts, as well as time limitations. There is no\nassurance that our right to indemnification from any seller or licensors will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount,\nscope or duration to fully offset the amount of any undiscovered or underestimated liabilities that we may incur. Any such\nliabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects.\nGrowth may cause pressure on our management and systems.\nOur future growth may cause significant pressure on our management, and our operational, financial, and other resources and\nsystems. Our ability to manage our growth effectively will require that we implement and improve our operational, financial,\nmanufacturing, and management information systems, hire new personnel and then train, manage, and motivate these new\nemployees. These demands may require the hiring of additional management personnel and the development of additional\nexpertise within the existing management team. Any increase in resources devoted to production, business development, and\ndistribution efforts without a corresponding increase in our operational, financial, and management information systems could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may infringe intellectual property rights of third parties.\nFor certain of our product lines, we have elected to protect our technology and products as trade secrets as opposed to seeking\npatent protection. We may, in future, elect to seek patent protection for some of our future products. While we believe that\nour products and other intellectual property do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, our commercial success\ndepends, in part, upon us not infringing intellectual property rights of others. A number of our competitors and other third\nparties have been issued or may have filed patent applications or may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights for\ntechnologies similar to those utilized by us. Some of these patents may grant very broad protection to the owners of the\npatents. While we have engaged external intellectual property legal counsels to undertake an extensive review of existing\nthird-party patents and prepare our patent applications for LEC Systems and Digitization and Counter Threat products, there\nis no assurance that their reviews and conclusion will not prevail if challenged by a third party of an alleged infringement of\n31 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\ntheir intellectual properties. We may become subject to claims by third parties that our technology infringes their intellectual\nproperty rights due to the growth of products in our target markets, the overlap in functionality of those products and the\nprevalence of products. We may become subject to these claims either directly or through indemnities against these claims\nthat we provide to end-users, manufacturer’s representatives, distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators and\noriginal equipment manufacturers. Litigation may be necessary to determine the scope, enforceability and validity of third-\nparty proprietary rights or to establish our proprietary rights. Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated with companies\nhaving, substantially greater resources than we and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual\nproperty litigation to a greater degree and for a longer period of time than us. Regardless of their merit, any such claims could\nbe time consuming to evaluate and defend, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or stoppages, divert\nmanagement’s attention and focus away from the business, subject us to significant liabilities and equitable remedies,\nincluding injunctions, require that we enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements and require that we modify or stop\nusing infringing technology.\nWe may be prohibited from developing or commercializing certain technologies and products unless we obtain a license from\na third party. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms or\nat all. If we do not obtain such a license, we could be required to cease the sale of certain of our products.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States for our Digitization and Counter Threat products.\nOur customers in the United States are global defense contractors and they are subject to various United States government\nregulations which some may be passed on to us in order for them to be compliant. The most significant regulations and\nregulatory authorities that may affect our future business include the following:\n• the Federal Acquisition Regulations and supplemental agency regulations, which comprehensively regulate the\nformation and administration of, and performance under, United States government contracts;\n• the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of all factual cost and pricing data in\nconnection with contract negotiations;\n• the False Claims Act and the False Statements Act, which impose penalties for payments made on the basis of false\nfacts provided to the government and on the basis of false statements made to the government, respectively;\n• the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits United States companies from providing anything of value to a\nforeign official to help obtain, retain or direct business, or obtain any unfair advantage; and\n• laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national\nsecurity purposes or determined to be “controlled unclassified information” and the exportation of certain products\nand technical data.\nOur failure to comply with applicable regulations, rules and approvals; changes in the United States government’s\ninterpretation of such regulations, rules and approvals as have been and are applied to our contracts, proposals or business or\nmisconduct by any of our employees could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the loss of security clearances, a\ndecrease in profitability, or the loss of our subcontract contracts with United States defense contractors generally, any of\nwhich could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA decline in the United States and other government budgets, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, or delays in\ncontract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenue.\nSince inception, most of our revenue was driven by contracts from the United States government, through United States prime\ndefense contractors. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by government spending caps or changes in\ngovernment budgetary priorities, as well by delays in the government budget process, program starts, or the award of contracts\nor orders under existing contracts. As a result, our Digitization and Counter Threat business may be impacted due to shifts in\nthe political environment and changes in the government and agency leadership positions under the new United States\nadministration. If annual budget appropriations or continuing resolutions are not enacted timely, we could face United States\n32 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\ngovernment shutdown, which could adversely impact our business and our ability to receive indirectly timely payment from\nUnited States government entities on future contracts.\nUnited States government contracts are generally not fully funded at inception and contain certain provisions that may\nbe unfavorable to us.\nWe have entered into defense contracts with United States prime defense contractors, which it in turns transact directly with\nthe United States government.\nUnited States government contracts typically involve long lead times for design and development, and are subject to\nsignificant changes in contract scheduling. Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program\nmay continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially, and additional funds are\ncommitted only as Congress makes further appropriations. The termination or reduction of funding for a government program\nwould result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program. In addition, United States government\ncontracts generally contain provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, at the government’s convenience or for\ncontractor default.\nThe actual receipt of revenue on future awards subcontracted to us may never occur or may change because a program\nschedule could change or the program could be cancelled, or a contract could be reduced, modified or terminated early.\nWhile our remaining subcontract with the United States prime defense contractor was fully funded at September 30, 2021,\nwe are exposed to the above risk for future United States government related contracts.\nWe may not be able to comply with changes in government policies and legislation.\nThe manufacture, sale, purchase, possession and use of weapons, ammunitions, firearms, and explosives are subject to federal,\nprovincial and foreign laws. If such regulation becomes more expansive in the future, it could have a material adverse effect\non our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. New legislation, regulations, or changes to or new\ninterpretations of existing regulation could impact our ability to manufacture or sell our products and our projectiles, or limit\ntheir market, which could impact our cost of sales and demand for our products. Similarly changes in laws related to the\ndomestic or international use of chemical irritants by civilians or law enforcement could impact both our cost of sales and the\nsize of our reachable market.\nWe may be subject, both directly and indirectly, to the adverse impact of existing and potential future government regulation\nof our products, technology, operations, and markets. For example, the development, production, exportation, importation,\nand transfer of our products and technology is subject to Canadian and provincial laws. Further, as we plan to conduct business\nin the United States, we will also be subject to United States and foreign export control, sanctions, customs, import and anti-\nboycott laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations (the “EAR”) (collectively, “Trade Control\nLaws”). If one or more of our products or technology, or the parts and components we buy from others, is or become subject\nto the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the “ITAR”) or national security controls under the EAR, this could\nsignificantly impact our operations, for example by severely limiting our ability to sell, export, or otherwise transfer our\nproducts or technology, or to release controlled technology to foreign person employees or others in the United States or\nabroad. We may not be able to retain licenses and other authorizations required under the applicable Trade Control Laws.\nThe failure to satisfy the requirements under the Trade Control Laws, including the failure or inability to obtain necessary\nlicenses or qualify for license exceptions, could delay or prevent the development, production, export, import, and/or in-\ncountry transfer of our products and technology, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nFailure by us, our employees, or others working on our behalf to comply with the applicable government policies and\nregulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including fines, suspension, debarment from bidding\nfor or performing government contracts, or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect\non us.\n33 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nWe will be subject to extensive regulation in the United States for our non-lethal products.\nWe will be subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental, health and safety legislation and other applicable\nregulations, laws and measures relating to the pending manufacturing and sale of our non-lethal products in the United States.\nThe classification of our LEC System devices is subject to ATF. There can be no assurance that we will not experience\ndifficulties with our efforts to comply with applicable regulations as they change in the future or that our continued\ncompliance efforts (or failure to comply with applicable requirements) will not have a material adverse effect on our results\nof operations, business, prospects, and financial condition. Failure to comply with present and future laws could restrict our\nability to sell our products and expand our operations.\nRapid technological development could result in obsolescence or short product life cycles of our products.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards, which could\nresult in product obsolescence or short product life cycles. Accordingly, our success is dependent upon our ability to anticipate\ntechnological changes in the industries we serve and to successfully identify, obtain, develop and market new products that\nsatisfy evolving industry requirements. There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop new products or enhance\nand improve our existing products or that any new products and enhanced and improved existing products will achieve market\nacceptance. Further, there can be no assurance that competitors will not market products that have perceived advantages over\nour products or which render the products currently sold by us obsolete or less marketable.\nWe must commit significant resources to developing, testing and demonstrating new products before knowing whether our\ninvestments will result in products the market will accept. To remain competitive, we may be required to invest significantly\ngreater resources than currently anticipated in research and development and product enhancement efforts, and result in\nincreased operating expenses.\nOur industry is highly competitive.\nThe industry for non-lethal products and tactical systems is highly competitive and composed of many domestic and foreign\ncompanies. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience, substantial competition from numerous competitors\nwhom we expect to continue to improve their products and technologies. Competitors may announce and introduce new\nproducts, services or enhancements that better meet the needs of end-users or changing industry standards, or achieve greater\nmarket acceptance due to pricing, sales channels or other factors. With substantially greater financial resources and operating\nscale than we do currently, certain competitors may be able to respond more quickly than us to changes in end-user\nrequirements and devote greater resources to the enhancement, promotion and sale of their products. Such competition could\nadversely affect our ability to win new contracts and sales.\nSince we operate in evolving markets, our business and future prospects may be difficult to evaluate.\nOur defense and security technologies are in new and rapidly evolving markets. The commercial defense and security markets\nwe target are in early stages of customer adoption. Accordingly, our business and future prospects may be difficult to evaluate.\nWe cannot accurately predict the extent to which demand for our products and services will develop and/or increase, if at all.\nThe challenges, risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets could impact our\nability to do the following:\n• generate sufficient revenue to obtain and/or maintain profitability;\n• acquire and maintain market share;\n• achieve or manage growth in operations;\n• develop and renew contracts;\n• attract and retain additional engineers and other highly-qualified personnel;\n• successfully develop and commercially market products and services;\n• adapt to new or changing policies and spending priorities of governments and government agencies; and\n• access additional capital when required or on reasonable terms.\n34 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nIf we fail to address these and other challenges, risks and uncertainties successfully, our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition would be materially harmed.\nUncertainty related to exportation could limit our operations in the future.\nWe must comply with Canadian federal and provincial laws regulating the export of our products. In some cases, explicit\nauthorization from the Canadian government is needed to export certain products. The export regulations and the governing\npolicies applicable to our business are subject to change. We cannot provide assurance that such export authorizations will\nbe available for our products in the future. To date, compliance with these laws has not significantly limited our operations,\nbut could significantly limit them in the future. Noncompliance with applicable export regulations could potentially expose\nus to fines, penalties and sanctions. If we cannot obtain required government approvals under applicable regulations, we may\nnot be able to sell our products in certain international jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, prospects,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal economic turmoil and regional economic conditions in the United States could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to the risks pertaining to COVID-19 disclosed above, global economic turmoil may cause a general tightening in\nthe credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, levels of intervention from the\nUnited States federal government and other foreign governments, decreased consumer confidence, overall slower economic\nactivity, and extreme volatility in credit, equity, and fixed income markets. A decrease in economic activity in the United\nStates or in other regions of the world in which we do business could adversely affect demand for our products, thus reducing\nour revenues and earnings. A decline in economic conditions could reduce sales of our products.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition\nWe face substantial capital requirements and financial risk.\nTo be successful, our business requires a substantial investment of capital. The production, acquisition, and distribution of\nproprietary technology for game-changing applications in the security forces and personal defense markets require substantial\ncapital. A significant amount of time may elapse between our expenditure of funds and the receipt of revenues. This may\nrequire a significant portion of funds from equity, credit, and other financing sources to fund the business. There can be no\nassurance that these arrangements will continue to be successfully implemented or will not be subject to substantial financial\nrisks relating to the production, acquisition, and distribution of proprietary technology for game-changing applications in the\nsecurity forces and personal defense markets. In addition, if demand increases through internal growth or acquisition, there\nmay be an increase to overhead and/or larger up-front payments for production and, consequently, these increases bear greater\nfinancial risks. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating\nresults, liquidity, and prospects.\nWe may require additional capital.\nWe may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds to fund our working capital requirement and\nbusiness growth. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing\nshareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and\nprivileges superior to those of holders of the Common Shares. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve\nrestrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which might make\nit more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities.\nWe can provide no assurance that sufficient debt or equity financing will be available on reasonable terms or at all to support\nour business growth and to respond to business challenges and failure to obtain sufficient debt or equity financing when\n35 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nrequired could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash\nflows.\nOver the short-term, we expect to incur operating losses and generate negative cash flow until we can produce sufficient\nrevenues to cover our costs. We may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to\nsustain or increase our profitability in the future. There are substantial uncertainties associated with our ability to achieving\nand sustaining profitability. We expect our current cash position will be reduced due to future operating losses and working\ncapital requirements, and we cannot provide certainty as to how long our cash position will last or that we will be able to\naccess additional capital if and when necessary.\nExercise of options or warrants or vesting of restricted stock units will have a dilutive effect on your percentage ownership\nand will result in a dilution of your voting power and an increase in the number of Common Shares eligible for future resale\nin the public market, which may negatively impact the trading price of our Common Shares.\nWe may need to divest assets if there is insufficient capital.\nIf sufficient capital is not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, eliminate or divest one or more of our\nassets or products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, or results\nof operations.\nWe have broad discretion over the use of net proceeds from future capital raises.\nWe will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from any future capital raises. Because of the number and\nvariability of factors that will determine our use of such proceeds, the ultimate use might vary substantially from the planned\nuse. Investors may not agree with how we allocate or spend the proceeds from future capital raises. We may pursue\ncollaborations that ultimately do not result in an increase in the market value of the Common Shares and that instead increase\nour losses.\nCurrency fluctuations may have a material effect on us.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar, other currencies and the Canadian dollar may have a\nmaterial effect on our results of operations. To date, we have not engaged in currency hedging activities. To the extent that\nwe may seek to implement hedging techniques in the future with respect to our foreign currency transactions, there can be no\nassurance that we will be successful in such hedging activities.\nUnavailability of adequate director and officer insurance could make it difficult for us to retain and attract qualified\ndirectors and could also impact our liquidity.\nWe have directors and officers liability (“D&O”) insurance we believe to be adequate to cover risk exposure for the Company\nand our directors and officers, who we indemnify to the full extent permitted by law, there is no guaranty that such coverage\nwill be adequate in the event of litigation.\nOur coverage needs for D&O insurance may change or increase in the future for various reasons including changes in our\nmarket capitalization, changes in trading volume or changes in the listing rules of exchanges or marketplaces on which our\nsecurities may trade from time to time. There is no guaranty that such coverage will be available or available at reasonable\nrates. Further, our current D&O insurance policy will not cover us if we uplist to a national listing in the United States, such\nas NASDAQ. as we currently plan. While we intend to seek new D&O insurance before completing an uplist to a national\nlisting in the United States and to increase our D&O coverage as needed in the future, there can be no assurance that we will\nbe able to do so at reasonable rates or at all, or in amounts adequate to cover expenses and liability should litigation occur.\nWithout adequate D&O insurance, the costs of litigation including amounts we would pay to indemnify our officers and\ndirectors should they be subject to legal action based on their service to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition, results of operations and liquidity. Further, if we are unable to obtain adequate D&O insurance in the future for\n36 | P age\nKWESST MICRO SYSTEMS INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2021\nany reason, we may have difficultly retaining and attracting talented and skilled directors and officers, which could adversely\naffect our business, and may be unable to list our Common Shares on a national exchange in the United States, which could\nimpact the liquidity and value of our stock.\nOur insurance policies may be inadequate to fully protect us from material judgments and expenses.\nWe require insurance coverage for a number of risks, including business interruption, environmental matters and\ncontamination, personal injury and property damage as well as general aviation liability coverage. Although we maintain\ninsurance policies, we cannot provide assurance that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments\nand expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical\nprices or at all. A successful product liability claim could result in substantial cost to us. If insurance coverage is unavailable\nor insufficient to cover any such claims, our financial resources, results of operations and prospects could be adversely\naffected.\nEven if we are fully insured as it relates to a claim, the claim could nevertheless diminish our brand and divert management’s\nattention and resources, which could have a negative impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations.\n37 | P age"

On the day of the\nMeeting, Registered Shareholders will be able to vote during the live webcast by completing a ballot online\nduring the Meeting and by logging in to the Meeting platform using the link provided 24 hours before the\nstart of the Meeting or any adjournment thereof.\n(b) Proxyholders\nA Registered Shareholder submitting a form of proxy also has the right to appoint a person (who need not\nbe a shareholder) to represent him or her at the Meeting other than the persons indicated in the form of\nproxy provided by the Company. To exercise that right, the name of the registered shareholder’s\nproxyholder must be legibly printed in the blank space provided. In addition, the registered shareholder\nmust notify the proxyholder of their appointment, obtain their consent to act as proxyholder and instruct\nhim or her on how the registered shareholder’s shares are to be voted. Following receipt of the duly\ncompleted form of proxy, the Transfer Agent will send by email to your proxyholder a 12-digit\nproxyholder control number that the proxyholder will be able to use in order to register to the Meeting\nplatform. In order to register, the proxyholder must fill out the online registration form available at\nhttps://bit.ly/3X1iR0j with the requested information, i.e., their full name, email address and 12-digit\nproxyholder control number.

By doing so, Beneficial Shareholders are\ninstructing their nominee to appoint them as appointee. A Beneficial Shareholder submitting a voting\ninstruction form also has the right to appoint a person (who need not be a shareholder) to represent him or\nher at the Meeting other than the persons designated in the voting instruction form provided by the\nCompany. To exercise that right, the name of the Beneficial Shareholder’s appointee must be legibly\nprinted in the blank space provided. In addition, the Beneficial Shareholder must notify the appointee of\ntheir appointment, obtain their consent to act as appointee and instruct him or her on how the Beneficial\nShareholder’s shares are to be voted.

Such 12-digit appointee control number will be different from the “control number” indicated\non the voting instruction form provided by the Transfer Agent. This appointee information is necessary to\nallow the appointee to vote at the Meeting. The steps set forth above must be completed prior to the proxy\ndeadline, failing which the appointee will not be able to vote at the Meeting. On the day of the Meeting,\nappointees will be able to vote during the live webcast by completing a ballot online during the Meeting\nand by logging in to the Meeting platform using the link provided 24 hours before the start of the Meeting\nor any adjournment thereof.\n1.4 Appointment of proxies\nA Registered Shareholder may vote in person at the Meeting or may appoint another person to represent\nsuch Registered Shareholder as proxy and to vote the Common Shares of such Registered Shareholder at\nthe Meeting. In order to appoint another person as proxy, a Registered Shareholder must complete, execute\nand deliver the form of proxy accompanying this Circular, or another proper form of proxy, in the manner\nspecified in the Notice of Meeting.\nThe purpose of a form of proxy is to designate persons who will vote on the Shareholder’s behalf in\naccordance with the instructions given by the Shareholder in the form of proxy. The persons named in the\n3 | P a g e\nenclosed form of proxy are officers or directors of the Company. A REGISTERED SHAREHOLDER\nDESIRING TO APPOINT SOME OTHER PERSON, WHO NEED NOT BE A SHAREHOLDER\nOF THE COMPANY, TO REPRESENT HIM, HER OR IT AT THE MEETING MAY DO SO BY\nFILLING IN THE NAME OF SUCH PERSON IN THE BLANK SPACE PROVIDED IN THE\nFORM OF PROXY OR BY COMPLETING ANOTHER PROPER FORM OF PROXY. A\nRegistered Shareholder wishing to be represented by proxy at the Meeting or any adjournment thereof\nmust, in all cases, deposit the completed form of proxy with the Transfer Agent not later than 3:00 p.m.\n(EST) on September 25, 2024 or, if the Meeting is adjourned, not later than 48 hours, excluding Saturdays,\nSundays and holidays, preceding the time of such adjourned Meeting at which the form of proxy is to be\nused. A form of proxy should be executed by the Registered Shareholder, or their attorney duly authorized\nin writing or, if the Registered Shareholder is a corporation, by an officer or attorney thereof duly\nauthorized.\nProxies may be deposited with the Transfer Agent using one of the following methods:\nBy Hand or Mail Delivery TSX Trust Company\nSuite 301, 100 Adelaide Street West\nToronto, Ontario, M5H 4H1\nFacsimile: 416-595-9593\nBy Internet: www.voteproxyonline.com\nYou will need to provide your 12 digit control number (located on the\nform of proxy accompanying this Circular)\nA Registered Shareholder attending the Meeting virtually has the right to vote virtually and, if he, she or\nit does so, his, her or its form of proxy is nullified with respect to the matters such person votes upon at\nthe Meeting and any subsequent matters thereafter to be voted upon at the Meeting or any adjournment\nthereof.\n1.5 Revocation of proxies\nA Registered Shareholder who has given a proxy may revoke it by an instrument in writing executed by\nthe Shareholder or by their representative authorized in writing. If the Shareholder is a company, the\nrevocation must be signed by a representative of the Company, or their representative authorized in\nwriting. The revocation of a proxy must be deposited at the registered office of the Company or with the\nTransfer Agent at the address set out in the enclosed form of proxy and notice of meeting, no later than at\nthe close of business on the last business day preceding the day of the Meeting or any adjournment thereof,\nor with the chairman at the Meeting or any adjournment thereof.\nAlso, note that if you are a Registered Shareholder and use your control number to log in to the Meeting,\nany vote you cast at the Meeting will revoke any proxy you previously submitted. If you do not wish to\nrevoke a previously submitted proxy or voting instruction form, as the case may be, you should not vote\nduring the Meeting\n1.6 Notice to Beneficial Shareholders\nNational Instrument 54-101 - Communication with beneficial Owners of Securities of a Reporting Issuer\n4 | P a g e\n(“NI-54-101”) requires brokers and other intermediaries to seek voting instructions from Beneficial\nShareholders in advance of shareholders’ meetings. The various brokers and other intermediaries have\ntheir own mailing procedures and provide their own return instructions to clients, which should be\ncarefully followed by Beneficial Shareholders in order to ensure that their shares are voted at the Meeting.\nThe form of proxy supplied to a Beneficial Shareholder by its broker (or the agent of the broker) is\nsubstantially similar to the form of proxy provided directly to Registered Shareholders.\nThe vast majority of brokers now delegate responsibility of obtaining instructions from clients to\nBroadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (“BFSI”) in Canada. BFSI typically prepares a machine-readable\nvoting instruction form, mails those forms to Beneficial Shareholders and asks Beneficial Shareholders to\nreturn the forms to BFSI, or otherwise communicate voting instructions to BFSI (by way of the Internet\nor telephone, for example). BFSI then tabulates the results of all instructions received and provides\nappropriate instructions respecting the voting of shares to be represented at the Meeting. A Beneficial\nShareholder who receives a BFSI voting instruction form cannot use that form to vote shares directly at\nthe Meeting. The voting instruction forms must be returned to BFSI (or instructions respecting the voting\nof shares must otherwise be communicated to BFSI) well in advance of the Meeting in order to have the\nshares voted. If you have any questions respecting the voting of shares held through a broker or other\nintermediary, please contact your broker or other intermediary of assistance.\nThis Information Circular and accompanying materials are being sent to both Registered Shareholders and\nBeneficial Shareholders. Beneficial Shareholders fall into two categories - those who object to their\nidentity being known to the issuers of securities which they own (“Objecting Beneficial Owners”, or\n“OBO’s”) and those who do not object to their identity being known to the issuers of the securities they\nown (“Non-Objecting Beneficial Owners”, or “NOBO’s”). Subject to the provision of NI-54-101 issuers\nmay request and obtain a list of their NOBO’s from intermediaries via their transfer agents. If you are a\nBeneficial Shareholder, and the Company or its agent has sent these materials directly to you, your name,\naddress and information about your holdings of common shares have been obtained in accordance with\napplicable securities regulatory requirements from the intermediary holding the common shares on your\nbehalf. By choosing to send these materials to you directly, the Company (and not the intermediary holding\nthe common shares on your behalf) has assumed responsibility for delivering these materials to you and\nexecuting your proper voting instructions. Please return your voting instructions as specified in the request\nfor voting instructions.\nThe Company’s OBO’s can expect to be contacted by BFSI or their brokers or their broker’s agents as set\nout above.\nAlthough a Beneficial Shareholder may not be recognized directly at the Meeting for the purposes of\nvoting shares registered in the name of his or her broker (or his or her broker’s agent), a Beneficial\nShareholder may attend the Meeting as proxyholder for the Registered Shareholder and vote the shares as\nproxyholder for the Registered Shareholder by entering his or her own name in the blank space on the\nproxy form provided to him or her by his or her broker (or his or her broker’s agent) and return it to that\nbroker (or that broker’s agent) in accordance with the broker’s instructions (or the agent’s instructions).\nAll references to shareholders in this Information Circular, the enclosed form of proxy and the Notice of\nMeeting are to the Registered Shareholders unless specifically stated otherwise.\n5 | P a g e\n1.6 Exercise of Discretion by Proxyholders and Appointees\nCommon Shares represented by properly executed proxies or voting instruction forms in favour of\nthe proxyholders named in the enclosed form of proxy and the appointees named in the enclosed\nvoting instruction form, in the absence of any direction to the contrary, will be voted FOR the\nadoption of a resolution authorizing, if deemed advisable by the board of directors of the Company,\nthe consolidation, no later than twelve months from the date of the Meeting, of the issued and\noutstanding common shares of the Company on the basis of one common share for a maximum of\nevery fifty (50) common shares issued and outstanding.\nThe proxyholder named in the form of proxy or the appointee named in the voting instruction form, as the\ncase may be, shall have discretionary authority with respect to amendments or variations to matters\nidentified in the notice of meeting and with respect to other matters which may properly come before the\nMeeting. At the time of printing this Circular, the management of the Company is not aware of any such\namendments, variations or other matters. In the event of a ballot, the shares represented by proxy will be\nvoted by the proxyholder or the appointee, as the case may be, in accordance with the instructions of the\nshareholder with respect to the matters set out in the form of proxy.\n1.7 Interest of certain persons in the matters to be acted upon\nTo the knowledge of the directors and executive officers of the Company, no director or executive officer\nof the Company, any proposed nominee for election as director of the Company, or any associate or\naffiliate of any of the foregoing persons, has any material interest, direct or in direct, by way of beneficial\nownership of securities or otherwise, in any matter to be acted upon at the Meeting.\n1.8 Record date\nThe directors of the Company have fixed Tuesday, August 20, 2024, as the record date (the “Record\nDate”) for the purpose of determining the Shareholders entitled to receive the notice of meeting, and\nauthorized to vote or act at the Meeting. No shareholder who has become a shareholder after the Record\nDate will be entitled to attend or vote at the Meeting or any adjournment(s) thereof.\n1.9 Voting securities and Quorum\nThe authorized capital of the Company consists of an unlimited number of Common Shares. As of the\ndate hereof, 15,791,742 Common Shares were issued and outstanding as fully paid and non-assessable.\nA quorum shall be present at the Meeting if two or more holders of Common Shares representing at least\n5% of the total number of voting rights attaching to the said Common Shares entitled to be voted at the\nMeeting are present or represented by proxy.\n1.10 Principal holder of voting securities\nAs of the date hereof, to the knowledge of our directors and executive officers, no person or company\nbeneficially owns, or controls or directs, directly or indirectly, Common Shares carrying 10% or more of\n6 | P a g e\nthe voting rights attached to all of the Common Shares.\nSECTION 2 - BUSINESS TO BE TRANSACTED AT THE MEETING\nSHARE CONSOLIDATION\nOn May 16, 2024, the Company received a notification letter (the “Notification Letter”) from the Nasdaq\nStock Market (“Nasdaq”) advising the Company that it was not in compliance with Listing Rule\n5550(a)(2), as the bid price of the Company’s Common Shares on the Nasdaq had closed at less than\nUS$1.00 per share over the prior 30 consecutive business days (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”).\nThe Notification Letter indicated that the Company has until November 12, 2024 (the “Compliance\nPeriod”) to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.\nWhile the Company’s governing statute, the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) does not\nrequire the approval of Shareholders in order to give effect to the Consolidation, the policies of the TSX\nVenture Exchange require that a consolidation of a company’s share capital at a ratio greater than 10:1 be\napproved by a company’s shareholders.\nAccordingly, shareholders will be asked to approve a resolution in the form described below (the\n“Consolidation Resolution”), authorizing, if deemed advisable by the board of directors, the\nconsolidation of the issued and outstanding Common Shares of the Company on the basis of one share for\na maximum of every fifty (50) Common Shares issued and outstanding (the “Share Consolidation”) in\norder to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. In order to be adopted, the\nConsolidation Resolution must be approved by at the majority of the votes cast by the holders of the\nCommon Shares, either present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting. Unless otherwise\nspecified, the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy intend to vote for the Consolidation\nResolution.\nIf the Consolidation Resolution is adopted by the shareholders, the consolidation shall be effected by the\nboard of directors only if and when deemed advisable by the board of directors in its discretion, but in no\ncase later than twelve months from the date of the Meeting. In such event, subject to the maximum referred\nto above, the determination of the basis for the consolidation will be at the discretion of the board of\ndirectors but shall not exceed a basis of one share for a maximum of every fifty (50) Common Shares\nissued and outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Consolidation Resolution authorizes the board\nof directors to (i) determine the appropriate ratio of the Consolidation subject to the maximum ration\ncontemplated by the Consolidation Resolution and (ii) abandon the Share Consolidation without further\napproval from the shareholders. Unless otherwise specified, the persons named in the accompanying form\nof proxy intend to vote for the Consolidation Resolution.\nIn the event that the Share Consolidation would result in a Registered Shareholder holding a fraction of a\ncommon share, such fractional common share shall be rounded to the nearest whole number of Common\nShares and any fractional common share post-Share Consolidation will be cancelled without payment of\nany consideration. In all other respects, the post-consolidation Common Shares will have the same\nattributes as the existing Common Shares. The Share Consolidation will not change a shareholder's\nproportionate interest in the Company, even though such ownership will be represented by a smaller\n7 | P a g e\nnumber of Common Shares.\nThe principal effect of the Share Consolidation will be that the number of Common Shares issued and\noutstanding will be reduced from 15,791,742 Common Shares as of August 26, 2024 to 315,834 Common\nShares, assuming a maximum consolidation ratio of 50:1. The following table sets out the percentage\nreduction in the number of outstanding Common Shares and the number of Common Shares that would\nbe outstanding as a result of a consolidation at the ratios indicated:\nPercentage Reduction in Number of Number of Outstanding Common Shares\nProposed Consolidation Ratio\nOutstanding Common Shares Post-Consolidation\n1 for 50 98% 315,834\nIn general, the Share Consolidation will not be considered to result in a disposition of Common Shares by\nshareholders for Canadian federal income tax purposes. The aggregate adjusted cost base to a shareholder\nfor such purposes of all Common Shares held by the shareholder will not change as a result of the Share\nConsolidation; however, the shareholder’s adjusted cost base per common share will increase\nproportionately.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that the total market capitalization of the Company (the aggregate\nvalue of all Common Shares at the market price then in effect) immediately after the Share Consolidation\nwill be equal to or greater than the total market capitalization immediately before the Share Consolidation.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that the per-share market price of the Common Shares following\nthe Share Consolidation will equal or exceed the direct arithmetical result of the Share Consolidation. In\naddition, a decline in the market price of the Common Shares after the Share Consolidation may result in\na greater percentage decline than would occur in the absence of a Share Consolidation and the liquidity of\nthe Common Shares could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to the issued and outstanding Common Shares, the Common Shares currently reserved for\nissuance by the Company will be adjusted to give effect to the Share Consolidation, such that the number\nof consolidated Common Shares issuable will equal the number obtained when the number of Common\nShares issuable is divided by the conversion number and the exercise prices of outstanding options and/or\nwarrants to purchase consolidated Common Shares will equal the price obtained by multiplying the\nexisting exercise price by the conversion number.\nIf the Consolidation Resolution is passed at the Meeting and the board of directors decides to proceed with\nthe Share Consolidation, the Company will announce that it is proceeding with the consolidation prior to\nthe completion thereof. Registered Shareholders should then, at that time, complete, sign and return the\nLetter of Transmittal that will be sent to such registered holders, along with the share certificate(s)\nrepresenting their pre-consolidation Common Shares, to TSX Trust Company at one of the addresses in\nthe Letter of Transmittal. Upon receipt of a properly-completed and signed Letter of Transmittal and the\nshare certificate(s) referred to in the Letter of Transmittal, the Company will arrange to have a new share\ncertificate representing the appropriate number of post-consolidation Common Shares delivered in\naccordance with the instructions provided by the holder in the Letter of Transmittal. No delivery of a new\ncertificate to a shareholder will be made until the shareholder has surrendered his current issued\ncertificates. Until surrendered, each share certificate formerly representing old Common Shares shall be\n8 | P a g e\ndeemed for all purposes to represent the number of new Common Shares to which the holder is entitled as\na result of the Share Consolidation.\nIf a shareholder’s Common Shares are registered in the name of a nominee (e.g. a trust company, securities\nbroker, or other financial institution), the shareholder will not receive a Letter of Transmittal and should\ncontact its nominee to determine if the shareholder need to do anything to effect the consolidation of its\nCommon Shares.\nShareholders will be asked at the Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, to consider, and if deemed\nadvisable, adopt the following resolutions:\n“WHEREAS on May 16, 2024, the Company received a notification letter (the “Notification Letter”) from\nthe Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) advising the Company that it was not in compliance with Listing\nRule 5550(a)(2), as the bid price of the Company’s common shares (the “Common Shares”) on the\nNasdaq had closed at less than US$1.00 per share over the prior 30 consecutive business days (the\n“Minimum Bid Price Requirement”);\nWHEREAS the Notification Letter indicated that the Company has until November 12, 2024 (the\n“Compliance Period”) to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement;\nWHEREAS the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) is of the opinion that it is in the best\ninterests of the Company and its shareholders (the “Shareholders”) that it be given the discretion to\nproceed with a consolidation of the issued and outstanding Common Shares on the basis of a maximum of\none new Common Share for every fifty (50) existing Common Shares (the “Consolidation”) in order to\nregain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement;\nWHEREAS as a consequence of the Consolidation, all issued and outstanding options, warrants and other\ninstruments or rights exercisable for or convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares or correlated\nwith the price thereof shall be adjusted in accordance with the terms and conditions of such securities and\ninstruments;\nWHEREAS the Company anticipates that the Consolidation will have a neutral economic effect on\nShareholders and holders of any outstanding options, warrants and other instruments or rights exercisable\nfor or convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares or correlated with the price thereof, except to the\nextent the Consolidation will result in fractional shares;\nWHEREAS pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) governing the Company and\nthe constating documents of the Company, the Consolidation does not require the approval of\nShareholders; however, the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange require shareholder approval for any\nsecurity consolidation which, when combined with any other security consolidation conducted by the\nIssuer within the previous 24 months that was not approved by its Shareholders, would result in a\ncumulative consolidation ratio of greater than 10 to 1 over such 24 month period.\nBE AND IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED:\n9 | P a g e\nCONSOLIDATION OF THE COMMON SHARES\n1. The Company is hereby authorized to alter its share structure by consolidating each of the\nissued and outstanding Common Shares of the Company by exchanging up to fifty (50)\nCommon Shares of the Company, or such lesser or greater amount as the directors of the\nCompany may determine, into one (1) Common Share of the Company, provided that in the\nevent the consolidation would result in a shareholder of the Company holding a fraction of a\nshare, no such fractional share will be issued, but the number of Common Shares to be\nreceived by such shareholder that is less than 1/2 of a share must be cancelled and each\nfractional share that is at least 1/2 of a share must be changed to one whole share in\naccordance with section 83 of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the\n“Consolidation”).\n2. The Consolidation shall be effective at 12:01 a.m. (Eastern time) on the date determined by\nthe board of directors of the Company and approved by the relevant regulatory authorities\n(the “Effective Date”), be and is hereby authorized and approved.\n3.
