Since acquiring the Merom Power Plant in 2022, we have expanded our offerings from fuel production to wholesale electricity sales, and we are now moving further up the chain to begin powering the industrial end user, including through a signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Hoosier and WIN REMC earlier this year. Since that time, we have carried out a data center targeted Request for Proposal (RFP) that has received a robust response and is in active negotiations, further strengthening our conviction that power is in critical demand and that we possess a crucial component to the success of these data centers.”\n\n“In the near term, we are facing a challenging market for spot electricity sales. Record natural gas production last year, combined with the second warmest winter in 25 years, has led to a surplus in natural gas inventory. This imbalance has driven down both gas and electricity prices, resulting in an energy market where pricing was above our cost structure only 40% of the time during the first half of the year.”\n\n“In response to the current environment, we have focused on strengthening our balance sheet by reducing debt and improving our total liquidity to $60.7 million at quarter-end. This was driven in-part by the receipt of a $45 million prepayment during the quarter for an 11-month forward power sale, representing 22% of our projected annual output. As natural gas inventories decrease and prices recover later this year, as we currently expect, we are well positioned to navigate the current environment and drive future power sales that can reshape Hallador’s financial profile.”\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * **The Company generated $23.5 million in operating cash flow during the second quarter, which partially supported repayment of debt and funding capex.**\n    * Total bank debt was $45.5 million with total liquidity of $60.7 million at June 30, 2024. This compares to total bank debt of $91.5 million and total liquidity of $26.2 million at December 31, 2023.\n    * The Company’s leverage ratio was 2.12x at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.32x at December 31, 2023.\n    * Capital expenditures were $13.2 million for the second quarter and $28.0 million year-to-date. The Company remains on track with its targeted $43 million capital expenditure budget for 2024.\n\n\n  * **Hallador continues to emphasize electric sales as an independent power producer.**\n    * Electric Sales were $56.8 million compared to $71.0 million in the year-ago period. The decrease was driven by the buildup of natural gas inventory levels in the broader market reducing the demand for and pricing of electric power. \n    * Coal Sales were $32.8 million compared to $88.6 million in the year-ago period. The decrease was driven by lower demand due to lower natural gas prices.\n\n\n  * **The Company continues to focus on forward sales to hedge its energy position.**\n    * At quarter-end, Hallador had total forward energy and capacity sales to 3rd party customers of $871.7 million through 2029.\n    * The Company signed an 11-month, $45 million forward power purchase agreement (PPA) during the quarter with one of the largest global asset managers.\n    * Negotiations continue to advance in response to the Company’s data center targeted RFP, with the potential to sign a long-term contract.\n\n**Financial Summary** _($ in Millions and Unaudited)_  \n---  \n**Q2 2023**| **Q1 2024**| **Q2 2024**  \n**Electric Sales**|  $| 71.0| $| 58.8| $| 56.8  \n**Coal Sales** **- 3****rd****Party**|  $| 88.6| $| 49.6| $| 32.8  \n**Other Revenue**|  $| 1.6| $| 1.3| $| 1.3  \n**Total Revenue**|  $| 161.2| $| 109.7| $| 90.9  \n**Net Income (Loss)**|  $| 16.9| $| (1.7| )| $| (10.2| )  \n**Operating Cash Flow**|  $| 18.1| $| 16.4| $| 23.5  \n**Adjusted EBITDA***|  $| 35.3| $| 6.8| $| (5.8| )  \n  \n_* Non-GAAP financial measure, defined as operating cash flows_  _less effects of certain subsidiary and equity method investment activity, plus bank interest, less effects of working capital period changes, plus other amortization_\n\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our method of computing Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies.\n\nManagement believes the non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA, is an important measure in analyzing our liquidity and is a key component of certain material covenants contained within our Credit Agreement, specifically a maximum leverage ratio and a debt service coverage ratio. Noncompliance with the leverage ratio or debt service coverage ratio covenants could result in our lenders requiring the Company to immediately repay all amounts borrowed. If we cannot satisfy these financial covenants, we would be prohibited under our Credit Agreement from engaging in certain activities, such as incurring additional indebtedness, making certain payments, and acquiring and disposing of assets. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA is critical to the assessment of our liquidity. The required amount of Adjusted EBITDA is a variable based on our debt outstanding and/or required debt payments at the time of the quarterly calculation based on a rolling prior 12-month period.\n\nReconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA, to cash provided by operating activities, the most comparable GAAP measure, is as follows (in thousands) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**Reconciliation of GAAP \"Cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" to non-GAAP \"Adjusted EBITDA\"** **(In $ Thousands and Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Six Months Ended**  \n**June 30,**| **June 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Cash provided by operating activities**|  $| 23,522| $| 18,131| $| 39,891| $| 44,243  \nCurrent income tax expense| —| 61| —| 493  \nLoss from Hourglass Sands| —| 1| 1| 2  \nLoss from Sunrise Indemnity| 6| —| 12| —  \nDistribution from Sunrise Energy| —| —| —| (625| )  \nBank and convertible note interest expense| 3,326| 2,517| 6,859| 5,204  \nWorking capital period changes| (30,305| )| 12,546| (43,480| )| 16,390  \nOther long-term asset and liability changes| (466| )| (253| )| (1,403| )| (704| )  \nASC 606 Capacity Adjustment| (2,455| )| —| (3,703| )| —  \nCash paid on asset retirement obligation reclamation| (37| )| 566| 602| 931  \nOther amortization| 613| 1,728| 2,248| 3,378  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**|  $| (5,796| )| $| 35,297| $| 1,027| $| 69,312  \n**Cash (used in) provided by investing activities**|  $| (10,720| )| $| (17,081| )| $| (25,570| )| $| (30,548| )  \n**Cash (used in) provided by financing activities**|  $| (8,446| )| $| (1,029| )| $| (10,716| )| $| (13,751| )  \n  \n**Solid Forward Sales Position -

The proposed transaction involves selling the energy and capacity to the end-user through a utility or cooperative, which would be an “in front of the meter” transaction in contrast to the “behind the meter” structures that have created recent regulatory challenges for others. If we are successful in executing definitive agreements, the proposed transaction would contract the majority of our plant’s energy and capacity at prices higher than the forward curve for more than a decade to come.\n\n“While we have not yet reached binding agreements, we are encouraged by our progress with this partner and by the strong interest we continue to see from other potential counterparties in our energy and capacity offerings, which have been bolstered by Indiana’s efforts to attract datacenters and other high density power users with its business-friendly climate and favorable tax policy. We believe we hold a considerable portion of the remaining unsold accredited capacity in MISO Zone 6, covering Indiana and parts of western Kentucky and we are well positioned to take advantage of the significant demand for our capacity.”\n\nBilsland continued, “Additionally, we have made considerable strides in strengthening our balance sheet in recent months. Subsequent to quarter end, we executed a $60 million prepaid power purchase agreement (PPA) and utilized $20 million of the proceeds to pay down bank term debt and $34 million to pay down the revolver. At the end of October our bank debt balance was $23.5 million compared to $91.5 million outstanding at the end of 2023. Between our strengthened balance sheet and an improving environment for both coal and power sales, we are poised to exit 2024 on strong footing which should allow us to capitalize on the long-term multi-year growth opportunities ahead.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * **Hallador returned to growth on both the top and bottom line compared to the second quarter.**\n    * Total revenue increased 12% to $105 million, driven by a 21% increase in electric sales to $71.7 million. This marks a near Company record for electric sales revenue mix, as Hallador continues to emphasize electric sales as an independent power producer. \n    * Net income increased to $1.6 million compared to $(10.2) million in the second quarter, with adjusted EBITDA up significantly to $9.6 million compared to $(5.8) million as the Company returned to profitability through improved power pricing and lower costs per MWh at its Merom Power Plant. \n  * **The Company is now strengthening its balance sheet (post quarter-end) without equity dilution.**\n    * Total bank debt was $70.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $45.5 million at June 30, 2024 and $91.5 million at December 31, 2023. \n    * Total liquidity was $34.9 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $60.7 million at June 30, 2024 and $26.2 million at December 31, 2023. \n    * Subsequent to quarter-end, the Company secured a $60 million prepaid PPA and utilized $20 million of the proceeds to pay down bank term debt and $34 million to pay down its revolver. At October 31, 2024, total bank debt was $23.5 million and total liquidity was $53.8 million. \n    * The Company did not utilize its ATM program in the third quarter or subsequent to quarter-end. \n  * **Hallador continues to focus on forward sales to secure its energy position.**\n    * At quarter-end, Hallador had total forward energy, capacity and coal sales to 3rd party customers of $937.2 million through 2029, up from $871.7 at the end of the second quarter. \n    * Hallador signed a non-binding term sheet with a leading global data center developer to support the delivery of energy and capacity to a large load end user customer for 10+ years. The completion of the proposed transaction is subject to, among other matters, the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements and there can be no assurance that definitive agreements will be entered into or that the proposed transaction will be consummated on the terms or timeframe currently contemplated, or at all.\n\n**Financial Summary** _($ in Millions and Unaudited)_  \n---  \n**Q3 2023**| **Q1 2024**| **Q2 2024**| **Q3 2024**  \n**Electric Sales**|  $| 67.4| $| 58.8| $| 56.8| $| 71.7  \n**Coal Sales** **- 3****rd****Party**|  $| 97.4| $| 49.6| $| 32.8| $| 31.7  \n**Other Revenue**|  $| 1.0| $| 1.3| $| 1.3| $| 1.6  \n**Total Revenue**|  $| 165.8| $| 109.7| $| 90.9| $| 105.0  \n**Net Income (Loss)**|  $| 16.1| $| (1.7| )| $| (10.2| )| $| 1.6  \n**Operating Cash Flow**|  $| 35.3| $| 16.4| $| 23.5| $| (12.9| )  \n**Adjusted EBITDA***|  $| 35.9| $| 6.8| $| (5.8| )| $| 9.6  \n  \n________________________* Non-GAAP financial measure, defined as operating cash flows_ _less effects of certain subsidiary and equity method investment activity, plus bank interest, less effects of working capital period changes, plus other amortization_\n\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our method of computing Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies.\n\nManagement believes the non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA, is an important measure in analyzing our liquidity and is a key component of certain material covenants contained within our Credit Agreement, specifically the minimum quarterly EBITDA. Noncompliance with the covenants could result in our lenders requiring the Company to immediately repay all amounts borrowed. If we cannot satisfy these financial covenants, we would be prohibited under our Credit Agreement from engaging in certain activities, such as incurring additional indebtedness, making certain payments, and acquiring and disposing of assets. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA is critical to the assessment of our liquidity. The required amount of Adjusted EBITDA is a variable based on our debt outstanding and/or required debt payments at the time of the quarterly calculation based on a rolling prior 12‑month period.\n\nReconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA, to cash provided by operating activities, the most comparable GAAP measure, is as follows (in thousands) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**Reconciliation of GAAP \"Cash provided by (used in) operating activities\" to non-GAAP \"Adjusted EBITDA\"** **(In $ Thousands and Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 30,**| **September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Cash provided by operating activities**|  $| (12,906| )| $| 35,284| $| 26,985| $| 79,527  \nCurrent income tax expense| —| (178| )| —| 315  \nLoss from Hourglass Sands| —| 1| 1| 3  \nLoss from Sunrise Indemnity| —| —| 12| —  \nDistribution from Sunrise Energy| —| —| —| (625| )  \nBank and convertible note interest expense| 2,254| 2,428| 9,113| 7,632  \nWorking capital period changes| 18,821| (8,285| )| (24,659| )| 8,105  \nOther long-term asset and liability changes| 51| (210| )| (1,352| )| (914| )  \nASC 606 Capacity Adjustment| —| 3,703| (3,703| )| 3,703  \nCash paid on asset retirement obligation reclamation| 218| 1,355| 820| 2,286  \nOther amortization| 1,119| 1,822| 3,367| 5,200  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**|  $| 9,557| $| 35,920| $| 10,584| $| 105,232  \n**Cash (used in) provided by investing activities**|  $| (10,663| )| $| (18,136| )| $| (36,233| )| $| (48,684| )  \n**Cash (used in) provided by financing activities**|  $| 22,482| $| (16,802| )| $| 11,766| $| (30,553| )  \n**Solid Forward Sales Position -
